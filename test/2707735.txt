368412	2707735	33075	2.0	" Now listen sister , don't try any of your funny business , or someone's liable to get hurt . "	Oh boy , this one is truly pathetic , and not even in a Mystery Science Theater kind of way . I had some hopes with the appearance of the spooky Dr . Jackson ( Laura Bowman ) ; she reveals an enigmatic back story of running off to Africa after Eleanor Lindsay's parents died in a tornado when she was only ten months old . She returned home twenty years later to work on her reputation as the neighborhood curmudgeon , an enterprise that seemed to have been effective . However she shows her appreciation for being invited to the Lindsay's wedding by leaving her home and possessions to them in her will . The thing is , one of those possessions is an ape man named Ingeena , living in the basement which is accessed through a secret panel by sounding a Chinese gong . When Ingeena gulps down Dr . Jackson's greatest discovery in medicine since Louis Pasteur , he goes , well , ape . From there on out he goes on a murder rampage that eventually leaves three people dead ( Dr . Jackson , Attorney Bradshaw , and Jackson's brother ) . It's all about as exciting as the paragraph you just read , because there is no suspense in the entire proceedings to make any of it remotely interesting to watch . There's an entirely laughable scene when Dr . Jackson's brother shoots the creature . When he empties the gun of bullets , he throws it at the ape man , and misses him from five feet away ! Even Superman's TV villains were more accurate than that . Perhaps the most interesting part of the story had nothing at all to do with horror or mystery elements . The newlywed Lindsay's are entertained in their home on the evening of their wedding by the Four Toppers in a couple of lively numbers . One might question why the new couple is spending the night at home , though husband Bob offered an explanation that it was a wedding surprise . Shortly later they abandon it when they inherit the Jackson house . There seemed to be a likable chemistry between the Lindsay's , though it probably wasn't helped by sleeping in separate beds . " Son of Ingagi " is probably best approached as a curiosity piece , billed as one of , if not THE first film with an all black cast . Even that seemed dubious by the appearance of Dr . Jackson and her brother . Some attempt at humor is made with the presence of inept Detective Nelson , as alert in his sleep as he is awake , that is to say , entirely oblivious of what's going on . Even so , you knew he wasn't meant to go out in a blaze of glory , nor for that matter , did the film . Update - / 07 : Today I managed to come across an all black cowboy Western starring Herb Jeffries and Mantan Moreland called " Two Gun Man From Harlem " . It was from 1938 , preceding this one by two years .
367847	2707735	147467	2.0	" . . . and then it happened , I gave myself to him . "	The severely dated production values and stiff performances by the actors immediately calls to mind another ' educational ' gem of the era - " Reefer Madness " . In the name of sex education and the eradication of the evils of socially transmitted disease , the film begins with the earnest entreaty that " Ignorance Must Be Abolished " . But actually , if the presentation wasn't so corny and outmoded , one would be hard pressed to consider whether anything's been learned since the film was made , as the toll in human lives to STD's worldwide is at epidemic proportions . I guess you'd really have to be a viewer back in the 1930's to get the full impact of how titillating a lot of the film was . The burlesque sequence offered a lot more tease than the actual dance show , with a lesbian pursuing a hot conquest and a dirty old man type getting worked up enough to attack the first young lady he sees after the show . The main story involves a would be actress falling victim to an unscrupulous director only to find herself at the mercy of the dreaded syphilis , ultimately infecting her new husband and baby . Not entirely unimaginable , but confounded by the unsavory practices of medical quacks who take advantage of the uneducated and uninformed . As a period piece , this is another example of sensationalist film making and worth a look to see how far we've come as a society and a nation . It's unlikely that anyone reading this was even alive seventy years ago when the film was made , and that in itself is a remarkable testament to the staying power of a cult classic from a bygone era .
367959	2707735	76191	2.0	" You know , there's somethin ' strange going on around here " .	Why do I constantly do this to myself ? I mean , really , it's right there in the title - " The Incredible Melting Man " . What else would I expect ? I have to admit , I'm a sucker for just about anything I come across on the Monster HD channel , but the only redeeming feature of this picture would be that truly grotesque makeup job by the legendary Rick Baker . As for creepy , I'll give the nod to that horny old geezer couple sucking on lemons just before lights out . Now they were truly scary . Something I could never figure out in horror flicks was why a monster's victims wouldn't simply just run away when faced with virtual annihilation . Like the chick in the cabin . You know , there was a door completely visible right there in the kitchen that she could have run right out of at any time . Incredible Steve-O couldn't muster much more than a brisk walk , so why not just blow right by him ? I don't know , maybe I'm missing something . This flick had some of the feel of a ' Tales From The Crypt ' episode , but ' Tales ' usually had a cool or grotesque twist which often times you didn't see coming . This was one picture that you couldn't quite get a handle on coming OR going . For example , in an early scene , you can clearly make out that Melting Man's eyeball fell out of his head , so how did he manage to get around for the rest of the story ? I guess we're not supposed to ask . At eighty four minutes , this picture was about an hour and a half too long . When it was all over , I was ready to take up General Perry on his earlier suggestion - " I could really use a drink about now " .
367704	2707735	53337	2.0	" You are not familiar with the focus and disintegrator ray ? "	OH . . . MY . . . GOD ! ! ! " Teenagers From Outer Space " actually exists and I just finished watching it ! Now don't get me wrong , it's not a worst movie ever candidate , it's too campy and oddly entertaining for that . This is " Father Knows Best " meets " The Outer Limits " with no pretense to be anything other than 1950's grade " Z " sci-fi . In fact , there are times when it's played just a bit too straight and could have used a bit more tongue in cheek , but the goofy dialog in the second half manages to pick up the pace . Alien beings from another planet land on Earth in search of a world on which their Gargon livestock can graze . That the Gargons resemble lobsters is no surprise , since the aliens look just like human beings with perfect command of the English language . Fortunately , no pseudo scientific jargon is offered to explain how this could be , a welcome relief from more " sophisticated " science fiction . Alien Derek ( David Love , short for C . R . Kaltenthaler ) tries to save Earth from lobster fest and divert the ship to another planet , but his peers will have none of that . While Thor ( Bryan Grant ) attempts to track him down , the viewer is treated to just a sampling of the invaders ' awesome power ; their ray guns reduce living beings to mere skeletal remains . So devastating is the effect that newspaper reporter Joe Rogers ' ( Tom Graeff ) response to seeing teenager Alice's skeleton at the bottom of a pool is - " Holy Mackerel " ! ! ! I was impressed by the advanced design of the alien aircraft , when the hatch opens one is visually graced with the futuristic technology of space age hammer and nails . NASA could take a lesson here , since they had to rely on duct tape on their last space mission . The hit of the film though has to be Grandpa Morgan ( Harvey B . Dunn ) . With alien murder and mayhem abounding , Grandpa's afternoon nap won't be denied ! Awakened by reporter Rogers ' arrival , he surmises that granddaughter Betty ( Dawn Bender ) and Derek must be off to the cave of the captive Gargon - " . . . that's where they must have gone , those crazy kids ! " " Teenagers From Outer Space " is no " War of the Worlds " , but that doesn't mean I wouldn't recommend it . At the very least , " surface readings register above minimum requirements " . What truly moves the film into science fiction territory though is Dr . Brandt's first appearance on screen - he's about to make a house call !
367903	2707735	58072	2.0	" This is no real doctor , this is a Sumerian mutant ! "	Keep in mind that the last movie I saw and reviewed just before this one was " Gone With The Wind " . I can't really say why I watch stuff like " Evil Brain From Outer Space " , I guess it's a need to achieve some kind of balance . What surprised me right off the bat was that this was a Japanese monster movie , but without your traditional Godzilla , Gamera or Rodan . It features a Japanese super-hero named Starman sent to Earth to defeat a horde of multiplying Sumerian mutations from the planet Zimar , whose leader Balazar was assassinated by a de-controlled robot . Balazar's brain lives on and plans to conquer Earth via nuclear war . Whew ! Can you keep up with that ? You know , if all the characters in this flick weren't Japanese , I could almost swear it was a sample of Mexican lucha libre , as Starman battles a couple of nasty spandex suited mutants in choreographed martial arts dance routines . It's all fairly well suited for the pre teen-ager , just like most of the Japanese monster films of the same era . I did get a kick out of one scene when the civilian Kuwota opens a book and runs his finger left to right over a line of Japanese writing . Even this novice knows that Japanese is read right to left ! At least the movie gets as much mileage as it can from ' one of the most ingenious devices ever invented ' . With the help of the globe meter , a wristwatch with five dials , one can fly through space , detect radioactivity , and speak and understand all the known languages on Earth . I'll have to get me one of those !
367711	2707735	61850	2.0	" OK , see you day before yesterday . "	It's hard to believe that movies as bad as this were being made as late as 1967 . It's about as technologically advanced as any " B " grade film from the ' 40's , but done in color . However the garish orange of the lab setting and time capsule is so bright it will make you grab for a pair of sunglasses . So much for the high points . " Journey to the Center of Time " would be an embarrassment for a fledgling film student , that it was made at all with real money is to be questioned as much as the film's star Scott Brady questions his company's funding of research in the science of time travel . For two years , Doc Gordon ( Abraham Sofaer ) , Mark Manning ( Anthony Eisley ) and Karen White ( Gigi Perreau ) have only managed to navigate twenty four hours into the past . That's all about to change , as the trio , along with owner Stanton ( Brady ) kick start their time travel gizmo five thousand years into the future for a rendezvous with aspiring screen star Poupee Gamin , surely you recognize her name . One of her futuristic aides is Lyle Waggoner , who fortunately managed to survive this mess to earn a spot on the Carol Burnett Show and later , " Wonder Woman " . The time lab can best be compared to a time travel boomerang ; from the future the gang whips back to one million years B . C . to pick a nice round number , where the greedy Stanton grabs a jewel and takes off in the lab once again , stranding Manning and White in the past . In a series of frenetic flashbacks and flash forwards , the entire movie is relived for those of you who dozed off the first time . Getting beyond the embarrassment , you can have a fun time with this one as long as it's with a bunch of friends and the right mix of refreshments . The film can be enjoyed on many levels ; I know because it made as much sense played in reverse as it did played forward .
368299	2707735	42855	3.0	" What type of women are these ruling wonders who attack men and live in trees ? "	While watching , my mind constantly came back to the question of what would possess someone to make a film like this . Sure , the story's opening hints of romance when the world was young , but then can't decide if it was ten or a hundred thousand years ago . Only one thing is certain with a film like this , with all the scantily clad women center stage , it's only a matter of time before the obligatory cat fight . That takes place about midway through , but you'll have to endure endless plodding narration at both ends before calling it a day . There are some interesting historical breakthroughs on display though . The male hero Engor ( Allan Nixon ) discovers fire , while his buddy Kama invents the barbecue , even if by accident . As goofy as it all looks , if you think about it , that very first piece of cooked meat had to get a start somewhere , so this is just as good a rationalization as any . Come to think of it , if the male tribe had a streak of cannibalism , old Guadi might have been on the menu when he became a crispy critter - yikes ! I'd be curious to find out how close this movie was to being the first done in color . Quite a few scenes look natural enough , but you'll have to muddle through a murky opening suggesting a soft porn ritual dance by the man-less women tribe . Then there are scenes that actually look like they're in black and white . For fans of family trees , the Smith and Jones equivalent of the dinosaur era must have been Engor . That was also the name of the main male tribesman in the 1958 flick , " Wild Women of Wongo " . That film also followed the exploits of love starved prehistoric women who set out to enslave male captives for the purpose of , well you know . Watching that film might also lead you to the same query as posited earlier , but at least WWoW had a campy flavor and didn't take itself as seriously as this one . Here however , the women used bolos and clubs to beat on the cave boys , so score one for Tigri and the girls . Nice outfits too !
368480	2707735	58953	4.0	" Don't you ' I love you ' me - What ? "	I could never get into the sun and surf films of the Sixties because frankly , they looked kind of dumb . However in the interest of maintaining a well rounded view of cinematic achievement , I caught this today on Turner Classic Movies . Boy , was it dumb . The host on TCM stated that each of the Frankie and Annette beach party movies were shot completely in a few hours , and then took about forty minutes to edit . It didn't sound like he was kidding about that , and judging by " Beach Blanket Bingo " , that formula is probably pretty close . In fact , I wouldn't be surprised if the film makers were working without a script too , because the situations and dialog at times appear to be completely at random , with no help from editing . For example , there's a scene where Bonehead ( Jody McCrae ) begins to pine after Lorelei ( Marta Kristen ) as she swims away in the moonlight , but instead of allowing the situation to build with emotion , the scene abruptly cuts to one of the skydiving sequences in bright daylight . It also would have helped if Dee Dee ( Annette Funicello ) and Frankie ( Frankie Avalon ) managed to stay in character from scene to scene . With Frankie scanning every babe to pass into view throughout the film , one minute Dee Dee is jealous , and the next the pair are lovey dovey . It doesn't help that Frankie epitomizes male chauvinism with his ' boys are different ' philosophy , as much as stating that Dee Dee should concentrate on staying in the kitchen instead of learning to sky dive . It would be hard to come up with the movie's low point , but the leading contenders have to include Rickels ' monologue when he tells Annette he never did like her anyway , and Zipper's ( Harvey Lembeck ) song lyric ' We'll give them the finger now " . For me personally , it would be South Dakota Slim's ( Timothy Carey ) trip to the ' booby shack ' , by that time I felt like Jack Nicholson after the lobotomy in ' Cuckoo's Nest ' . For my money , Slim is in the running for the most pathetic movie character ever . But hey , at least Linda Evans has that Lesley Gore thing going for her in a couple of singing numbers , which I would have bet were dubbed but weren't . And I did like the description of Von Zipper's ' Rats ' as Carbon Monoxide Commandos ; that was about the most thought put into this flick . But come on , you know you saw that ' fish out of water ' line coming from a mile away . I know I'm in the minority here based on some of the other posters for this film , but nostalgia only goes so far . When the final scene came down blessed by that ' Fin-ee ' , I could only scratch my head and repeat one of Frankie Avalon's lines from the picture - " You know , I just don't know " . Oh yeah , Buster Keaton is in the movie too , but I just don't believe it .
368447	2707735	25830	4.0	" More trouble , more fun . "	Lone Star Productions sure churned them out in the 1930's , and " Star Packer " has the feel of one of the more rushed ones . John Wayne is U . S . Marshal John Travers , investigating a crooked hoodlum known only as " The Shadow " , responsible for stealing cattle , stage holdups and the like , and giving orders from behind the door of a phony wall safe . Yakima Canutt is Travers ' trusty Indian sidekick , appropriately named as . . . well , " Yak " . Early on , we find out that Cattlemens Union head Matt Matlock ( George pre-Gabby Hayes ) is really The Shadow ; the dead giveaway is when he offers to buy out his ( supposed ) niece Anita's half of the Matlock Ranch , since " this is no place for a girl " . As Anita , Verna Hillie doesn't have much to do in the film , although in a comic moment , she gets to use a six shooter to blast the butt of one of the villains in a night time scare raid . There are a few curiosities in the film - for one , Wayne's character alternately rides a white horse and a dark horse in the first half of the film . In what could have been a neat device , a hollowed out tree stump used by a henchman is located right in the middle of the street . And finally , the movie doesn't truly live up to it's name , as Sheriff Travers never wears a badge throughout the film , that is , a star packer without a star . The horse chases , the runaway stage scenes , the stagecoach off the cliff ( another curiosity , the horses conveniently get loose from the stage ) are all pretty standard stuff . But John Wayne fans will want to see this one for the charisma he displayed early on in his career . For those more critical , the white kerchiefs worn around the forehead by the good guy posse could only mean that they all had a headache .
367607	2707735	35640	4.0	" Prepare yourself for a great shock Agatha . "	When Dr . James Brewster ( Bela Lugosi ) becomes a guinea pig for his own experiments , he turns himself into a medical marvel , at least that's the contention of his partner Dr . George Randall ( Henry Hall ) . The only thing the viewer will witness is an already bearded Lugosi affecting a stooped over walking pattern and unsure whether he should be swinging his arms or not . Lugosi's introduction on screen is somewhat puzzling in that he shares a cage in his laboratory with a man in a gorilla suit , but that's the only time we'll ever see him there . If there was a point to be made , it didn't work . Jeff Carter ( Wallace Ford ) and Billie Mason ( Louise Currie ) are a newspaper reporter and photographer respectively , hot on the trail of the Brewster mystery . Pay attention when they get into Carter's car for the first time to go to Brewster's residence , Billie calls him Mr . Brisbane . Screen pairings like this usually signal a romantic angle during the course of the story , but there's no chemistry here , which is just as well because they didn't look like the type for each other . Minerva Urecal is introduced into the story as Brewster's sister Agatha , with a reputation as a ghost hunter . Since that's referenced a number of times , one would think it had some bearing on the story , but once again we have a disconnect . Her mere presence though adds a spooky menace to the film and is one of it's redeeming factors . Hey , can you picture her as the ape man , er . . , ape woman ? With no fanfare and without warning , Brewster reveals the stunning basis for his cure rests in obtaining human spinal fluid and injecting it into his own spine . With his gorilla companion , Brewster heads out into broad daylight to line up his victims , but with the police department as inept as it is , he gets as much as he wants at will . Brewster's return to the human condition consists largely of standing up straight and repeatedly checking the mirror to see if his beard has gone away . Where's a Schick disposable when you need one ? If I sound like I'm being too harsh on the film , let me switch gears and say that it's a blast watching these Poverty Row efforts and wondering what movie patrons of the era thought of these films . For Lugosi , his was not a one gorilla film career . Other brushes with apedom included " The Gorilla " ( 1939 ) , and " Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla " ( 1952 ) . To pick a favorite from this trio is impossible . Lest I forget , not all the credit for this groaner belongs to the players . Director William Beaudine should at least get a share of the accolades for " The Ape Man " ; perhaps that's who Lugosi's character had in mind when early in the picture he states - " What a mess I've made of things " .
367614	2707735	27255	4.0	" Ace , you were cold decked by that gambler in Nevada , and he's deader now than my Aunt Emma's hopes of matrimony . "	As the film's title suggests , the famed aces and eights poker hand plays a role in the outcome of the story , but this time it's not a murder . Cowboy star Tim McCoy portrays Gentleman Tim Madigan , a card sharp who's not above a little bottom dealing himself . His reputation is so renowned that posters warn other gamblers to keep their distance from the well dressed poker player . Madigan's sidekick is a fellow named Lucky ( Jimmy Aubrey ) , who keeps a pair of dice handy to consider what the day will bring . They ride across the border to Roaring Gulch , California following the murder of a fellow gambler that's pinned on Madigan . Madigan doesn't wear a gun , relying on his wits and power ; he can tear a deck of cards into quarters . In Roaring Gulch he's befriended by Don Julio Hernandez ( Joseph Girard ) and his daughter Juanita ( Luana Walters ) , while her brother Jose mistakenly believes he's the one responsible for the murder back in Nevada . In an effort to save the Hernandez ranch from crooked saloon owner Amos Harden ( Frank Glendon ) , Madigan challenges him to a poker hand using a clean deck . Seems to me that was quite a gamble , even IF Lucky rolled a seven that day . Perhaps in the end it was Tim McCoy's steely gaze that saved the day , I've never seen it better . The Marshal ( Earl Hodgins ) tailing Madigan becomes convinced that he's innocent of the Nevada murder when Madigan pulls a slug out of a wall fired from Ace Morgan's ( Wheeler Oakman ) derringer . It matches up with the slug found near the dead body , in a logic defying exercise in ballistics , since the bullet had to go entirely through the dead man's body and then fall to his side . Not only that , but the Marshal had to find it ! I'd like to see the Warren Commission explain that one . At least one interesting custom is explained in the course of the story , though I don't know if there's any basis in fact for it . At the Hernandez ranch , a chalice of gold coins , ' La Copa D'Oro ' , is on display in one of the rooms . The custom says that the coins are for any guest who finds himself truly in need , and even a thief would not dishonor that generosity . Given the story line and the opportunities made available to tempt fate , the cup made it to the end of the tale untouched . That at least seemed a lot more credible than the exact same ' aces and eights ' poker hand showing up at different times in the story , to the point of matching the fifth card in the hand each time .
367745	2707735	44777	4.0	" . . . in the jungle , you're not always given a second chance . "	Gee , what would have possessed Jungle Jim ( Johnny Weissmuller ) to take on a hippo , and under water no less ? That's one of the offerings in ' The Forbidden Land ' , as the jungle hero aids an anthropologist seeking the fabled Land of Giant People . When a couple of the ' giants ' actually appear for the first time , my first thought was who might have raided Lon Chaney's Wolfman wardrobe . If you take all the Jungle Jim films together , this would have to be right up there with the goofiest , if not the most dangerous for Jim . He would actually have been a goner if not for chimp sidekick Tamba wielding a coconut bean ball when the male giant had him down for the count . For trivia fans , it's finally revealed here that Jim's home is near Ingaba Lake in the Wasabi District , even though most of his earlier stories took place in the Nagandi District . Or maybe he just moved . This film more than any of Weismuller's other Jungle Jim flicks looks like it was slapped together with as many elements as possible and as little coherence necessary to pull off the story . For example - ' The Old One ' , the wise old man of Tiku . In the scene establishing that he was blind , he fires off the film's cleverest line - " When eyes are dead , heart must see " . That advice was never needed again . The story itself involves ivory poachers , merely tall ' giant ' people , and Jim tackling the earlier mentioned hippo and a black panther . Oh yes , and he's injected with a truth serum to reveal the location of the giant homeland . It would be interesting to hear Weissmuller express his thoughts about the picture after being injected with truth serum . Keeping track of non African animals in an African setting ? This one has a South American jaguar battling a bush hog . As for that black panther , it's hilarious to watch it turn into a stuffed animal and back during it's wrestling match with Jim ; as always , no blood drawn against the intrepid jungle tracker . Second chances notwithstanding , Weissmuller tries to do as much as he can with the material he's given , but is shown to best advantage in his swimming and diving scenes . Not as trim as in his earlier Tarzan days , but still impressive enough . But can you really kill a hippo using just a knife ?
368151	2707735	52077	4.0	" My friends , we cannot keep this a secret any longer . . . "	OK , let's get this whole ' worst movie ever made ' business out of the way real quick - Plan 9 is NOT . Not when " Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet " , " The Incredible Petrified World " , and " She Gods of Shark Reef " all occupy a space on this planet . I've been giving this a lot of thought , and for my money , a movie can only be truly bad when you can't even find the wherewithal to make fun of it . On that score , Plan 9 succeeds wildly , and it's your loss if you miss an opportunity to see it . And you know something else , buried deep in the plot of the story is the germ of an idea that maybe Earthlings have gotten a little too big for their britches and have become a bit too dangerous to be part of the galaxy . Trouble is , the concept was done right eight years earlier in a masterpiece of sci-fi fiction - " The Day The Earth Stood Still " . So I guess that leaves the goofy stuff . Like when General Roberts ( Lyle Talbot ) explains to Colonel Edwards ( Tom Keene ) that the government's official position on flying saucers is that they don't exist . Yet earlier , we saw an Army Officer in charge of Saucer Field Artillery . It's the kind of oxymoronic thinking one would expect from military intelligence . You know , it was kind of curious to me that the female alien's name was Tanna , since Plan 9 had to deal with resurrecting the dead to take over the Earth . The entire series of Universal Studios ' ' Mummy " franchise dealt with the power of tana leaves to reanimate the title character . Coincidence ? - I wonder . My favorite line from the movie - Paula Trent ( Mona McKinnon ) to her pilot husband Jeff ( Gregory Walcott ) - " Now toddle off and fly your flying machine . . . " Speaking of the Trent's , where exactly did they live anyway ? When Bela Lugosi's stand-in comes calling in the middle of the night , she runs out of the house and is smack in the middle of a cemetery ! That's kind of creepy , don't you think ? The film though did give me something to ponder rather seriously . There's a line in the picture where someone states - " People who can think are so scared of people who cannot " ; he was talking about The Dead . If the film were made today , he'd be talking about politicians .
368161	2707735	38409	4.0	" I'd say she was contemplating a voyage . "	I strongly disapprove of a film where I have to rewind to understand what's going on , especially if the person I've just seen murdered shows up again in her bedroom writing in her diary . It's all part of a pill addled nightmare sequence experienced by Chuck Scott ( Robert Cummings ) , newly hired chauffeur to gangster Eddie Roman ( Steve Cochran ) . The basic plot has Roman's unhappy wife Lorna ( Michele Morgan ) convincing Scott to hustle her off to Cuba from Miami to escape an abusive marriage . This might have all worked out pretty well if the stuff that didn't happen actually happened , but instead , the stuff that really happens isn't nearly as interesting , making the stuff that's about to happen inconsequential . It's too bad too , because I was really getting into the characterizations of Cochran , Cummings , Morgan and Roman's henchman Gino , Peter Lorre in a menacing tease of a role that could have really scared up the heebie-jeebies . I especially enjoyed the conversation they shared regarding their occupation of choice being the amusement business , in it strictly for laughs . Too bad about the Napoleon brandy . Some of the more frustrated reviewers on this board complain about how confusing the story is , but if you follow it logically , it's not really . The point at which Chuck Scott realizes he's had a nightmare is clearly revealed , followed chronologically by events that lead to the finale . I guess the plus side of the movie allows for the ' Dallas ' style ending to play out right in the middle , but wasn't it just too convenient how Scott gets the girl ? Just how ' Love That Bob " might have done it .
368460	2707735	30972	4.0	" I never seen him before , but he can sure sling lead ! "	By the time " Whirlwind Horseman " came out , Ken Maynard was well past his prime as a major cowboy star , winding down his career with movies for Grand National and Colony Pictures . Here , Maynard wears one of the biggest good guy white hats going , as he tries to get to the bottom of a ' sudden burst of lawlessness ' with sidekick Happy ( Bill Griffith ) . Together they're also trying to locate a missing friend and old timer named Cherokee Jake ( Bud Buster ) , who's being kept hostage by the bad guys for the location of an oil discovery . The villains are terrorizing all the local ranchers until they can determine where the actual oil well is so they can turn in their own claim on it . The set up for this one is about as standard as they come and the effort is fairly unremarkable . The print I viewed was hampered by some of the darkened day time sequences that plague other Westerns of the era that are somewhat annoying if you haven't seen it before and gotten accustomed to it . There's also the frequent pauses in dialog between characters as if waiting for a cue or for something significant to happen . Maynard himself is involved in his share of those and you find yourself wondering what everyone is waiting around for . There's one bit of action that stands out , and that's when Sheriff Ken Morton ( Maynard ) runs a rope across the trail and trips up four horses and riders from the bad guy posse . If you stop to think about it though , there's no way you can believe that one guy can trip up four charging horses with his bare hands ( even with gloves on ) like that . It's another example of trip wires in use before the PETA folks got involved against cruelty to animals . All the horse got up from this one , but it couldn't have been fun . The most recognizable baddie in the flick is perennial ' B ' oater stand-by , Glenn Strange . I like to think that between him and Stanley Andrews , they appeared in just about every Western ever made in the early days . You watch any classic TV or movie Western prior to the mid 1960's and you'll probably see one or the other , and that's a good thing . You know , the ' Whirlwind Horseman ' wouldn't have been as much without a whirlwind horse . Maynard's light colored palomino was named Tarzan , and watching them gallop across the screen together was one of the thrills of their pictures . Tarzan has some good presence in this flick , even if you never hear his name mentioned .

"	Dead Man's Gulch is the locale for this Marx Brothers western spoof , and whoever holds the deed to the town at the end of the show is a rich man . As you can imagine , the deed itself is up for grabs , and changes hands any number of times before the grand finale . Groucho is S . Quentin Quale , in turn hoodwinked and aided by brothers Joe and Rusty Panello ( Chico and Harpo ) . As usual , Groucho woos the ladies - " Lulubelle , it's you , I didn't recognize you standing up " ! . Harpo is also in fine form , playing harmonica on horseback , and serenading an Indian camp with a makeshift harp . The frenetic pace is just enough to keep you off kilter and entertained at the same time . It's all silly fun of course , and by the time the film ends , the outcome of the deed doesn't even matter . So head on over to the Crystal Palace , and " Go West " .
367747	2707735	54428	5.0	" You run from the truth . "	If as I've read , that director John Huston didn't like this movie , it's totally understandable . I'm more curious as to why he might have taken on the project given the inconsistent elements in so many parts of the story and characters . Perhaps he felt he could have melded these issues into a coherent picture , but if so , it was undone by the film's editing after he left the set . Examples abound , beginning with the Zachary family at the center of the story . Early on , we come to understand that the Zachary brothers are returning home from Wichita to their mother and sister . Later on , in a scene with Ben ( Burt Lancaster ) and Rachel ( Audrey Hepburn ) on horseback , talk turns to the possibility of romance , with Ben mentioning that they are not even related . It's all revealed later of course , but wasn't it just a bit creepy that two people raised as brother and sister would suddenly begin to see each other in romantic terms ? That premise managed to keep me off balance for much of the rest of the movie . I also had difficulty with the central characters making one hundred eighty degree reversals in nature and temperament . Ben starts out as a noble character , willing to hire an Indian ( John Saxon as Portugal ) because of his skill with horses , even defending him against the racist local ranchers . Later though , he has no problem ordering brother Andy ( Doug McClure ) to kill an Indian under a flag of truce . Similarly , when Rachel learns of her heritage , she's willing to go off with the Kiowa camp , but has no difficulty taking up arms to shoot them when the family home comes under siege . Audie Murphy's character as brother Cash is possibly the most extreme ; having been raised with Rachel as his sister , he doesn't even need one second to renounce her as a ' dirty Injun ' , demanding that Ben send her away . In all of these examples , there wasn't even a hint of any of the characters being conflicted about their decisions , they just managed to turn on a dime as the story called for . As for Johnny Portugal , what ever happened to him ? He seemed to be set up for a role in the outcome , possibly as a rival for Ben , but that never materialized . Before knowing that the film's basis was Alan LeMay's novel , I found myself mentally comparing it in some respects to John Ford's " The Searchers " , starring John Wayne . Interestingly , that was also based on a LeMay book . In that movie as well , I couldn't understand why Wayne's character wanted to find his niece to kill her , having been kidnapped by Comanches , and unable to escape through no fault of her own . The harsh aspects of racism that underlie the themes of both stories are strong enough to make one focus on birthright and family relationships , so on that score , both have some value . Comparing the two , " The Searchers " is the stronger film . The one thing I haven't seen anyone comment on in this forum though , are the shocking terms spoken in the movie in an era before political correctness became the norm . When Hagar Rawlins ( June Walker ) unleashes on Rachel as ' red ni - - er as ever was ' , it was a genuine sit up and take notice moment in the story . The phrase ' red hide ni - - er ' was also used later on , again in an entirely inflammatory context , the only time I've ever heard the term used in film to this point . On a final note , I agree somewhat with other reviewers who feel Audrey Hepburn was miscast as an Indian . However , for a Plains settler , I found it a bit ironic that when Burt Lancaster went for a swim , he was as white as if he had never been out in the sun with his shirt off . Not too convincing for a Western hero .
368015	2707735	28231	5.0	" Somehow I don't like murders at close quarters as much as I expected . . . "	First off , I'll state that I enjoyed " Secret Agent " , however on reflection , the story doesn't hold up realistically as the espionage drama it sets out to be . Not that it couldn't have been , it's just that the story development overlooked some important considerations . The main one is the integrity of Madeleine Carroll's character , Elsa Carrington . Presumably , Elsa is an agent assigned to assist novelist / aviator Edgar Brodie ( John Gielgud ) in his new identity , that of Richard Ashenden . When the going gets tough after she gets romantically involved with Ashenden , she's ready to ditch him and seek escape in the company of their known target , a German courier named Robert Marvin ( Robert Young ) . Had the British government known how wishy washy she was , would she have ever been given such an important mission ? Come to think of it , how did she even become a spy ? And how does Ashenden decide he's simply going to quit the mission after the wrong man is killed ? Fortunately that didn't have to be answered , because he was back on the case quicker than a commercial break . There are some other elements that stretch credibility also . While I can accept an intangible connection between a man and his pet , I found Caypor's dachshund to be absolutely psychic , so tuned in was he to his master's unfortunate death . On balance though , the film is somewhat redeemed by an amazingly adept performance by Young's character as he attempts to woo Elsa , even though her cover was as wife of Ashenden . Director Hitchcock's reliance on humor was served well by their steady comedic banter which had a genuine naturalness to it . I won't get into Peter Lorre's characterization as the hairless Mexican , as even the film admits coming up short on that one . Lorre is gleefully crazed as he pounds walls with his fist and attacks a roll of toilet paper , which by the way , wasn't exactly in a bathroom , was it ? I don't quite know what to make of the climactic closing sequence . With Elsa once again changing stride in midstream , the British agents confront their quarry in a confined railroad car , the rest of the train brimming with German military . As English planes commence a bombing run and destroy the tracks , the train collides in a heap , leaving the four principals dazed in their compartment . As they all slowly come to , The General ( Lorre ) sets his handgun in front of the German agent , presumably to elicit his own suicide in a hopeless situation . Bad move , he uses it on The General . It reminded me of an earlier quote uttered by both Ashenden and The General in unison - " He hasn't got a copy of the rules " .
368363	2707735	21861	5.0	" I understand Indians ain't got no use for blondes , no way . "	The Gary Cooper of " Fighting Caravans " is certainly not the Gary Cooper of " High Noon " , nor is his future star quality evident here . In this film , Cooper is as green and naive as the Clint Belmet character he portrays . To avoid arrest on a trumped up charge , he poses as an intended groom for French lovely Felice ( Lily Damita ) , who is intent on finding passage to California on a wagon train from Independence , Missouri to Sacramento . Clint has been trained in the ways of frontier life by two grizzled veterans , Bridger and Jackson , and they don't exactly cotton to the budding romance they see unfolding - " Here's hopin ' she finds a husband somewhere's else " . Based on a Zane Grey novel and set right in the middle of the Civil War , the film moves unevenly from it's unlikely premise , to a temporary stop at an Army fort while it's troop marches on to Vicksburg to hook up with General Grant , and throughout it's dangerous journey in the middle of hostile Indian territory . Cooper proves his worth along the way and finally wins his lady's heart by rescuing her from a runaway wagon . See it both for Gary Cooper's early starring performance and for it's early Western treatment in the relatively new " talkie " format , but don't expect an epic .
367649	2707735	39419	5.0	" You don't have anything to worry about anyhow , ghosts don't start walkin ' around till midnight . "	Chalk one up for " Ghost Town Renegades " , here's a " B " Western with a title that actually has something to do with the story . It takes place in the abandoned old mining town of Waterhole , Arizona , where a newly discovered vein may prove profitable once again . Holders of deeds to property in Waterhole are contacted by chief bad guy Vance Sharp ( Jack Ingram ) with an offer to purchase their worthless land , but they never seem to make it out of town alive . Sharp's henchmen make them disappear whether they cooperate or not . Enter Cheyenne Davis ( Lash LaRue ) , sent to sort things out by the territorial chief marshal . When given the lowdown by Marshal Jennings ( Henry Hall ) , Cheyenne asks if he should investigate as the law or as the Cheyenne Kid ; the Marshal states that a little bit of both would do . Chey's old partner Fuzzy ( Fuzzy St . John ) is already on the case , going undercover as it were , and posing as a prospector . Lash LaRue gets to use his trademark bull whip a few times in this oater , but it's Fuzzy who seems to get the quality time in this picture . He certainly gets to use his acrobatic skills , head butting bad guys and doing a few headstands at the expense of Sharp's henchmen . He's even featured in a couple of bits at an abandoned mining cabin , trying to make a grab of his " haunted " hat , and doing some double takes at the meanest hombre he ever saw while looking in a mirror . Handling the female chores in this one is a pretty Jennifer Holt , one of the deeded landowners in Waterhole , who falls in with Cheyenne after being duped once by Sharp . Jennifer appeared in a number of LaRue's Westerns , including " The Fighting Vigilantes " and " Stage to Mesa City " . Sometimes credited as Jacqueline Holt , she's the sister of cowboy actor Tim Holt , and daughter of Jack Holt . Good guys and bad guys trade the upper hand a few times in this flick , but in the end , Lash and Fuzzy come out on top after exposing the crooked Sharp and his accomplice at the assay office , Jonas Watson ( William Fawcett ) . It's a fairly quick paced shoot ' em up that comes in at just about an hour . One thing to note about the shooting scenes , watch as the bad guys shoot the stage driver from behind , he doubles over as if hit from the front . It happens twice in this picture . The other thought that occurred to me - if you shave off Fuzzy's beard and sideburns , could it be that under all that hair is Popeye the Sailor Man ?
367671	2707735	28670	5.0	" Take it easy , you want this stuff to blow up ? "	The Bulldog Drummond franchise was a busy one with nine films in the three years from 1937 to 1939 . They generally followed a thematic line , one of those being the theft of a newly invented device that might prove useful to enemy hands . In " Bulldog Drummond's Revenge " , the gizmo in question is an explosive powder called ' haxonite ' , presumably named after it's inventor Sir Hohn Haxton ( Matthew Boulton ) . The powder is rather tricky and unpredictable , but it's theorized that enough of the crystals could blow London to bits . In very quick order , Haxton's traitorous butler Draven Nogais ( Frank Puglia ) murders the inventor aboard a plane flight , and parachutes himself and the device away from the doomed airplane . The coincidences necessary to make the film proceed are extraordinary , as Drummond and his sidekicks Algy and Tenny ( Reginald Denny , E . E . Clive ) recover the suitcase with the explosives , which conveniently falls on the road they're traveling . Back at Rockingham Lodge , the suitcase in turn is stolen by the bad guys during the old lights out trick , prompting a London to Dover escapade that have the heroes and villains trading the advantage before Drummond's team makes the save for Scotland Yard . As ever , Drummond's fiancée Phyllis Clavering ( Louise Campbell ) is left to wonder whether the wedding will ever take place , as it's constantly being interrupted by some nefarious plot or another . This time around , Miss Clavering receives consolation from Algy's wife Gwen ( Nydia Westman ) , the first time Mrs . Longworth is introduced into the filmography . The movie gets some mileage out of a rather gruesome plot device , a severed hand from Sir Haxton's plane crash . The girls do a double faint when the hand is revealed in the commotion at Rockingham when the suitcase is stolen . Rounding out the cast is John Barrymore as Colonel Nielson of Scotland Yard ; he once again gets top billing over John Howard's Drummond , as he did in their prior film " Bulldog Drummond Comes Back " . Barrymore's manner is sophisticated and professional , unlike the roles assigned to the lead authority in films of the Charlie Chan and Mr . Wong series of the same era . The comic relief as it were is left to Algy for the physical slapstick , and Tenny for the cerebral . Tenny's best deadpan line occurs early when Drummond comments on how much fun getting married ought to be ; the response - " It's a popular belief Sir . " With the case solved and the explosive powder back in safekeeping , the anticipated Drummond / Clavering wedding plans seem to be on track to survive some more adventures , and it will take a few more films to get there . There does seem to be some semblance of continuity to the development of the characters , so watching the series in the order of release is helpful to keep track of things . The movies offer a nice balance of mystery and comedy and thankfully don't take themselves too seriously .
368282	2707735	28667	5.0	" Confound it Drummond , how is it that whenever I see you someone has either been murdered or disappeared . "	In this entry in the Bulldog Drummond franchise , the Captain ( John Howard ) finds himself on the trail of a pair of villains who have kidnapped his fiancée Phyllis Clavering ( Louise Campbell ) . What makes the story interesting are the written and audible clues that Irena Soldanis ( Helen Freeman ) and her brother-in-law Mikhail Valdin ( J . Carrol Naish ) leave for the detective . The motive behind the kidnapping hearkens back to a murder trial that sent Irena's husband to the gallows , courtesy of Drummond . " Bulldog Drummond Comes Back " seems to be a follow up to the same year's " Bulldog Drummond Escapes " . In that film , the running gag had Drummond's sidekick Algy ( Reginald Denny ) fretting over the birth of his first son ; this time out , Algy is worried about making the christening . Scotland Yard's Colonel Neilson is portrayed by the venerable John Barrymore this time around , and as befits his reputation , is actually top billed above the film's lead character . He earns it though , with a repertoire of disguises necessitated by the villains ' threat to kill Miss Clavering if Scotland Yard gets involved . But in this , my third viewing of a Bulldog Drummond movie , the scene stealer is once again Drummond's butler Tenny ( E . E . Clive ) , who's deadpan repartee and mannerisms make for beautifully understated comic relief . He's also a bit more adventurous this time out , inviting himself along as Drummond and Algy take after the bad guys . It's interesting to note that it was Tenny who figured out one of the clues to be the old disappearing ink trick . Note the scene in which Tenny hitches a ride on the back of the car which shanghais Drummond outside the Anglers Rest . Tenny looks into the rear window of the vehicle , and clearly visible inside is the back of a person's head . However inside the auto , Miss Soldanis and the kidnapped Miss Clavering are in the back seat , but with a shade pulled down over the window ! I've seen J . Carrol Naish now in a number of films , and he looks different every time out . Here , as the creepy villain Valdin he looks almost Oriental in appearance , in a characterization that would have done Peter Lorre proud . Before the mystery is over , Drummond , Algy and Phyllis must escape a death trap before succumbing to lethal gas . Ever the enterprising butler , Tenny makes use of a Scotland Yard auto to remove a fallen tree from the road and arrive just in time to make the save . One thing though , can you really shoot the pin out of a door hinge with a handgun ? If you can overlook some of the less plausible elements in this and other films in the Drummond series , they're worth the effort in entertainment value . I'm still waiting though to see if Captain Drummond ever winds up at the altar ; in both " Escapes " and " Comes Back " he winds up still single at the end of the film .
368387	2707735	22470	5.0	" Charity . . . , for a drunkard's family ! "	Not what I expected from a movie titled " Ten Nights In a Barroom " , particularly since it was packaged with a variety of anti-drug propaganda films from the 1930's like " The Marijuana Menace " and " Reefer Madness " . This one played more like a melodramatic morality play at one end , and as another reviewer on this board pointed out , like a standard ' B ' Western from the era wherein the main character was duped by an unscrupulous villain to take away his business and livelihood . For a very early talkie film , it deserves some credit for a gripping story , but upon analysis , falls victim to a number of problems to the discerning viewer . For starters , there was an issue with the film's continuity relative to Joe Morgan's ( William Farnum ) sick young daughter Mary ( Peggy Lou Lind ) . Early in the story , Dr . Romaine's diagnosis allowed for Mary to get over her illness with bed rest after a couple of days . Yet after six months , Mary's still in bed with no further explanation of her ailment , and that drags on until another title card states it's one year later ! The young actress portraying Mary does a serious heart string number when she encounters her father in the bar for the first time , but then the picture goes on to attempt the scenario again when the initial impact provided the pathos needed to engage the viewer in her family's plight . At that time , the effectiveness of the scene was measured in the follow up where all the family men of the town stopped their drinking to go home to their families . Where the film achieves a measure of success is the way it keeps one in suspense about villain Slade's ( Tom Santschi ) angle in leading Morgan down the path of the demon rum . It was easy enough to guess I suppose , but it wasn't clear early in the picture that Morgan was a man of some means , or that his family history was scourged by alcoholism . It's that unveiling that makes for an absorbing story , even if some of the acting has that forced look and feel of early talking pictures that tended to lay it all out for the viewer instead of allowing for one to use their own imagination .
368060	2707735	37433	5.0	" I know what happens when you're in a peaceable mood . "	One thing about these old " B " Westerns - the title often had nothing to do with the actual story . Case in point , " Vigilantes of Dodge City " was not a story about vigilantes as one commonly envisions when hearing the term . This film is one of a number of Red Ryder Westerns , the series of films that starred either Allan " Rocky " Lane or Wild Bill Elliott as the title character . The supporting cast generally included Alice Fleming as the Duchess , Red Ryder's aunt who raised him , and trusted young Indian friend Little Beaver . Beaver was portrayed by present day accused wife killer Robert " Baretta " Blake , then credited as Bobby Blake , and sporting a remarkable resemblance to the grown actor . Bill Elliott does the honors as Red Ryder here , and besides helping out with the Dutchess ' Ryder Freight Lines , he raises horses for the Army . Crooked banker Luther Jennings ( LeRoy Mason ) and cohort Bishop ( Wally Wales / Hal Talafiero ) scheme to set up Red with not only robbing the Ryder Freight Lines , but also of defrauding the government by rustling his own horses . Little Beaver plays a key role in this story , when he discovers a hidden cave that serves as headquarters for Jennings and his henchmen . As a fan of these old Westerns , I find it interesting how different cowboy stars handled their six-shooters . Bill Elliott , in the heat of a good showdown , seems to " throw " his gun in the direction of his target as he fires , as if adding emphasis to his action . If you enjoy this film , try some more Elliott Red Ryders , well over a dozen in all , including Sun Valley Cyclone and Sheriff of Redwood Valley . For a different yet similar take on the Ryder character , try Rocky Lane's Rustlers of Devil's Canyon or Marshal of Cripple Creek . All are from the mid 1940's , with the Elliott films preceding the Lane versions . For fans of the early Republic Serials , one of the better ones is The Adventures of Red Ryder from 1940 , starring Don " Red " Barry as the title character . Have fun !
368027	2707735	20305	5.0	" Is the Rat in from Chicago ? "	While watching the movie , it struck me that this might be the closest I've seen to a silent film actually put to dialog , the execution of which seems like actors from a high school play who simply studied their lines and recited them from memory . We know that the principal players were much better than that from their later work , so take it as part of the learning curve in going from silents to talkies . Add to that a bit of overacting , a prime example being the conversation between Mal ( Robert Armstrong ) , Gus ( Kit Guard ) and Squid ( Al Hill ) when discussing Weber's murder . Armstrong does such a quick double take that it's comical , I caught myself in a knee jerk reaction laughing over the way the trio handled that scene . The story itself takes a while to unfold , and you don't get a sense of where things are going until well into the picture . Once you get there though , it turns out to be a fairly interesting ride , as Rhoda Philbrooke ( Carol Lombard ) finds her affections torn between gangster Mahlon Keane ( Armstrong ) and alcoholic musician Tony Vaughan ( Roland Drew ) . I thought the poker scene in which Mal covers for Rhoda's dishonesty was cleverly done , initiating the relationship between the two . So let's see , a cab ride in New York City in 1929 for sixty five cents - not a bad bargain . Combine that with a letter that could be simply addressed using a person's name and the town in which he lives ( Mahlon Keane , Roslyn , Long Island ) , and I find myself longing for those good old days . Rhoda's fox fur was a bit much though , don't you think ? All in all , not a bad little entry on the sixteen disc " Mobsters " DVD set from Platinum Disc , this being one of the earliest of the films chronologically . Perhaps better viewed as a curiosity piece than for it's story , it's a fine example of an early talkie that gives one a good idea how the transition from silents was accomplished .
367568	2707735	39800	5.0	" Who can ever be sure what's behind a mask ? "	You would think that teaming Bela Lugosi and George Zucco together would guarantee a moody creep fest , but " Scared to Death " is all over the place with references to green masks and Nazis , and a central character who's dead and telling the story in flashback . The flick adds character after character , presumably to keep things interesting , which might not have been as distracting if done in black and white . There's a lot crammed into this tale , and in the end , it's difficult to say whether it serves as mystery , horror or comedy . For what it's worth , the dead narrator Laura LaValle ( Molly Lamont ) was a singer in Paris who married Ward Van Ee on a bet , and now believes herself to be trapped against her will in the Van Ee ( great name ! ) home by her husband ( Roland Varno ) and father in law ( Zucco ) . She won't consent to a divorce , and at every turn smells conspiracy to do away with her . The first appearance of Lugosi and midget sidekick Angelo Rossitto brought an unintentional chuckle to this viewer , their disparate pairing a particularly weird element of the movie . In fact , the diminutive Indigo doesn't do much but posture and skulk around furtively until he eventually disappears from sight without explanation later on . Perhaps he figured out he was in over ( under ? ) his head in this one . Nat Pendleton portrays a lug of a private patrol officer and body guard for Zucco's character ; he's got a thing for maid Lilly Beth ( Gladys Blake ) , so their presence has some basis for being around , but why did the reporter and his girl friend show up ? Nothing had actually happened yet by the time of their arrival , so Terry Lee's ( Douglas Fowley ) nose for news was working overtime for nothing . Though the revelation of the ' killer ' doesn't come totally out of left field , I'll have to admit some confusion over the whole floating blue mask gimmick . It appeared a few times with Lugosi's character on screen , but why was Leonide out in the garden mimicking the same apparition ? Like a lot of what goes on in the picture , it's another diversion that winds up without servicing the story . In the finale , we're left to consider that Laura literally dropped dead away at the ' horror ' of her ' dead ' first husband showing up to give meaning to the story's title . It's a bit of a stretch , but by this time one's left wondering what isn't . There's only one thing I'd be willing to bet on here , the best performance in the entire film had to go to the put upon maid Lilly Beth . Throughout her entire presence in a ' deep hypnotic trance ' , try as you might , you won't catch her with anything but a straight face . For this film , it's the mark of a consummate actress .
368257	2707735	38234	5.0	" Sounds like that long legged nephew of mine has cut loose again , proving what a peaceable man he is . "	All the Wild Bill Elliott Red Ryder films have that story book opening where he steps out from behind the cover of a dime novel , gun drawn and ready for action . With this one , Little Beaver ( Bobby Blake ) steps out with him in a neat introduction to the story . The other regular on hand is Red's Aunt , the Duchess ( Alice Fleming ) , though I can't recall her being referred to by that name this time out . " Wagon Wheels Westward " plays out as a fairly standard and formulaic story , with Red and company tackling a villainous gang attempting to loot the members of a wagon train load of settlers heading for Desert Springs . When they get there , it looks like " Deserted Springs " - not a soul in sight . The mystery is resolved by the end of the film , it seems that gold fever stampeded everyone out of town ! The bad guys , headed by Dave McKean ( Roy Barcroft ) posing as land agent John Larkin , attempt to get the drop on the settlers by issuing fake deeds in return for their cash . Naturally they intend to high tail it once they loot the settlers , but Red Ryder smells something fishy and gets busy smoking out the bad guys . The film offers the expected shootout between both sides , and it's the only time in any Western when I heard one of the bad guys complain about wasting ammunition . That was before the quick thinking Little Beaver dropped a pair of bricks on a couple of the baddies knocking them out ; his bow and arrow must have been out of commission . I always get a kick out of seeing young Bobby Blake , whether in the old " Our Gang " series , or backing up the Rocky Lane or Bill Elliot Red Ryder's . Even back then he bore a strong resemblance to the adult Robert Blake of " Baretta " and more recently the celebrated murder trial . Little Beaver's favorite response to a Red Ryder request - " You betchum " ! Wild Bill Elliott has a rather large list of film credits with over two hundred films , which included sixteen Red Ryder movies . He also got a lot of mileage out of portraying Wild Bill Hickok in a number of films , and even appeared under his own name in 1943's " Calling Wild Bill Elliott " . Pretty amazing actually , if you consider if it were done today , we might have something like " Sylvester Stallone : First Blood " .
368366	2707735	40347	5.0	" Only children and fools open their mouths when they have nothing to say . "	" The Feathered Serpent " is unique among Charlie Chan films for a number of reasons . For one , we learn the identity of the master criminal well before the movie's end . Professor John Stanley ( Robert Livingston ) has kidnapped colleague Henry Farnsworth to learn the location of an ancient Aztec treasure . Only Farnsworth can decipher the Aztec hieroglyphics that may reveal the location of the riches . Perhaps even more meaningful for fans of the Chan series , Keye Luke has returned after an eleven year absence to reprise his role as Number # 1 Son Lee . The last time Luke appeared in a Chan film was in 1937's " Charlie Chan at Monte Carlo " , then with Warner Oland in the title role ; he had never appeared in a Sidney Toler Chan film . On top of that , this is the only pairing of Keye Luke with Victor Sen Yung , who again appears as Number # 2 Son Tommy ( although he was Number # 2 Son Jimmy in all the Sidney Toler Chan films in which he worked ) . The movie takes it's name from the ancient Aztec practice of worshiping a feathered snake or serpent . It's a bit difficult getting used to Roland Winters ' speech pattern as the Chinese detective in this film , it seems a bit more exaggerated than in his earlier pictures . And I can't imagine why the film makers chose to have Chan run around the Mexican wilderness in his trademark white suit and hat , when a safari suit would have made a lot more sense . The end of the movie plays a lot more like an Abbott and Costello film than a Charlie Chan picture . There's a lot of animated fighting and the Chan brothers actually get a bit violent in pummeling the bad guys , particularly Tommy who repeatedly pounds his opponents ' head against a stone step inside the discovered temple ; it's actually quite gruesome if you analyze what's going on . But probably the most off kilter moment comes when Charlie himself warns his party to be careful in handling a weapon intended for himself - " Poison dart probably dipped in poison " .
368047	2707735	42311	5.0	" Speak or you die , where is She-Devil ? "	If you watch enough of the Jungle Jim movies , you'll realize that the stories all follow a pretty standard formula , just as Charles Starrett's Durango Kid films did in the Western genre . Which is OK on the one hand because they're entertaining in their way , but it also makes them highly forgettable once a couple of days have passed by . What's kind of interesting in this one is that Johnny Weismuller as the jungle hero is pitted against Buster Crabbe as the villain of the piece . Since both were genuine Olympic swimming champions , the stage might have been set for some sort of athletic rivalry , however since it was Weismuller's franchise , he's the only one we see doing the high dives and underwater heroics , this time against a crocodile . Central to the story is the rumored Wild Girl of Lake Pakongee , raised in the jungle and accompanied by a tiger . Her parents were murdered years earlier by the evil witch doctor Hakim , and it's Hakim's goal to kill her as well , before she can exact revenge . Interestingly , the actress portraying the Wild Girl , Anita Lhoest , appeared on screen only one time , and this was it . She too was an exceptional swimmer from California . As in all the Jungle Jim films , wild animals take center stage from time to time , but with budgets as they were back in the day , it's not too hard to pick out that monkey treetop scramble that appeared as stock footage in the prior two films ( " The Lost Tribe " and " Mark Of The Gorilla " ) . What makes this picture fun at the finale is the wild monkey rampage that overtakes the witch doctor and his tribal goons . For those keeping track , the non African animal appearing in the story this time , besides Wild Girl Joan's tiger , is a South American cockatoo . Say , if you stay attentive , there are a couple of interesting items to stay alert for . Right after Chief Mahala ( Rick Vallin ) banishes Hakim from the tribal village , there's a shot of Wild Girl up on a rock ledge , just as in the start of the picture . If you look closely , you'll note that the waterfall to her left is in reverse , it's rising instead of falling ! Later on in the story , listen closely and you'll hear a faint Tarzan yell during the panther / tiger scuffle . That was Weismuller's classic signature that he invented for his earlier Tarzan role . For me , I guess that's where the fun is in these Jungle Jim pictures , trying to pick up on the little idiosyncrasies thrown in by the director to make things interesting . Moving forward , we'll have to see if Tamba the Chimp becomes a regular as one of Jungle Jim's animal companions . He made fast friends with Jim's dog Skipper by trading a bone for a banana in the early filler part of the movie . Good thing too , or Jim and company would have never made it across the ravine !
368542	2707735	31125	5.0	" On my record darling , you're justified in expecting battle , murder and sudden death . "	The long playing wedding scenario between Captain Hugh Drummond ( John Howard ) and fiancé Phyllis Clavering ( Heather Angel ) manages to get within one hour of the ceremony in this outing , but not before another adventure gets in the way . This time the action stays local , as a scatterbrained professor intrigues Drummond with a tale of treasure hidden somewhere at his palatial Rockingham Tower . A long shot of the Tower reveals a rather imposing structure , made to order for the creepy fun that's about to follow . In the early going , Miss Clavering's Aunt Blanche makes it a point to remind Phyllis of the five previous failed attempts to make it to the altar . Obviously this had an impact on Drummond , as he relives those events in a dream sequence , unable to get a good night's sleep on the eve of his wedding . With the prospect of a million pound fortune somewhere close by , it's a safe bet that the marriage will be put on hold once again . This time , the villain of the piece is Leo ( minus the ' G ' ) Carroll . He impersonates a butler named Boulton hired for the wedding occasion , but is really Henry Seton , arrested three years earlier for the attempted theft of papers held by Professor Downie ( Forrester Harvey ) . Just released from prison , Seton's timing is perfect . He dispatches Downie and begins to solve the cipher that leads to the treasure . For all the mystery involving the cipher , it comes as a bit of a letdown that it simply involves a reverse alphabet . The hunt for the treasure leads Seton and his unwilling captive Miss Clavering into an underground series of murky caverns beneath Rockingham Tower . Harry Potter would have been inspired by what he found there , the secretive ' Tower of Water ' and ' Chamber of Spikes ' . With Drummond and Company in hot pursuit , the hapless villain manages to discover the hidden treasure only to lose it just as quickly . Seton becomes distracted in a rather inept cat and mouse game with Miss Clavering over control of a lever that operates a trap door gate meant to keep Drummond's gang at bay . As usual , Captain Hugh Drummond finds himself aided by his regular cast ; Reginald Denny , E . E . Clive and H . B . Warner in the role of Colonel Nielson of Scotland Yard . If you've seen all the Drummond adventures up till now , you'll wonder if Nielson has anything else to do besides serving as Drummond's personal attaché . At least Nielson provides the rationale for the movie's title when Drummond assigns areas of Rockingham to his accomplices for inspection ; it was then that the Colonel referred to themselves as the ' secret police ' . For at least the third time in a Bulldog Drummond film , the old lights out trick is used when Seton / Boulton attempts to get his hands on the diary containing the cryptic cipher . That lack of originality and the aforementioned clumsiness in dealing with Miss Clavering seemed to undermine his threat as a villain . Too bad he couldn't swim either . Too bad also the way the film ended ; for all the time spent pining for her long delayed wedding , it's Miss Clavering who disappears this time when Algy's Molotov cocktail explodes during the wedding rehearsal , compliments of a rigged bottle of Mountain Mary Scotch . The finale didn't make much sense except to justify one more sequel . I wonder what happens in " Bulldog Drummond's Bride " !
368465	2707735	33144	6.0	" Listen , you see things those white boys don't see . . . "	The East Side Kids films would often use the boxing ring as the focus of their stories , but the sport dealt with here is horse racing , as Muggs Maloney ( Leo Gorcey ) fancies himself a championship rider . When an itinerant black trainer and his horse find temporary shelter at the abandoned Acme Stable , Muggs and his gang befriend the old gentleman and start getting Blue Knight ready for a successful payday . Muggs however is a tenuous rider , and is seen as a drawback for Blue Knight's success . The story gets some mileage out of Muggs defending himself against ' back out ' talk from the horse's financial backers , as well as East Sider Danny ( Bobby Jordan ) . He even gets to mix it up with one of his racing idols , Jimmy Sullivan ( Nick Wall ) , before it finally sinks in that maybe it's the right thing to do . That's where the story gets interesting for me . The East Side Kids films and others of the era , like the Charlie Chan series , often used black characters for comic relief and as denigrating stereotypes . This one though , contains two unique scenes that seem to be an attempt to address the stereotype and convey sympathy for the black character . The first is when Scruno ( Sunshine Sammy Morrison ) and Ben ( Clarence Muse ) discuss what they see as fear in Muggs ' behavior when riding Blue Knight . Scruno's observation is dead on , and Ben answers with the comment in my summary above ; to me it was taken as an insightful observation by someone who had known fear himself . The other scene comes across more forcefully , and looked like it might have been groundbreaking for it's time . When Ben himself questions Muggs about riding to win , Muggs ' anger surfaces and he slaps the black man in the face . White teenage aggression slaps down the uppity Negro . It was an awkward moment , and it left me wondering how the scene might have played for it's audience of the time . Immediately after , realizing what he's done , Muggs challenges Ben to fight back and beat him ; not so much to defend himself , but to beat the fear out of Muggs , who now realizes it for himself . Later , a redemptive moment occurs when Muggs saves Ben from a fire , and the two embrace in friendship , realizing that they really needed each other all along . All that said , it's notable to mention I've seen Clarence Muse in only two other films , 1936's " Daniel Boone " and 1941's " Invisible Ghost " . However in both pictures , his subservient role is handled respectfully and with dignity . The thought just occurred that he might have been the Morgan Freeman of his era . Of course , as all the East Side Kids stories do , this one ends on a successful note , with Blue Knight winning the big race finale in a photo finish . Muggs isn't part of that decision , but he doesn't have to be . It's a classy ending where making a tough decision winds up being the right one for everyone to come out a winner .
367838	2707735	47795	6.0	" I shot the body three times and the head twice . "	The mystery here is the names attributed to Abbott and Costello in the closing credits as Peter Patterson and Freddie Franklin . They repeatedly refer to each other by their real names in the film , and I can't recall their character references in the movie at all . Universal rounds out the boys ' monster pairings one last time with The Mummy , after previous and better team ups with Frankenstein , The Invisible Man and Jekyll & Hyde . Marie Winsdsor appears as the evil Madame Rontru , leader of a gang attempting to acquire the sacred medallion of the Mummy Klaris . Besides the boys , her nemesis in the movie is Richard Deacon's character Semu , an Egyptology student who wants to save the treasure of Princess Ara for the true believers of Klaris . His first appearance is rather ridiculous , dressed as he is in an Egyptian costume , though he trades it in for better suited business attire later in the film . The Klaris name is a knockoff of the Kharis Mummy portrayed in the original 1932 film by Boris Karloff . For their part , the boys get some mileage out of gags with the dead body of Dr . Gustav Zoomer ( Karl Katch ) , an expected dancing cobra and a take your pick and shovel routine . But a one is good , three is better attempt at providing a trio of mummies falls a bit flat , with Bud and a Windsor henchman ( Michael Ansara ) providing a plethora of bandaged ones . For one of their last efforts , " A & C Meet the Mummy " provides it's measure of laughs , but most have been said and done before . What it proved to me though was what I've thought all along about the casting of the sequels to the original Universal Mummy , why have a name actor like Lon Chaney Jr . portray the title character , when anyone under wraps would have done as well at half the cost ?
368549	2707735	35173	6.0	" I think we can stand more canvas boys , ease the main dorsal jib and break out the spinnaker . "	Two unlikely buddies hijack a bus , stow away on a charter boat , land on an uncharted island , and save the sacred ruby of Mantua . On paper , the concept doesn't seem to work , but with Abbott and Costello , anything is possible . In " Pardon My Sarong " , all this and more combine to present a musical comedy that works even after sixty years . Watching the night club scene , it occurred to me that you never see any act today that features tap dancing , but the efforts of the team of Tic , Tac and Toe make for a very entertaining presentation , combining originality , athleticism and choreography all rolled into one . The musical stylings of The Four Ink Spots are also a treat , and a reasonable alternative to the Andrews Sisters who graced a number of the comedy duo's earlier films . When I saw this movie as a kid , the Big Stinker routine always made me roar , and surprisingly , it still holds up pretty well today in the chuckle department . It's neatly complemented by the " Tree of Truth " gag , with Lou taking his licks each time he makes a comment . There's also a bevy of pretty girls around to offset the nefarious deeds of the evil Doctor Varnoff ( Lionel Atwill ) and his henchmen . It all combines to make an entertaining hour and a half of antic fun for the " moola " team of Abbott and Costello .
368224	2707735	59093	6.0	" . . . a man must know , a man must walk alone . "	The end of the picture really made me think about how this Western turned the traditional good guy / bad guy story on it's head , ending in the death of the hero in a virtually non-climactic finale with the saving posse arriving just a little too late . It's probably how a lot of real life stories ended in the old West , ignominiously and largely forgotten to history . Up till then , the film was strangely devoid of any real action , other than Billy's ( Arch Hall , Jr . ) confrontations with members of the Sam Bass gang . Even Wild Bill Hickok knew better , but you know , I thought he might have been right around the corner to make the save . Oh well . I had the feeling the film was stretching for legitimacy with it's liberal name dropping of true Western legends like Texas John Slaughter , Wyatt Earp , Clay Allison , Red Cloud and Crazy Horse . None of them ever showed up , but you wondered if they would . Sam Bass ( Rex Marlow ) did , but again , the movie had him leading a lynch mob instead of facing down Billy on a dusty street . He didn't care much for Psalm 22 either . Hey , I got a kick out of the sign in Poker Kate's saloon - ' Gentlemen Do Not Spit On Floors ' . The punishment couldn't be worse than death . Not really an altogether bad flick as the limited reviews on this board suggest . The ballad of Billy May even gave the story some additional atmosphere as it popped up from time to time in synch with the story . At least it's nowhere near as campy awful as the Arch Hall ( Sr . and Jr . both ) flick from 1962 - this one doesn't make you go " Eegah " !
368489	2707735	63459	6.0	" I don't know what I've got , but I'm about to share it " .	Abbott and Costello may have wreaked havoc on more branches of the military , but they never tangled with two at the same time the way Bob Hope does in " The Private Navy of Sgt . O'Farrell " . A somewhat uneven comedy , the film makes do with Hope's traditional one liners and does the best it can with a supporting cast that includes Jeffrey Hunter , Phyllis Diller , and Gina Lollabrigida . At the center of the story is Sgt . O'Farrell's ( Hope ) plan to bring women and beer to the island base of Camp Funapee . Once accomplished with mixed results , the story meanders off to allow Hope's character to capture a Japanese submarine single handedly , and close out the story arm in arm with the lovely Maria ( Lollabrigida ) . As for the beer , I was surprised to see that it wasn't Budweiser cans floating all over the Pacific , but those of then heavyweight Milwaukee competitor - Pabst Blue Ribbon . It made me wonder if the Anheuser-Busch folks might have been given a shot at the picture . By the time the film really gets rolling , there's a can of Pabst in just about every scene . Being a long time Bob Hope fan , I can't recall today if Pabst was ever a major sponsor of his programming . But I sure do remember Texaco . Hey , did you catch the nod to one of Hope's earlier pictures ? All the men are on the beach drinking when the Indian private says to Hope - " Excuse me Heap Big Paleface ? " There's also that funny sequence attempting to reenact the beach scene in " From Here to Eternity " ; Hope even throws Lancaster's name out there in a bit of self deprecation . Also , if you were waiting to see if Crosby would show up , there's that clip of " Pennies From Heaven " to keep the streak going . Yet even with all the typical Bob Hope humor , he seems just a bit out of place in this late 1960's flick pretending to be one from the 1940's . This one approached the beach blanket bingo genre just a little too close for my comfort , and I prefer virtually any of his earlier efforts in glorious black and white . For my money , if I'm looking for Hope in a military setting , I'd just as soon tune in to one of his many USO entertainment specials . If memory serves , one of them would also have showcased Gina Lollabrigida and Phyllis Diller .
368186	2707735	32457	6.0	" Things happen to people who know too much . "	A trio of familiar faces reunites in this engaging Mr . Wong mystery - Boris Karloff as the Chinese Detective , Grant Withers as San Francisco Police Captain Bill Street ( though he was " Sam " Street in the first two Wong films ) , and Marjorie Reynolds as feisty Herald newspaper reporter Bobbie Logan . Street " unofficially " seeks Wong's help in solving the murder of friend and fellow detective Dan Grady , who was working on a smuggling detail - " Smuggling and San Francisco mean the Orient " . Besides Grady , the bodies pile up rather quickly in this whodunit ; by the time the film is over there are a total of four corpses . The action moves back and forth between Frank Belden Sr . ' s jewelry shop , the Neptune Club owned by a shady " Hardway " Harry Lockett ( Frank Puglia ) , and the apartment of Belden's financier John Forbes ( Charles Trowbridge ) . Thrown in for good measure are Belden's son Frank Jr . ( Craig Reynolds ) , who has a thing for mysterious vamp Tanya Serova ( Lita Chevret ) . Except for the young Frank Belden , who's acting is a bit forced and over the top , the rest of the cast are all mixed up in the smuggling scheme that Wong rather handily solves by piecing together details involving radio control technology and a rigged telephone call . As we've seen before , Captain Street comes across as a brash blow-hard , but he gets his comeuppance rather nicely at the hands of reporter Logan at the end of the film . With both Wong and Street at the mercy of Forbes ' gun , Bobbie uses an ashtray to fake her own weapon and trick the villain into submission , after which Mr . Wong dials up the Herald with the news - " Oh yes , this is a scoop . "
367662	2707735	12657	6.0	" Get aloft and furl the mainroyal . "	The movie's title comes from the nickname of the captain of ' The Lair ' , John Nelson ( Hobart Bosworth ) - ' recognizing work as the only creed and brute strength as the one law ' . Nelson's bitter nature dates back two decades from the time his wife left him for another man . In a parallel coincidence , businessman Tom Walton ( Emory Johnson ) signs up for a voyage on The Lair after being spurned by his fiancée . Once at sea , Walton befriends Nelson after the crew attempts to mutiny , though they were provoked by Nelson's hoarding the ship's drinking water for himself . Landing on an uncharted island , Walton discovers the two lone survivors of a shipwreck some sixteen years earlier . The young Blossom ( Bessie Love ) was born on the island and raised by her adopted ' Uncle Billy ' ( Richard Morris ) after her mother died during childbirth . Once it's revealed that Blossom recalls her mother's name being Nelson as well , the pieces fall into place for the old Sea Lion . He discovers a Bible diary and learns that his wife was shanghaied away from him , a farewell note manufactured to make it seem that the captain's wife ran away from him . With feelings of remorse , Nelson reunites with the long lost daughter he never knew he had . The movie comes in at just over an hour , and despite the odds defying circumstances of the story , it's one that keeps your interest . One minor downside is the dark rendition of the print , there's a portion of one scene that almost goes entirely black . Considering that it was made eighty five years ago , it's a small inconvenience to observe in a relic dating so far back . A silent from 1921 , it's not the kind of movie you'll find on the rack of your local video store or by cruising the cable channels . However if you keep your eyes peeled , you might find it as I did as part of a ten movie ' Pirates ' themed set on three DVD's released by St . Clair Vision . The set contains mostly titles you never heard of before , but uniquely offers some early screen appearances by future stars like Errol Flynn , Bela Lugosi , and Lon Chaney Jr . For silent film buffs , there's another entry in the collection titled " The Black Pirate " from 1926 , starring an athletic Douglas Fairbanks .
368330	2707735	27707	6.0	" Watch her wiggle , watch her shake , and don't forget to watch that snake ! "	The story synopsis for this film on Encore Westerns stated that after being framed for murder , Gene Autry goes on a search for the real killers . I was wondering if he'd have better luck than OJ , so I tuned in to check it out . Actually , I knew he would , since Autry always gets his man , whether in the movies or on his TV show . This was an early Autry Western for Republic Pictures , utilizing a plot element I haven't seen before . Chief villain Morgan ( J . P . McGowan ) and his top henchman Conners ( Tom London ) attempt to run an infected herd with ' Texas cattle fever ' from Sage County across Colima County , where a quarantine is in effect . Autry's first brush with the bad guys occurs when he saves the sheriff's daughter ( Dorothy Dix ) from the gang . I got a kick out of that gun shot Autry used to knock the hat off Conners ; directly behind Conners were three of his men on horseback and not one of them or their horses were hit ! You know , there's a fair amount of entertainment in this picture for one that comes in just under an hour . Smiley does his usual thing with a colorful tune , and black character Eightball ( Eugene Jackson ) does a neat tap dance . My favorite was the way Dr . Parker ( Earl Hodgins ) discredited the phony vet with his quick delivery on matters of veterinary medicine . Maybe it was another rider , but I would swear that was Gene and Champion that took a tumble during the chase after the bad guys near the finale . If I'm wrong , someone give me a heads up . You know , I was just as curious as the town folk about that five o'clock deadline Connors gave Gene to get out of town . But somehow , it just didn't have the suspense of " High Noon " .
367957	2707735	41429	6.0	" We're starting from scratch . You're a duchess without dough , and I'm a millionaires without a mill " .	With the start of each Bob Hope movie , I begin my countdown as to when Bing Crosby might make a characteristic unscheduled appearance . So imagine my surprise when all of a sudden Jack Benny pops up in a typical skinflint role offering to change a hundred dollar bill for Hope's character . Hope's reaction to whether it was really the perennial thirty nine year old - " Naw , he wouldn't be traveling first class " . You just had to be there during television's Golden Age to make much sense of that scene , which leads me to consider that modern day viewers miss a lot of the in jokes that comedians like Hope , Benny and Crosby were known and caricatured for back in the day . And you know something else ? - they all did it without being off color or offensive , even if they managed to offer up a double entendre or three . That's why I keep going back to their films and TV specials , a neat time capsule reminder of life during a simpler time when we could all laugh at ourselves and each other without the politically correct deterrence of possibly offending someone . As for cameos , it probably wouldn't have passed for one at the time , because George Reeves hadn't achieved notoriety yet as the Man of Steel . However it was pretty cool to see him in an opening scene , even if it didn't end so well for his character . Now here's a line that had me doing some quick research . Duchess Alexandria ( Rhonda Fleming ) remarks to Freddie Hunter ( Hope ) , that " Someday I hope to have seven little boys " . It wasn't till some six years later that Hope would star in the biographical film " The Seven Little Foys " - a strange bit of cosmic serendipity . I wonder if Hope ever thought about that ? The odd thing for me about the story had to do with Hope's alliance with the Boy Foresters in the picture ; for all intents and purposes they were a knockoff of the Boy Scouts , with an oath that was somewhat similar . I wasn't counting , but Hope's character probably managed to break most of the rules regarding Forester behavior . The boys of course , try to keep him on the straight and narrow with mixed results . But then again , who wouldn't stray with Rhonda Fleming on board . With a title like " The Great Lover " , one might expect a bit more in the romance department , but this one is played more for laughs and Hope's quick wit . It's not one of the legendary comedian's best or well known films , but Hope fans will enjoy it , and that after all , is why we tune in .
367589	2707735	89092	6.0	" Earth Man - your Mickey Mouse is one big stupid dope ! "	In the past week , I had seen this movie in the TV cable listings just about every day being offered on a variety of channels . Sensing that this might have been a mysterious calling out to me on some personal level , I decided to watch it . I stayed till the end , but I have to say , I can't for the life of me imagine whatever prompted the film makers to put this thing to celluloid . This would have been interesting if it had been done thirty years earlier in black and white , then it's camp value might have placed it among the revered sci-fi classics of the day . Something along the lines say , of " Creature From The Black Lagoon " , which I was immediately reminded of when ' Jerry ' was shown swimming underwater . Apart from that , the picture is entirely derivative of many sources of sci-fi that had gone before , most notably " Star Wars " , from the opening space battle to the copy cat Sarlaac pit that even burped after consuming an unfortunate victim . Even the confrontation between a human and a reptilian type alien had seen treatment before , almost twenty years earlier in episode # 1 . 18 of Star Trek ( ' Arena ' ) , with Captain Kirk doing the honors of course . And the dialog ? I can only point to my summary comment above - couldn't the writers have come up with anything better than this ? There was only one compelling scene in the picture for me , one that made me stop and think - that being Dennis Quaid's recognition of words from the Drak writings that reflected the spirit of the Lord's Prayer . Just about everything else had me groaning in embarrassment for the two principals . At least Louis Gossett Jr . was able to hide out in his lizard costume . And didn't it seem odd that after three years on the hostile asteroid , Dennis Quaid's character actually looked younger than when he started out ? Sorry folks , I just can't recommend this one , unless you're bombarded by your local cable lineup making it all but impossible to avoid . But I tried to warn you .
368362	2707735	37826	6.0	" Subtle as a blast of TNT , isn't he ? "	The body count reaches an all time high of four in this Charlie Chan film , as Sidney Toler attempts to solve the murder of inventor Dr . Harper , apparently killed for a secret gas formula he was developing for the war effort . The continuity of the Chan films is maintained here , as Edwin Luke joins the cast as Number # 4 son Eddie , preferring to be called Edward . What starts out as a seemingly intelligent role for Edward evolves into what we've seen with the Chan sons in prior outings , although not as over the top as Victor Sen Young's portrayal of Number # 2 son Jimmy - " Every time you open your mouth , you put in more feet than centipede " . Mantan Moreland is on hand and more comfortable in his role as Chan's chauffeur Birmingham Brown , in this his fifth Chan film from Monogram Studios . I got a kick out of one of his lines - " I ain't curious about seein ' no zombies " , as he got to see plenty in two of his earlier films , 1941's " King of the Zombies " , and 1943's " Revenge of the Zombies " . Although nearly everyone in Dr . Harper's household has come to despise him , it's his nephew Archer , an unusually talented quick change artist / ventriloquist / strongman who turns out to be the evildoer . What's curious to me is why he would stick around in a house with a detective , policemen and a coroner all looking for clues as to the identity of the killer . It's standard Chan stuff though , as the outcome is made to seem believable after all the pieces are made to fit .
367793	2707735	29694	6.0	" Well that makes it more interestin ' when the competition's good . "	" Trouble in Texas " appears to be a re-working of the 1934 Lone Star Pictures film , " The Man From Utah " , starring John Wayne ; both were directed by Robert North Bradbury and both utilize the excellent stunt work of Yakima Canutt . In fact , Yak's character in both pictures is pretty much the same , he portrays a champion rodeo rider who's part of a gang of racketeers that insures their top man wins most of the top prize money . Serious challengers never get a chance , usually winding up dead under mysterious circumstances . Tex Ritter acquits himself well in this film , his character is Tex Masters , and he rides the rodeo circuits in hopes of catching up with the gang responsible for his brother's murder five years earlier . But the real bright star of this film is a lovely young lady by the name of Rita Cansino , you might know her better as Rita Hayworth . It's stunning to see how lovely she looks , portraying undercover government agent Carmen Serano who tries to get the goods on the gang by working them from the inside . She's hired by rodeo racketeer Barker ( perennial baddie Earl Dwire ) , and before it's over she gets to show some early singing and dancing talent in an entertaining saloon number . Much of the movie's screen time is taken up by rodeo stock footage , with your standard roping and bulldogging , and a fair amount of native Indian parade and dance . When it comes time for the actual contests , Tex manages to out ride , out rope and outdo his main opponent for the prize money in every event , " Squint " Palmer ( Canutt ) . The gang is unsuccessful in having Masters fall for the old poison needle in the halter trick , but coincidentally , that's how Tex's brother died , so now he's got the goods on all the bad boys , enough for the Middleton sheriff ( Glenn Strange ) to put them all away for good . Quite coincidentally , the same ruse was used in " The Man From Utah " , only the poison needle was positioned in the saddle to do it's dirty work . I get a kick out of the pre-1950 Westerns where the good guy , in this case Tex Ritter , can shoot a gun out of the hand of an opponent , and not have the bullet find it's mark in another person directly in the line of fire . The Lone Ranger would consistently do the same , finding his target and only his target , even when firing right into the middle of a crowd . Horace Murphy offers up some comic relief in the movie as Tex's sidekick Lucky , his gimmick is talking up his non existent heroics in sort of a Gabby Hayes style , but he doesn't have the on screen charisma of a Gabby , or even a Smiley Burnette , kind of a poor man's " pardner " . I got " Trouble in Texas " as a double bill DVD along with Tex Ritter's " Arizona Days " ; available for a buck in one of the dollar chain stores - definitely a bargain for Tex fans , or if you just want to sample Ritter's work without laying out major cash . Of the two , " Trouble " alone will be worth your trouble , especially for the surprising appearance of gorgeous Rita Hayworth .
367885	2707735	44460	6.0	" I don't want any part of any kind of war . . . , it has a bad smell . "	I found it interesting that the film's original working title was " The Rebel " , since some of the early footage was also used in the opening sequence of the 1959 Civil War TV series , " The Gray Ghost " . I'm pretty sure I've also seen it recycled in other movies with a Civil War theme . John Ireland stars as tired ex-soldier Jefferson Waring from Virginia , heading West without a gun and a vow to never use one against men again . Of course that's just the set up for the eventual finale when he does just that to take the side of settlers against scheming landowners led by Artemus Taylor ( Lon Chaney ) . Chaney's character is wheelchair bound throughout the story , but that doesn't prevent him from looking about as spooky as he did in any of his horror flicks . The most complex , actually frustrating character in the story for me was Marshal Harding ( Wayne Morris ) . He's in the pocket of villain Sam Tobin ( Lawrence Tierney ) , but is on the fence most of the time trying to keep a level playing field for Waring and his new friends . Curiously , he never uses his six gun , and actually seems to have an aversion to firing one ; he isn't even part of the finale when the settlers stand up for their rights . Where the film gets really gritty has to do with the treatment of Taylor's daughter Nora , who's every bit as ornery as her father . Following the ambush on Taylor's hired gunmen , she attempts to make a getaway with money from the local bank , and shoots banker Stone ( Charles Trowbridge ) in the process . Now it's not unusual for a woman in a ' B ' Western to get shot , even killed , but here , when Stone recovers , he shoots her IN THE BACK - Wow ! That was something I never thought I'd see , in fact , never even thought about it , even though it happened all the time when men were involved . A couple of things to keep an eye out for - early in the story when Waring first meets Peter Sharpe ( Frank Marlowe ) , they sit down , and Sharpe begins his conversation with " You know Randall . . . " . Ireland's character looks at Sharpe as if to say , ' hey , that's not my name ' , but the scene continues . Later on , I got a kick out of the funeral service being held in the local saloon for a couple that was killed by Taylor's goons . Right there on top of the bar was a sign stating - ' Bar Closed During Services ' !
368231	2707735	50625	7.0	" You sure must like a bad gamble . "	It didn't take too long into the picture to realize that I had seen it before , the first time being 1963's " Gunfight At Comanche Creek " starring Audie Murphy in the George Montgomery role . In checking the film credits , it surprised me to learn that different writers are listed for each film , even though ' Gunfight ' is a virtual scene for scene re-creation of the original picture ; both were released by Allied Artists . The 1963 film scores a bit higher by IMDb voters , and I'll tell you why - Murphy in the lead role , and ' Bones ' McCoy himself , DeForest Kelley in the lead villain role as the outlaw gang leader . Not to say that Montgomery wasn't just as effective in his role as the undercover agency plant , but Murphy was the war hero . On the plus side for the earlier version , at least for me , was James Best as the conflicted outlaw who befriends Montgomery's character . There's really no point in going into any more detail here , my review of " Gunfight At Comanche Creek " pretty much tells the story . I did get a kick though out of the sign outside the barber shop in ' Badmen ' - " Up To Date System - Hot Towel " - who could pass up a come on like that ! Otherwise , depending on which film you might have seen first , you'll know what's coming in the second . At least Reed Hadley was credited for the voice over narration in ' Comanche Creek ' , incessant as it was , and totally unnecessary to follow the story .
368435	2707735	65079	7.0	" One way or another , you die in the end . "	It was curious to me that ' Willie Boy ' came out the same year that " Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid " did . Redford looks so much younger here ; it must have been the mustache as The Kid . Curiously , he had a similar scene here with Susan Clark as Sundance did with Katharine Ross , a kind of surprise bedroom attack that was used as misdirection before the true relationships became known . Robert Blake does a convincing job as Willie Boy , on the run from the law with his ' captured wife ' after killing her father in self defense . The film offers varying degrees of the racial divides and tensions between whites and Native Americans during turn of the century America . Sheriff Chris Cooper ( Redford ) treads that line carefully , as he knows he must bring Willie Boy to justice , but is keenly aware that it wouldn't take much for his search party to turn into a lynch mob . All the while , one wonders how the final confrontation might take place , knowing that Willie Boy is not the type to go down without a fight . The prelude to that showdown is perhaps even more of a shocker , as Willie's girl Lola commits the ultimate sacrifice so her man has a better chance of escaping . I haven't seen Robert Blake in a lot of films besides this and " In Cold Blood " , though I was a regular viewer of ' Baretta ' . I liked that show , which had a reasonably authentic ' street ' feel to it back in the Seventies . I often wondered why Blake never broke out to greater mainstream success until I saw him once on a late night talk show . His entire stint consisted of a rambling rant on government conspiracies and assorted complaints against authority , and he came across like a nut case . It's sad that he wound up at the center of his wife's murder mystery in recent years , a far cry from the once cute kid who graced the screen with the Little Rascals and as Red Ryder's sidekick .
367679	2707735	38991	7.0	" It's my job to bring escaped Nazis to justice . "	It struck me while watching " The Stranger " that this could have been an Alfred Hitchcock film , what with the clock tower motif and the stairs / ladder plot element , not to mention the Nazi connection with Hitch's " Notorious " . Considering all that , there are a number of counterbalancing effects that prevent the film from being as great as it could have been . Orson Welles is believable up to a point as escaped Nazi war criminal Franz Kindler , masquerading as college professor Charles Rankin in a small Connecticut town . Yet his performance is uneven , with the cold calculating former Nazi virtually falling apart as he brings his new wife Mary ( Loretta Young ) up to speed regarding his criminal past . It's difficult to believe that the mastermind of the Nazi death camps would have so easily given himself away to face capture and punishment , let alone hang around for War Crime Commission czar Wilson ( Edward G . Robinson ) to put him away . At least Rankin had the good sense to avoid being seen after crawling around in the dirt following his dispatch of Meinike ( Konstantin Shayne ) . But really , his absence from the entire wedding reception was never adequately dealt with , and Mary's reaction never got hostile the way a real newlywed would have . That was a neat touch with the preoccupied Rankin scribbling away at a Nazi swastika while setting up his wife for a quick exit . If you suspend critical judgment while watching , " The Stranger " winds up as a fair enough thriller , owing primarily to Robinson's character methodically working the town's citizens to help expose his victim . However it was with an unintended chuckle that I came away from the story , considering the way Rankin deliberately murdered his former associate ; here in fact was the basis for the original Meinike muffler .
367586	2707735	54757	7.0	" Monsieur , words are what men live by , words are what they mean " .	It didn't take me long to get beyond the opening scene's mention of it being 1843 , and the idea that Paul Regret ( Stuart Whitman ) got to walk away from a hanging for killing the son of a ranking official in a duel . After that it's all entertainment value in the pairing of Whitman and John Wayne in a lively Western that introduces additional colorful characters along the way . There's not much chance of forgetting Lee Marvin as the rabble rousing Tully Crow ; you couldn't bet going in that he wouldn't have lasted much more than a few minutes the way his character was presented . Then there was Edgar Buchanan in the kind of role he was born to play as the conniving Circuit Court Judge who gets to see it the Ranger way . I was also impressed by Big Boy Guinn Williams in his last movie appearance , looking a lot older than I'm used to , but delivering the ' real ' Ed McBain in a credible role . The interesting thing about the picture is that it keeps twisting and turning in different directions , and you never quite see what's coming clearly . There's a good mix of action , humor and camaraderie with Wayne playing off his co-stars as well as any picture I've seen him in . And of course , the Utah and Arizona location filming is pleasing to the eye . " The Comancheros " is one of those films that seems to make regular rounds of the cable channels , so catching it shouldn't be much of a problem . It's worth a viewing if you can disregard the historical inaccuracies and concentrate on the performances of the principals . Wayne and Whitman have a great chemistry together , and along with the scenery , Ina Balin does a commendable job as the daughter of a Comanchero renegade and Paul Regret's love interest .
368295	2707735	41555	7.0	" Live fast , die young , and have a good lookin ' corpse . "	Columbia Pictures borrows a page from the Warner Brothers play book with this 1949 film , but where the WB would present a social commentary and let the viewer decide his own opinion , this film hits you over the head repeatedly with the notion that social ills are the cause of every youth gone wrong . Even Bogart's character , attorney Andrew Morton seems ready and willing to accept a major share of the blame for his client's behavior . Sorry folks , not buying it . Said client , the rebellious Nick Romano , is shown in a number of situations where instead of making the right decision , his choices end up getting him in trouble with the law . Or worse . Having found a good woman ( Allene Roberts as Emma ) to offer encouragement and support , Nick continues to spiral out of control with a hot head and hot fists . That she commits suicide is only one of the more melodramatic moments in a film that won't concede that just maybe " Pretty Boy " Romano is a career hoodlum by choice and not by chance . Bogart's character may not have added much in the way of role model either . When Nick steals a hundred dollars from Morton while away on a fishing trip , the attorney's response is to ' jackroll ' the kid in an alley back in the city , while both are on dates with their gals . I wonder what the attorney / client privilege has to say about that one . Meant to be a breakout movie for John Derek , " Knock on Any Door " is sometimes noted to be his debut film , though he had a couple of credits to his name by this time . Instead , the film further enhanced the directorial career of Nicholas Ray , who went on to create one of the defining films of the mid 1950's - " Rebel Without a Cause " . He and Bogey teamed up once more for " In A Lonely Place " . For Bogart , this one doesn't seem to be one of his better performances , he seems a bit unaccustomed to being on the right side of the law . With limited screen time in the second half of the picture , George Macready as the prosecuting attorney , and Barry Kelley as Judge Drake offer solid support to the courtroom drama , particularly Kelley who's called upon to rein in the opposing lawyers who viciously snipe each other . John Derek plays out the ' pretty boy ' angle right out to the closing frame , a bit unnerving to see him prepare for the electric chair by slicking back his hair one last time .
368102	2707735	32022	7.0	" He stole my watch , my girl and my car . . . , yeah , serves him right . "	It's always a good feeling when a movie delivers the goods when you weren't expecting it . The Dead End Kids / Bowery Boys found themselves in a lot of uneven films , and usually did better when in a support role , as in " Angels With Dirty Faces " . Here , their presence as a backdrop to the story of a boxer framed for murder gives them a lot of screen time without distracting from the main action . John Garfield is light heavyweight champion Johnny Bradfield , a southpaw hitter who's a lot different from the image he portrays to the sports world and the press . When a newspaper reporter inadvertently learns that Johnny's a party loving womanizer , his plans to spill that information in a column is interrupted by a whiskey bottle to the head from Johnny's manager Doc Ward ( Robert Gleckler ) . In turn , Doc talks Johnny's girlfriend Goldie ( Ann Sheridan ) into running off with him to avoid the legal hassle of dealing with the reporter's death . As both flee , a police chase winds up in a fiery car wreck , and Doc's body is misidentified as Johnny from the gold watch he was wearing . Claude Rains adopts an Edward G . Robinson sneer that doesn't quite work as a detective who's been reassigned to morgue detail after a bad arrest years ago . His character is Monty Phelan , and he has a pretty good hunch that the body in the car crash wasn't Johnny . He pesters his boss to hand over the closed case to him , and is given the assignment to get him out of town and out of the way . Meanwhile , Johnny looks for advice from his lawyer , and winds up being screwed even worse when he gets conned for most of his ten thousand dollar savings . Making his way cross country , Johnny winds up at the Rancho Rafferty Date Farm in Arizona , run by a crusty Granny Rafferty ( May Robson ) . The farm is the legacy of Granny's brother , a deceased priest from Brooklyn , and is now the home of a band of rag tag street boys ( The Dead End Kids ) who work the farm . Billy Halop is the nominal leader of the boys in this one , and his sister Peggy ( Gloria Dickson ) becomes the romantic interest for Johnny , now going by the name of Jack Dorney . I get a kick out of the historical perspective offered in these pre-War era films . When Johnny and the boys take a joy ride in the farm's truck , they fill up at a gas station for a $1 . 28 ! Tommy ( Halop ) gets the idea that a gas station on the farm would be a good way to earn some extra money , and with that thought , Jack Dorney decides to take on a barnstorming boxer offering $500 a round to anyone who can stay in the ring with him . The clichéd premise is turned on it's ear somewhat when Jack gets knocked out in the fifth round , but by then he's earned enough to give the fruit farm a fighting chance of it's own . Maybe Grandma Rafferty should have been in the ring , she just about took out everyone sitting around her at ringside . As Johnny / Jack comes around in the locker room , Detective Phelan is on hand to take him into custody . Knowing that he can redeem his reputation with this collar , it's a toss up as to whether Phelan follows through on his arrest - you'll have to watch the film to find out . I like the Dead End films where Leo Gorcey's in charge , but he doesn't have a lot to do in this one . However he does a great film flam on the ticket taker at the gate of the boxing match . Another thought - wouldn't it have been great if the ever present picture on the wall of the priest had been that of Pat O'Brien ? All in all , this is a pretty good entry in both the John Garfield and Dead End Kids filmography , and an entertaining way to spend an hour and a half . If there's one downside , it's not enough screen time for pretty Ann Sheridan . The film might have wound up even more satisfying if the roles of Sheridan and Gloria Dickson were reversed , as the on screen chemistry between Dickson's Peggy and Jack seemed more forced than natural .
367956	2707735	60777	7.0	" From now on , you ain't got nothing to worry about " .	If you're a Western movie genre fan , you've probably caught the classics " Shane " and " 3 : 10 to Yuma " , with Van Heflin in prominent supporting roles . The surprise in " The Ruthless Four " is that Heflin leaves both of those prior characterizations firmly in the dust with a strong lead role as Sam Cooper , a grizzled gold prospector who's saddled with a trio of partners when his plans called for only one man he could trust . Coming near the end of his career , Heflin pulls out all the stops to give a noteworthy performance , and I'd be hard pressed to come up with another that was any better than this . Rounding out the ' ruthless ' quartet finds George Hilton portraying Cooper's adopted son Manolo , Klaus Kinski as Manolo's enigmatic former companion , and Gilbert Roland's Mason , hired on by Cooper to keep the others honest while he's trying to cover his own back . The homosexual subtext between Manolo and Brent the Blonde ( Kinski ) is the subject of a couple of quick teases in the story , and is never fully developed . However there's not much more explanation for Brent's intrusion into the expedition , which gives Cooper some pause as to Manolo's reliability . It's also not immediately apparent that Mason ( Roland ) will prove honorable by the time the film winds down , so that gives the picture another hook to keep the viewer interested . On top of all that , you've got a pair of brother bad guys hovering around on the fringe of the action hoping to cash in by the time the picture's over . However it all could have gone down hill with a puzzling opening scene when Sam Cooper's original partner in the gold dig turns on him with the idea of taking it all for himself . Those kinds of scenes always bothered me when I was growing up - here was a gun man who had the drop on his partner with the intention of killing him , and then he doesn't kill him . I mean , why leave anything to chance when you can win the whole ball of wax right there . But instead , in an attempt to what , be fair ? , the guy challenges his foe to draw down . When anything can happen , and it usually does , the villain loses , and it serves him right for being such an idiot . And how about when Cooper was waylaid by the bandits who stole his horses but left the gold sacks ? What movie were they watching ? Come to think of it , how did one of the bandits get behind Cooper to knock him out with a rock ? Cooper had his back to the river and it wasn't like he couldn't keep an eye on all of his attackers . Just a very clumsy scene that didn't make very much sense to me . But get beyond those couple of examples , and the rest of the story is pretty intriguing , with some interesting twists and turns that move the picture to a climactic showdown . This had to be the only time I ever saw a cowboy on horseback use an umbrella in the rain ( Manolo ) , and Kinski ordering up a glass of milk in the saloon was definitely an oddity . The only sure thing , if you can call it that , would be that Van Heflin would come out pretty much as he went in , as last man standing . How each of his partners fared , well , that's for you to find out , as this wasn't called " The Ruthless Four " for nothing .
367678	2707735	37536	7.0	" And a gift to the Church you know , is tax deductible . "	Two preconceptions I had of the film were summarily dismissed after my initial viewing ; it's not technically a Christmas movie , and the ' battle ' of wills between Sister Mary Benedict ( Ingrid Bergman ) and Father O'Malley ( Bing Crosby ) is never more than a shadow of the main event I expected . That's not to say it's a bad thing , I just expected more fireworks between the two . The thought occurred to me that the film is one that probably would never be made today , with it's overt depiction of the Roman Catholic faith and people committed to a life of service to God . Politically correct times may allow for the parody of a " Sister Act " , but not an honest exploration of religious themes , as they might ' offend ' someone . As for myself , I can't be persuaded to choose Happy Holidays over Merry Christmas to appease the liberal left . Which makes Crosby's line all the more funnier when he reacts to a student's name - " Luther , how'd he get in here " ? I was listening attentively to the children reciting the Pledge of Allegiance early in the story . The words ' under God ' had not yet been made part of the Pledge as we know it today . You'll encounter the same situation in the 1938 Humphrey Bogart movie " Crime School " , when the Pledge is recited in a prison yard . It wasn't until Flag Day , June 14th , 1954 , that the additional words were added upon the approval of President Dwight Eisenhower . Hey , wasn't that a great scene with the kids performing the Joseph and Mary skit ? I wonder if that was done in one take , as Crosby and Bergman took great delight in surmising that the next time around would produce different results . Der Bingle's O'Malley had it right I think , it was perfect as it was . Which only adds to the charm of this period piece , as do so many other scenes that convey the spirit and warmth of a time gone by . Still , one thing puzzles me - how did they get the cat to do that hat trick ?
368230	2707735	37622	7.0	" . . . he's the guy who says who does it to who and for how much . "	I've seen a number of poor films from Poverty Row studio PRC Pictures , but this has to be one of their better efforts , an unusually involved gangster flick that pits bad guys against bad guys and a grand jury attempting to get the goods on a big time crime syndicate . Newspaper reporter Jim Riley ( Tom Neal ) gets unusually close to mobster Bugs Kelley ( Danny Morton ) by saving him from a rub out , only to hear of his eventual demise for refusing to join Crime , Inc . One of the more interesting casting decisions has to be that of Leo Carillo as Tony Marlowe , finger man for the mob , and diametrically opposed in character to the one he portrayed as the Cisco Kid's sidekick in all those Western films and TV shows . It was a bit surprising to see him pull off a serious role without going for one of those hysterical malapropisms , although he did place a five thousand dollar bet that turned out to be a contract hit on Bugs Kelley . With the film coming in at about seventy five minutes , the windup did seem to be just a bit too tidy , as all the elements fell into place to bring the members of the crime organization to justice . I think I'll need another viewing to make the connection with the crooked cop who leaked information to the criminals , as that seemed to blow by rather quickly . The romantic subplot between Riley and Kelley's sister Betty ( Martha Tilton ) didn't seem especially necessary for the story , but it didn't hurt either . Say , how was that for an impromptu wedding ceremony as the final curtain came down ? I always found it helpful when watching the Charlie Chan films of the era to keep a scorecard to track the many characters who were introduced during the course of the story . The same applies here , as it's easy to get the good guys confused with the villains and vice versa . Like Lionel Atwill and Sheldon Leonard , you wind up marveling at their appearance in the story well before you figure out which side they're on !
368178	2707735	58390	7.0	" You'll be sleeping on the skin of a nightmare for the rest of your life " .	This was my first experience of a Sam Fuller picture , and I have to say , it was quite the revelation . The entire film keeps you slightly off balance , starting right out of the gate with that bizarre opening , which could have had any number of interpretations . It was interesting that the full details of that encounter weren't revealed until some time later in the story , by which time I had started to form a different idea of what had originally happened . But the scene that changed the entire picture for me had to be Kelly's ( Constance Towers ) discovery of Grant's ( Michael Dante ) pedophilia . Even though it was all done by inference and suggestion , I was immediately creeped out by the assault on innocence that changed the whole complexion of the story on a dime . Kelly's reaction was swift and deadly , and in keeping with the street smarts gained from a life of prostitution . I was surprised to see that this film was made as late as 1964 . It had a lot of the earmarks of the type of ' educational ' film that came out of the 1930's and ' 40's that have earned cult status for their camp portrayals . I'm thinking of titles like " Delinquent Daughters " and " Slaves in Bondage " , but here , the emphasis doesn't seem to be on creating sensationalism as much as forcing the viewer to think outside the box regarding aberrant behavior . Grant's conversation when he's outed as a pervert is particularly revealing ; he believes that he and Kelly could have a wonderful marriage because they're both abnormal . How's that for a rationale ? For it's unusual and offbeat subject matter , " The Naked Kiss " is a stunningly surprising movie , one that won't appeal to every taste , but it certainly leaves it's impact on the viewer in a way that precariously treads the line between entertainment and revulsion . Constance Towers is unusually effective in maintaining credibility for her character after the shock of that opening scene wears off . This is only the second time I've seen a bald woman in a picture , the first being Persis Khambatta in the 1979 flick - " Star Trek : The Motion Picture " . In both instances , there's something to say about how sexy a bald woman can be under the right circumstances . I think Captain Kirk would agree .
368399	2707735	305206	7.0	" You know , an ordinary life is pretty complex stuff . "	With all the critical acclaim and awards lavished on the film , I'd have to say that maybe I missed something here . I guess it's just that I don't find ' depressing ' to be interesting , and to have an entire film devoted to that cause , well let's say it wasn't inspirational . I'll grant kudos where appropriate though , the mixed footage of Paul Giamatti's Harvey and the real Harvey Pekar was clever and worked most of the time . But the real Harvey didn't seem to invite any type of empathy for what he might have gone through , even for a cancer survivor . Let's face it , challenging Letterman when he deserves it is one thing , but challenging the audience and then slapping them down is pretty much the height of arrogance . I can't even say I understood what Pekar was going for with the Letterman rant , he probably didn't know himself . Overall nice work by Giamatti and Hope Davis ; Judah Friedlander as Toby Radloff was a bit creepy in his portrayal if even remotely accurate . For the real Harvey - try to lighten up , it's supposed to be good for your health . As for the real Joyce Brabner , she just might be a saint .
368481	2707735	29648	7.0	" Well there's nothing like a murder to ruin a perfectly good evening . "	I usually find it helpful to keep a scorecard when watching a Charlie Chan film to keep track of all the characters , for this one , you need it just for the action . Yikes ! - it took about twenty movies in the Chan franchise to build up to four dead bodies in one outing , but here they pile up fast and furious . Mr . Moto ( Peter Lorre ) is not above dispatching a few himself , and just as he did in the first film of the series ( Think Fast , Mr . Moto ) , winds up throwing a man over board . There are other similarities as well , the biggest coincidence being the use of the name Marco Polo ; here it's the name of a bridge , while in ' Think Fast ' , it was the name of a cruise ship . By this time , we know Moto to be an importer operating as a detective , but here we learn that he's also an adventurer , explorer , soldier of fortune and one of the Orient's great mysteries . Or so he's described by businessman Tom Nelson ( Thomas Beck ) . In the story , Moto seeks to protect a missing scroll that when joined together with others to form a pattern , indicates the location of the burial place of Genghis Khan and a vast treasure . Of course , a host of others seek to own the desired scroll , as much as Madame Chung ( Pauline Frederick ) and her son , the Prince ( Philip Ahn ) are determined to protect it . Oddities abound in the film , as in the opening scene when Moto in disguise dispatches an assassin in the Gobi Desert , and proceeds to bury him - inside the tent ! John Carradine makes an appearance in the story as an antiques dealer named Periera , and for some unexplained reason uses the terms ' senor ' and ' senorita ' when addressing Nelson and Eleanor Joyce ( Jayne Regan ) . And say , could there really have been an American bar in China in 1937 called ' Mike's Place ' ? But you know what , most of it doesn't matter , because Mr . Moto is a bundle of energy uncovering the bad guys and tracking down the stolen Chung scrolls . He even concocts a romantic link between the main heavy Koerger ( Sidney Blackmer ) and Miss Joyce to create a jealous rage in Madame Tchernov ( Nedda Harrigan ) , thereby undermining the villains ' plot to discover the treasure . But the biggest shock of all is the way it ends , and for that you'll have to see the picture . With just a couple of the Mr . Moto films under my belt for now , it's quite unusual to see how differently he operates compared to the other Oriental Detectives of the era , notably Charlie Chan and Mr . Wong . Whereas the latter two solved their cases much more methodically , Moto combines clever analysis and martial action to achieve his results , and the results are entirely entertaining . Peter Lorre adds a distinctive flair to the Moto persona , and gets one excited about catching the next film in the series - Oh , so !
367821	2707735	58329	7.0	" And I've caught something really wild this time , haven't I ? "	For any sense of appreciation for this movie , I think you first have to get past the absurdity of the basic plot . You figure that Mark Rutland became president of his family's business because he had a fair amount of business acumen and a semblance of common sense . Once he realizes that Mary Taylor has robbed his safe and has a history of aliases in other cities doing the same , how is it he keeps the romance going ? Especially when Marnie makes every effort to dissuade him at every turn . They say love is blind and marriage is an eye opener , but it seems to me that Rutland had his eyes sewn shut . With that off my chest , director Hitchcock does a decent enough job of maintaining intrigue and suspense in the story ; the aforementioned safe robbery scene with the cleaning lady was particularly noteworthy . Yet at the same time , I have to wonder why Hitch resorted to such almost comical techniques as used in the riding sequence of the fox hunt scene and the rapid zoom in and out of the money in the safe . The latter reminded me of some of those 1940's Warner Brothers cartoons that employ a similar device . It had the feel of a fledgling director who might still be searching for his own vision in making a picture instead of someone with a whole pile of them under his belt already . I have to tell you though , the scene that made me wince was Marnie's horse taking that fall over the jump . You know what the biggest surprise for me was ? Finding out that actress Louise Latham played the parts of both the elder Mrs . Edgar and the young mother of Marnie in the scene with the sailor . The makeup job was so good for both characterizations that it even fooled Hitchcock's assistant director on the set , who asked who the actress was to show up for the flash back filming . Coming off of Hitchcock's suspense thriller " The Birds " , I thought Tippi Hedren did more than a competent job as the conflicted title character , bringing a range of emotion to a role that could have wound up a caricature if not done as well . Opposite Sean Connery , Hedren wondered how she could pull it off . Credit director Hitchcock with a firm but insightful bit of advice - " It's called acting " .
368446	2707735	48801	7.0	" I'll say one thing for crooks , they give you an honest day's work . "	Consider the casting for the three leads in " We're No Angels " - Humphrey Bogart , Peter Ustinov and Aldo Ray . It doesn't seem to work on paper , but in this film , the trio have such a comedic rapport that the film winds up a delight . The setting is Christmas Day 1895 , and all three are escaped convicts from Devil's Island with the notion of returning to Paris aboard a ship anchored in Cayenne harbor . What starts out as a casual afternoon to steal some money and kill some time , turns into a mission for the amiable villains . They spot a likely target , the shop of proprietors Felix and Amelie Ducotel ( Leo G . Carroll and Joan Bennett ) . Offering their help to fix the shop's roof , they eavesdrop their way into the lives and hearts of their hosts , which also includes daughter Isabelle ( Gloria Talbott ) . Leo G . Carroll plays his role along the same lines as his Topper character , amiable but somewhat bumbling . It's no wonder the shop makes no money ; Bogart's observation - " I got ten years for a better set of books than this " . To create just the right amount of tension , Felix Ducotel's cousin Andre Trochard ( Basil Rathbone ) arrives to take stock of the business , and can find no better fun than to spend Christmas Day going over the books . In tow is his nephew Paul ( John Baer ) , for whom Isabelle has nursed a year long crush . In a mock trial , the criminal trio find Andre guilty and leave it to their pet snake Adolph to carry out the sentence . " We're no Angels " is one of those rare films in which you find yourself rooting for the bad guys . The one liners are brilliant , and shared equally among the three rogues . With deadpan delivery , Ustinov's Character Jules lovingly refers to the Ducotel's - " People like that , how can you cut their throats ? " . At film's end , the strain of playing it straight with the Ducotel's causes the convicts to reevaluate their plans ; it would be much easier to return to prison where they can feel more at home . The dapper trio sport halos as they make their way back , with one more for good measure for Adolph . This is not your typical Christmas movie fare , but I can understand how it could wind up on your list of holiday favorites .
368184	2707735	37939	7.0	" I think I'm getting a mickey . "	Setting the stage for this 1945 comedy , Dexter Broadhurst ( Bud ) and Sebastian Dimwiddie ( Lou ) team up to save the " River Queen " from a trio of card sharks , who have gained a three quarter interest from Captain Sam Jackson ( Henry Travers ) in a rigged card game . The Captain's daughter Carolyn ( Lois Collier ) never gives up hope , and plays on the sympathies of villain Crawford ( Alan Curtis ) as the boys whiz through a host of their comedic sketches . They include " My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean " , feathers in the cake , the catfish dinner , the fishing routine , and Lou's shaving routine opposite baddie Joe Sawyer . But they all take a back seat to the famous " Who's on First ? " routine , which remains one of my all time favorite bits . The comedic timing is flawless , though in this case , the audience reaction is non existent at the request of the film's director - probably a bad decision as one's reaction is that these guys should play off the audience as much as each other . The movie's finale revs up to a high energy frenzy after the gamblers are dealt a losing hand with a cold deck by a remorseful Crawford in a one hand , winner take all bluff . Henry Travers is probably best remembered for his role as the angel Clarence , earning his wings in the memorable " It's a Wonderful Life " . Though taken advantage of , he maintains his integrity through thick and thin . But with Abbott and Costello on board , you know that the bad guys don't stand a chance . And with all the mayhem , it's easy to forget that the film also stands up as a musical , with an assortment of tunes to lend counterpoint to the sketches along the way .
368275	2707735	29511	7.0	" Well Jamieson , there's your new Army . "	Warner Brothers got a lot of mileage out of films offering social commentary and reflecting on the ills of society in the 1930's and ' 40's . " San Quentin " is their take on the drudgery of the prison system and how one man hopes to bring self respect to that class of inmates that wants to go straight . I don't know how accurate the set up for the film might be . Army Officer Steve Jamieson ( Pat O'Brien ) is on leave from the Army for a special assignment as Yard Captain at San Quentin State Prison . He's replacing the interim boss Lt . Druggin ( Barton MacLane ) , who's manner is the typical caricature one envisions of a tough prison guard . Druggin stews over his demotion as Jamieson tries to balance toughness with compassion , giving the prisoners a break when it's deserved . The thorn in Jamieson's side will be Joe " Red " Kennedy ( Humphrey Bogart ) , a petty criminal who winds up in the big house after his last job . Complicating matters is Joe's sister Mae ( Ann Sheridan ) , who's budding romance with Jamieson winds up distorting the perception of the other inmates , who feel Joe is receiving special treatment . Taking advantage of the situation is convict Sailor Boy Hanson ( Joe Sawyer ) , arriving at San Quentin with Joe at the same time . When Hanson plans his breakout , he wants Joe by his side , having earned Hanson's respect when the two got into a tussle some time earlier . The blustery Druggin sees an opportunity to take Jamieson down a peg when he's tipped off about the breakout by another convict . Assigning Hanson to an outside yard detail allows Sailor Boy to plan an escape with the help of his girl friend ( Veda Ann Borg ) . Things go badly though , as Hanson grabs Druggin hostage during the escape , and both lose their lives in unrelated mishaps . A passing train offers Joe a handy getaway , and he high tails it back to Mae's place to seek refuge . Too late Joe realizes that maybe Jamieson was on the level ; forcing his way back to San Quentin with a bullet in his gut , Bogey gets to crack wise one last time , but it comes out a bit corny - " Tell the cons to play ball with him , he's swell . " The trio of Humphrey Bogart , Pat O'Brien and Ann Sheridan would wind up making three films together . Their first was 1937's " The Great O'Malley " , followed by " San Quentin " , winding up together again in the following year's " Angels With Dirty Faces " , where they would take supporting roles to James Cagney and the Dead End Kids . The first two don't seem to be commercially available , so you'll have to catch them in a venue like Turner Classic Movies or seek them through private collectors . Though not their best efforts , the films are worth seeing for their portrayals of life in a bygone era , when life was simpler but just as complicated at the same time .
368510	2707735	46754	7.0	" Life every now and then behaves as though it had seen too many bad movies . . . "	The title suggests a more whimsical tone , but " The Barefoot Contessa " is anything but , instead it's a dark and dreary examination of a doomed Cinderella who would have been happier if left undiscovered . Ava Gardner portrays that Cinderella , rising from an impoverished heritage in a dysfunctional family to a life of Hollywood glamor and parties on the Riviera . Not once though do you get the impression that she enjoys any of it ; even at her wedding the servants have more fun than the aristocrats . Told in flashback style through the eyes of three men close to the Contessa's career , the film is a savage indictment of celebrity phoniness and the corruption of money and power . Oddly , Humphrey Bogart's character , a screen writer and director , manages to make it through the entire affair with a semblance of dignity and respect . Battling his own alcoholism , Harry Dawes ( Bogart ) is believable when he challenges studio boss Kirk Edwards ( Warren Stevens ) and confronts publicist Oscar Muldoon ( Edmond O'Brien ) for the snake oil machinations of his occupation . Actually , O'Brien's performance is a mini standout for the picture , one that earned him a Best Supporting Oscar . Any scene involving his character makes you want to run for a shower . It may have been a line in the film , but if not , I like the comparison of Bogart's character as a ' fairy godfather ' to Gardner's Maria Vargas . Harry Dawes is at the same time a participant and a watchful outsider in Vargas ' career progress , with only his own good intentions for a reward . We get a good insight into his motivation when he pulls a fast one on Edwards by inviting three international film agents to a showing of the Vargas screen test . Now they all realize her star potential , virtually guaranteeing that she not be bullied into a one sided contract . Maria Vargas ' own dreams never seem to mesh with her meteoric rise to stardom , instead she always longs for solace in the arms of a life partner who can bring about a happy ending to the Cinderella story . Instead , the hopelessly naive actress settles on an arbitrary solution to carry on the Favrini heritage that virtually assures her doom . Ultimately , the film dissolves into a dark and utterly sad finale for a character whose life worked out as if it had been the subject of too many bad movies .
367675	2707735	71589	7.0	" We're all sinners , or about to be . "	I picked up this flick as part of a double film DVD offer along with " The Hanged Man " for just a buck , and truth be told , both movies were a whole lot better than either had a right to be for the price . The title on this one was " The Gun and The Cross " , close enough to the original to get the message across . The title character wields both , as Marjoe Gortner is revealed to be gunfighter Ernie Parsons , masquerading as a preacher after he finds a real one who was bushwhacked . Donning the clothes of the dead minister , he arrives at the town of Castle Walk just in time to help the local folk deal with nasty town boss Ross ( David Huddleston ) . It's fairly formulaic , with nods to 1952's " High Noon " and 1973's " High Plains Drifter " , along with a preview of 1985's " Pale Rider " . However with it's own spin on things , it comes across both interesting and entertaining , particularly with the inclusion of Pamela Sue Martin as Gortner's love interest . Their scenes together are played both for romance and camp value , and I got a kick out of Sally ( Martin ) explaining how she wouldn't be the youngest widow in town if Parsons were to meet his demise . Along with the principals , you have some fine supporting players doing character portrayals you might have seen before ; Slim Pickens as a sidekick of the preacher , Geoffrey Lewis as a hired gun , and Estelle Parsons , who starts out somewhat annoying as Sally's mom . but then settles down a bit to accept the preacher and his mission . The ending comes as just a bit of a surprise , and you have to fill in your own blanks as to the town's reaction , especially Sally's , when Gortner's character realizes Billy's ( Pickens ) advice is correct . Though it's not likely to show up on TV again , it wouldn't hurt to check out the bargain bins at your local store every now and then to see if this one turns up .
367751	2707735	119396	7.0	" . . . and that my friend , was a clear cut case of him or me . "	OK , so how did Jackie Brown get the half million dollars out of Mexico ? She's an airline hostess , not a stewardess , and she's never shown making a flight . I also missed the part where someone writes a withdrawal slip for all that cash . But aside from that glaring plot hole , and if you don't think about it too much , you can have a pretty good time with " Jackie Brown " . But don't expect the reckless abandon and frenetic fury of the two films that put Quentin Tarantino on the map , you know the ones I'm talking about . What you have here is a more controlled pace and a linear approach that's easier to follow than Tarantino's signature moves . That gives the viewer a little more time to anticipate what might come next , but even then you're caught off guard by certain scenes . You might have expected Beaumont ( Chris Tucker ) to get whacked , but having Louis ( Robert De Niro ) waste Melanie ( Bridget Fonda ) was a left field stunner . Which brings me back to the suspension of disbelief necessary to pull this one off . You have a broad daylight shooting in the parking lot of the ' world's largest indoor mall ' and not one other person is in the vicinity ? What I don't want to do is talk myself into not liking this film , which I see now might be easy enough to do . Instead I'll focus on the characters , with De Niro delivering a sublime performance as a small time hood to Samuel L . Jackson's bad a - - self confidence . Pam Grier's Jackie was in total control , with a range that gave the film a lot of it's energy . The surprise though might have been Robert Forster's character Max Cherry , flying so far under the radar as an actor that I can't believe he's garnered over a hundred film credits , and I can't picture him in even one . Round it out with Fonda and Michael Keaton and you've got a lot of talent keeping things just near the boiling point . With the movie now hitting the ten year mark , it's interesting to see how director Tarantino goes back to the well for his latest effort in the two part " Grindhouse " feature . " Nothing gets between me and my A-K " could have been a trailer for that one , and who can miss the connection between Max Cherry and Cherry Darling ?
368153	2707735	49029	7.0	" There won't be any strange faces in Apache Bend tonight . "	With Raymond Burr forever etched in the minds of TV watchers as lawyer Perry Mason , it's somewhat uncharacteristic to see him toting a handgun as the main heavy in a sagebrush yarn like " The Brass Legend " . He looks the part too , all gruff and unruly , and perhaps with a girth I hadn't noticed before . Hugh O'Brian looks just right for the part of a sheriff , whether here as Wade Addams , or as the lead character in " The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp " . Can you believe that series is over fifty years old ? For a Western that follows a fairly standard formula , director Gerd Oswald provides some interesting scenes that were never staples of the genre . Like young Tom Gipson ( Robert Burton ) getting shot off his horse , or how about that fancy showdown in the saloon when the Sheriff takes out all three Barlow brothers ? That scene came off as totally realistic , vindicating Addams ' tarnished reputation in bringing outlaw Tris Hatten ( Burr ) to justice in the first place . Even the ending was done differently , instead of your standard showdown in the middle of a dusty street , you have both antagonists riding toward each other like jousting knights , but with guns blazing instead . There seemed to be just the right amount of satisfaction in Hatten's dying breath as he figures he outlived the hangman . But you know , I keep wondering about one scene . How many takes do you think it required for Burr to find his mark when he threw his holstered gun against the wall ?
367612	2707735	31322	7.0	" Well that's that , no use crying over split milk . "	It's been years since I watched a Laurel and Hardy film , but viewing " Flying Deuces " was a great reminder of just how brilliant they were . The nuance of their performances is particularly poignant to an adult viewer , whereas watching them as a kid , they were just funny . On display are Ollie's trademark necktie flutter and Stan's inimitable crying jag , but there's so much more to savor here that transcends their brand of humor . Of particular note is the soft shoe routine the boys break into as Ollie croons out a very satisfying rendition of " Shine On Harvest Moon . I don't know how often they danced in their films , though I recall a similar routine as a highlight of " Way Out West " . Later in the film , Stan plunks the springs of a jail house bunk that evolves into a wonderful harp number , forcing me to check the film sleeve to be sure this wasn't a Marx Brothers show - Harpo would have been proud ! The story is almost secondary , as it is with most Laurel and Hardy movies . Here the boys sign up for the French Foreign Legion when their Paris vacation ends with Ollie's marriage proposal being rejected by the lovely Georgette ( Jean Parker ) . Her husband Francois ( Reginald Gardner ) unwittingly talks them into joining the military without realizing how that plan will backfire on him personally . The boys create such havoc that six weeks of furlough goes to anyone who captures them . Fans of Laurel and Hardy will no doubt recognize and enjoy James Finlayson as their put upon jailer . There aren't many actors who can do as good a job of caricaturing themselves ; his expressions are priceless . One has to wait till the film is almost over to understand how the title fits the story . Trying to escape the Legion , the boys take to the skies in a hilarious flight in an old barnstormer . The film's ending made me realize I did see this one once before . Who can forget the mustachioed horse wearing a derby , Oliver Hardy's reincarnation of choice following their crash landing . It had me wondering if here in fact was the inspiration for Mr . Ed .
368507	2707735	402260	7.0	" What matters is the man inside the skin . "	Lou Diamond Phillips does a fine job portraying a half breed ex-convict recently released from a territorial prison in this Hallmark Entertainment film from 2004 . He's got a couple of guardian angels in the form of Marshal Luther Toll ( Lee Majors ) and old timer Eugene Lawson ( Ernest Borgnine ) . Borgnine in particular seems to be having a heck of a time in his role , alternately challenging town boss Samuel Drigger ( Warren Stevens ) and confiding in a determined Keenan Deerfield ( Phillips ) trying to stay out of trouble . Trouble finds Deerfield though , and most of it revolves around his relationship with Christine Beckford ( Marina Black ) , who at the beginning of the story tries to make the best of her almost daily beatings at the hands of Drigger henchman Gerald ( Richard Tyson ) . The film's flash point occurs when Gerald is killed , but it's not Deerfield who's riled to action ; Christine's trigger finger finds it's mark during an alcohol induced attack . Because Deerfield's been framed for a payroll robbery , he's got problems of his own to attend to , but it doesn't take long to sort through the villainy and arrive at a happy ending . If the period details are accurate , Deerfield wouldn't have been able to hire an accountant to manage his ten dollars a month pay at Drigger's , all neatly calculated to wind up back in the mining boss's hands via rent and equipment to work in his mines . It kind of makes you realize that maybe the good old days weren't . Try as I might , I couldn't establish the actor under the whiskers and black hat of Marshal Toll as Lee Majors , to me he was unrecognizable . His relationship to Deerfield could have used more development as far as back story goes , but he was there when it counted to make the save in the showdown finale , and without even firing his gun . Credit the film makers with tying it all together at the end to make sense of the title . Christine's daughter is named Hope Rose in deference to old timer Lawson's deceased wife Rosie who he often talks to during the story , combined with a hope for the future . It's classic Hallmark and for this Western , it works .
367590	2707735	64409	7.0	" There'll be no killin ' around this church unless I do the killin ' . . . . Amen " .	After watching quite a few Westerns with the cattle vs . sheep rancher theme , this is the first time I've ever seen one in which an attempt was made to get the two factions together by demonstrating that both animals could live together side by side . I wonder why no one else ever got that idea , until Glenn Ford came around as preacher / gunman Jim Killian . Pastor Jim plays it fairly straight down the middle for the picture's entire run , cleverly inviting the opposing forces to join his congregation while they try to settle their differences . I have to give some casting credit here to the roles of John Anderson and David Carradine as father and son , positioned as the main heavies to oppose Pastor Killian . The younger Beck had almost as good a resemblance to his movie father as he did to his real dad , John Carradine . It makes me curious now if the Carradines in question ever did portray themselves as father and son . There's also decent support work here with Noah Beery Jr . as a Beck henchman , and Carolyn Jones and Barbara Hershey in somewhat adversarial roles for the affection of the good pastor . It's not played that apparently , and Killian seems to be above it all , but the picture could easily have gone in either direction . I'm always impressed with the expressiveness of Indian names ; Hershey's character was a Hopi Indian named Leloopa - ' Life From Faraway Star ' - very mysterious and romantic . Hey , how about that scene where Pastor Jim blasts Beck henchman Mace ( J . D . Cannon ) in that under the table gunfight . It had all the earmarks of Greedo vs Han Solo , but done eight years earlier . Can you imagine that ?
367701	2707735	42286	7.0	" Maybe some day you will kill me or I will kill you ; we will not spit on each other . "	I guess I've seen enough of Jimmy Stewart's ' normal citizen ' movies ( " It's A Wonderful Life " , " The Phladelphia Story " , " You Can't Take It With You " ) to make it seem unlikely that he could play a strong lead as a Western hero . But he made a number of them , and I have to say that his performance here is every bit as professional and workmanlike as some of his better known roles . The story of " Broken Arrow " is somewhat based in historical fact , but as with many , if not most Hollywood treatments , there's also a fair amount of poetic license taken with the characters and situations . A little bit of quick research reveals that Cochise was fifty five in 1870 when the story took place , making him somewhat older than the real Tom Jeffords , who would have been thirty eight , approximating Jimmy Stewart's age at the time of filming . What's fairly accurate is the role Jeffords played in bringing about a negotiated peace between the U . S . Government and the Chiricahua Apaches in 1872 , at least for three short years before the treaty was broken , leading to a decade long hostility that ended with Geronimo's surrender in 1886 . While it appears that Geronimo and Cohise were both part of the same Apache tribe in the movie , Geronimo was actually born to the Bedonkohe Apaches . His association with Cochise occurred when his chief Mangas Coloradas sent Geronimo to get help from Cochise to fight the Mexicans ; Mangas Coloradas ( Red Sleeves ) was the father-in-law of Cochise . I was quite surprised to see how closely Jeff Chandler resembled the real Cochise in a photograph from the era . In the film , he had that regal kind of bearing that one associates with great chiefs , as attributed by Jeffords ' Apache language teacher - " His eyes will see into your heart , he is greater than other men " . I was also surprised to learn after the fact , that Jeffords became a blood brother to Cochise , and wondered why it wasn't mentioned in the film . As for Geronimo , I'd have to say that this was the strongest acting role I've seen yet for Jay Silverheels , completely eclipsing the ' Me Tonto ' treatment reserved for the Lone Ranger's sidekick . His speech to Cochise defying peace with the whites was exceptionally well done and convincing . Historically , Geronimo never considered himself a chief , though he was highly regarded as a military and spiritual leader of the Apaches . Obviously , I can't finish without mentioning the exquisite appearance and performance of the White Painted Lady , Morningstar Sonseeahray , as portrayed by Debra Paget . I wonder how Stewart felt performing opposite a sixteen year old actress ? Her poise reminded me of Audrey Hepbun's own somewhat miscast appearance as an Indian woman in 1960's " The Unforgiven " . " Broken Arrow " has earned it's reputation as one of the first , if not THE first Western to treat Native Americans with humanity . It does so credibly , and is particularly revealing in Jimmy Stewart's voice over narrative following the early encounter with the wounded Apache boy . Stewart's character is a stand up guy all the way , even in the face of fierce opposition from neighbors and friends . It was with careful consideration that Cochise was able to guage the measure of Jeffords ' character with the words - " This white man is my friend " .
368130	2707735	42324	7.0	" OK Coach , where's the field and who do we play ? "	With some minor plot revisions , " Chain Lightning " would just about qualify as a remake of Humphrey Bogart's 1936 film , " China Clipper " . In both stories , Bogey's character is a former military pilot who takes on a civilian job as a test pilot for demanding bosses . Raymond Massey portrays the owner of the Willis Aircraft Company , a role performed in the earlier film by Pat O'Brien . Both men are hard driving , ruthless individuals who put work and success above having a personal life , whose ambition test the people around them , including the Bogey character . The minor difference might be in the romantic interest for Bogart ; in ' Clipper ' there was none , here he's on again , off again with Jo Holloway ( Eleanor Parker ) in a romance that tests one's patience throughout the film . I don't know when the device was first used , but in this movie , the opening scene serves as the introduction to a flashback narrative that winds up back at the same point later in the film . The bookends are fairly successful in delivering a complete story , but left this viewer wondering how much of it was based in fact . A reference was made to breaking the sound barrier by Chuck Yeager's earlier 1946 flight , and it seems that the story builds on technological advances in the history of military flight building up to the invention of the ejector pod . Bogey's conflicted character is in it for the money right up to the point he hears his buddy's voice recorder message detailing how he lost his life in a failed test of a ' JA-4 ' experimental craft . Will he or won't he ? If it means hurtling back to Earth to be with his one true love Jo , all systems say go . I must say , I was a bit dismayed by Colonel Matt Brennan's ( Bogart ) post war job prospects . He's shown running his own flight school and charging customers three dollars an hour for the privilege . When a novice crash lands his only plane , it's time to look for more meaningful possibilities . What he's offered at Massey's company turns out to be seven hundred fifty dollars per MONTH ! The good old days swung both ways . Humphrey Bogart and Raymond Massey worked together once before in the 1943 war adventure " Action in the North Atlantic " . Interestingly , Bogey was top billed in both films , while Massey's character was his boss in both . Sometimes things just work out that way . As mentioned earlier , the film doesn't elaborate on events portrayed when it comes to accuracy . Obviously the ejector pod was someone's good idea at some point in time , but the way it's presented here would have meant more in a historical context . Even so , this viewer was kept interested enough by events in the film , even if the romantic angle between the principals seemed forced . Perhaps the film makers couldn't decide between Bogey landing his girl the easy way or the hard way .
368024	2707735	48158	7.0	" Maybe he died from laughing at old jokes . "	There's a great politically incorrect sign hanging in the Amato Club House that says - " Be American , Speak English " . That's one of the visual treats in " Hell On Frisco Bay " , a gritty gangster drama featuring one of the best , Edward G . Robinson as tough guy Victor Amato . There's also a lot of great dialog compliments of Robinson's character , especially the prayer conversation with henchman Joe Lye - " Guess those prayers went into a separate account for lover boy " . Alan Ladd portrays Vic Amato's nemesis in this one , playing it fairly deadpan , almost tired , throughout the story . He's an ex-cop just released from San Quentin following a stretch for a murder frame up , and he's out for vengeance . A pal from the old days , Dan Bianco ( William Demarest ) , is about the only one he can confide in as he goes after the bad guys . Come to think of it , Demarest plays it entirely straight in the picture too , he's usually good for a few comic relief moments in most films , but not here . He knows enough to back off too , when Steve Rollins ( Ladd ) makes it known he's got a score to settle . The tension between Rollins and Amato is allowed to fester and build as the former detective conducts his personal investigation , reaching the boiling point when Vic summons his adversary to a meeting . Ladd delivers one of the movie's best lines when he turns down Vic's job offer of two hundred dollars a week - " I'd like to kill you so bad I can taste it . " Not too much room for miscommunication there . Joanne Dru portrays Rollins ' not quite ex-wife , having had a quick affair while he was in the cage . A nice surprise in the film for me was the appearance of Fay Wray as a retired actress ; you know , she really aged wonderfully in the two decades following " King Kong " . It's too bad she was relegated to a career of ' B ' films even after her Kong triumph . Also on hand in an early screen appearance is Rod Taylor , described as a ' tough monkey from up North ' , who takes his orders from mobster Vic . For his part , Robinson turns in one of those quintessential gangster performances that he's known and caricatured for , particularly vile here for ordering a hit on his own nephew . With Robinson , you get so much more than you bargained for with all those little nuances he throws into a role , like the way he sizes up the door man at the apartments , or how he sets up Joe Lye's hit right in front of a statue of St . Anthony . And when he goes down , he goes down hard , sneering all the way as the cops fish him out of Frisco Bay following that wild speed boat chase . As for the film , it's an OK little story that could have packed more of a punch without the color format . I would have preferred the movie's noir-ish ambiance in glorious black and white .
367691	2707735	31149	7.0	" If you did do it , I'm all for you . That woman had at least one murder coming to her . "	" Charlie Chan in Reno " offers a cleverly woven mystery in which the murder suspects are all revealed to have had some involvement with each other in the past . It helps when watching to keep a scorecard to keep track of events and relationships so the final revelation makes sense . Not only do we have a murder victim , but an attempted murder as well . When Mary Whitman ( Pauline Moore ) is found over the dead body of Jeanne Bentley ( Louise Henry ) , she of course is the obvious suspect , and with a firm motive ; Bentley was going to marry Whitman's about to be ex-husband . But Bentley had a unique way of alienating most everyone with her ingratiating manner , not the least of which was another suitor , Wally Burke ( Robert Lowery ) . Burke comes across as suitably suspicious , as does Dr . Ainsley ( Ricardo Cortez ) , who is surprised to be discovered in the murder room of the Hotel Sierra , claiming to be looking for the money won by Bentley at the casino , offering robbery as the motive for the crime . Charlie Chan ( Sidney Toler in his second performance as the Oriental Detective ) is aided in the case by Number # 2 Son Jimmy ( Victor Sen Yung , credited as Sen Yung ) . Jimmy is on spring break from the University of Southern California , and gets himself mugged by a pair of con men who steal his borrowed car ; he's identified by " Pop " in a police line up . There's also Police Chief King ( played straight by Charles D . Brown ) and an inept Reno Sheriff Tombstone Fletcher ( Slim Summerville ) . Fletcher is quick to dismiss Chan's serious questioning and investigative work , preferring to pin the crime on the innocent Mary Whitman . Once Charlie gets down to business , a whole host of new clues and information come to light . The investigation eventually leads to an abandoned ghost town outside of Reno , and yet another suspect , this time Jeanne Bentley's ex husband George . For trivia fans , there are two actors in " Reno " that also appeared in Toler's first Chan adventure in " Honolulu " . Phyllis Brooks as Vivian Wells is ultimately revealed to be the murderer ; while Eddie Collins does a comic turn as the talkative cab driver . Collins was the lion keeper aboard a freighter in the " Honolulu " film . Before the mystery is over , Chan unravels an entire network of entanglements that connect the murder victim with each of the suspects , and the suspects with one another . It's rather cleverly done , and promotes this film to one of the better Charlie Chan titles , particularly those of Sidney Toler .
368420	2707735	68657	7.0	" Don't worry ma'am , I only kill nice people . "	There's a great DVD set put out by St . Clair Vision that offers nine films , appropriately titled " Spaghetti Westerns " , and fairly oozing garlic oil and marinara . If you're only familiar with the Clint Eastwood ' Man With No Name ' films , you'll be intrigued and entertained by the offerings here , among them " The Grand Duel " . Lee Van Cleef stars doing what he does best , as a calm lawman on the outside with a seething vengeance on the inside . His character is a former marshal , but you're never really sure about that until he produces a star , and even then it's questionable . The only other Western I can think of that offers a homosexual character is " Little Big Man " , and in that picture it was an Indian . Here , one of the Saxon Brothers is an overtly limp wristed , white suited desperado with a silk scarf for added effect . The fact that he's a ruthless gunman is almost beside the fact , his pock marked face is worthy of a seamy horror flick . The three Saxon Brothers are out to avenge the death of their father , and numerous flashback sequences that offer the darkened outline of the killer point to only one person , and yet when Sheriff Clayton ( Van Cleef ) reveals it was himself , it almost comes as a surprise . The Saxon's had fingered rival Philip Wermeer ( Peter O'Brien ) for the murder of the Patriarch ; Wermeer's own father in turn had been murdered over his ownership of a silver claim . Early in the story , it appears that Clayton's quarry is Wermeer , until they team up following the apparent killing of Wermeer by bounty hunters - neat twist ! If you're used to the Eastwood style of the genre , you might find the circus type acrobatics of " The Grand Duel " to be somewhat off base , but it seems to be standard fare in some of the other films on the collection I mentioned earlier . Here it's Philip who entertains with some improbable flying maneuvers , but it does make for highly innovative action sequences . Also pretty clever was the game of checkers at the Saxon City saloon . Played with glasses of whiskey , it seemed to me that the winner would be the guy who got drunk first ; after all , you had to down your shot after jumping the opposition . I would swear I'd heard portions of the musical score in another film , it's so provocative you find yourself actually anticipating some it . There's a definite Ennio Marricone influence , though here it's provided by Sergio Bardotti and Luis Bacalov . Quite definitely another reason to tune in . " The Grand Duel " is definitely one to sample , coming out near the end of the Eurowest cycle . Be prepared for marshals in business suits and the not so subtle portrayal of a gay bad guy , but also keep an eye out for the new patriarch David Saxon sporting the same dimple in the middle of his chin as the portrait of his father hanging on a wall . If that weren't enough , I'd say the bartender at the Saxon saloon was one gay caballero too !
368386	2707735	114622	7.0	" Nobody dies till I tell ' em to die . "	I've probably seen James Caan more often as a villain than a hero , and the villain role suits him just fine . He goes from bad to evil to maniacal in the course of the story here , with a twist in the picture that comes out of nowhere that attempts to explain his hatred of the half breed Hudson Santeek ( Christopher Lambert ) . That he's a half breed himself serves no purpose other than to cause this viewer to go " Oh ! " , so I don't know why that element was even introduced . While watching the film , I hearkened back to my childhood days with ' Sergeant Preston Of The Yukon ' ; this could have been an extended episode of that show . Great footage of Alaskan sled dogs mushing through wind whipped snowy trails , not quite figuring out how competing sled teams didn't get all tangled up with each other . One thing Preston never had to put up with was getting shot and falling into icy rivers . Man , I can't imagine even being THAT cold ! I wonder if the actors got bonus pay for that . I caught this on the Encore Western Channel this evening , and I suppose the ' Western ' connotation has some bearing , even if filmed as an Alaskan wilderness adventure . It's got a typically ' B ' Western flavor focusing on an evil town boss ( Caan ) swindling local miners out of their gold claims and leaving them dead in his wake . I can't think of a Western that ever got the body / deed count as high as eleven like this picture did , which can only mean that Christopher Lambert was no Red Ryder or Durango Kid . For his trouble , the man should pour himself a brandy to warm up .
367883	2707735	27113	7.0	" He who filters your good name steals trash . "	I'm always learning something new when I research a film on the IMDb , like how this Laurel and Hardy short was a sequel of sorts to " Them Thar Hills " . So now I'll have to search that one out to round out the experience . When I watch anything with Stan and Ollie in it today , I have to marvel at just what a pair of comic geniuses they were . As a kid , I always preferred Abbott and Costello , but I realize now that that with A & C , they did funny things , but Laurel and Hardy did things funny . As an example , just check out the timing involved whenever they leave Hall's grocery store and eat one of his cookies . They start out very simply and wind up after three or four tries in an increasingly complex choreography that's just brilliant to watch . There's also the misdirection with the pilfering customer in Stan and Ollie's electrical supply store , who starts out on foot and winds up hauling the entire store away in a moving van . With the boys none the wiser , they carry on their feud with Hall in an escalating series of comic encounters . And how about Ollie getting away with that line to Hall's wife coming down the stairs from the bedroom - " I've never been in a position like that before " . I would never have picked up on that double entendre as a kid , but boy oh boy , it was right out there in plain sight for the alert viewer to pick up on and and go ' huh ? ' . In any event , just about any Laurel and Hardy short offers as much entertainment as anyone else's full length feature , so taking in three or four at a time can only quadruple your fun . And by the way , why is it you never hear about alum any more ?
368556	2707735	53221	8.0	" If I'm going to get shot at , I might as well get paid for it . How do I get a badge ? "	Not only is " Rio Bravo " one of the greatest Westerns ever , but it's about the most fun you'll have watching one too . For that , you'll have to credit an eclectic casting decision matching Dean Martin as a drunken deputy with the Duke himself , and nineteen year old teenage heartthrob Ricky Nelson as a sharp shooting gunslinger who throws in with the good guys . Round it out with Walter Brennan's finely tuned stereotypical turn as a real McCoy deputy sheriff and you've got the ingredients for an entertaining Western . And oh yes , I don't want to forget Angie Dickinson as the romantic interest for Sheriff John T . Chance ( John Wayne ) , but at twenty eight , she didn't look like the kind of girl who'd go for the fifty two year old Duke , looking more like ten years older . I think if you play the picture in your head without her , you'd still have a decent outcome , even if someone else had to throw the flowerpot . Say , could you have picked two better Western character actors than Claude Akins and Myron Healey to challenge the Dude ( Dean Martin ) with the old coin in the spittoon trick ? You know , they weren't on screen very long , but if you follow the genre as a fan , it's always a kick to pick out the players in even the most minor roles . Then there's John Russell , someone I'll always remember first as the " Lawman " , but for some weird reason , I think I like him better as a villain . Trouble is , his screen time here wasn't nearly long enough to establish a sinister presence like the role of regulator Stockburn in Clint Eastwood's " Pale Rider " a couple of decades later . Still , I'll take him in a heartbeat if it means facing down the guys in white hats . The only thing that really catches you off guard in the story is when the good guys are holed up at the jail , and Dino breaks into song accompanied by Rick Nelson on guitar . Roy Rogers used to do that a lot too , even when he was behind bars ! It's a nice diversion even if not very believable , especially when Stumpy ( Brennan ) knows the words to the song too ! I guess what makes the picture work above all is the way Chance stays behind his guys through thick and thin , even when it looks like he's throwing them over . Especially effective are the scenes with Stumpy , played for comic effect , but always with some introspection and wise advice laid in between the lines . On the surface , it's not the kind of team you'd select if you were choosing sides for a pick up game , but when the dust settles , it's the one you'll have the most fun with and still win the game .
368048	2707735	349467	8.0	" . . . God's grace is sorta like retroactive . . . "	The unique quality of " Freedomland " lies in the fact that the film consistently leaves something just out of the viewer's reach , just as Julianne Moore's character does the same in her relationship with detective Lorenzo Council ( Samuel L . Jackson ) . The film is unnerving enough with the drama of a potentially abducted child ; it serves up additional tension with it's backdrop of strained race relations at a New Jersey housing project . In that respect , the movie may in fact be more about how not only different races see each other , but how different economic classes within the same ethnic community relate to each other . It's a precarious tightrope on which the film is balanced , and is made especially heart breaking when the lost child's fate is eventually revealed . Jackson is effective as ever as the black man in the middle , but the performance of the film has to be that of Julianne Moore . At times , the viewer must consider whether she's back on drugs , psychotic , having a mental breakdown , or just flat out lying . The mental anguish and pain etched on her face throughout the story makes her a believable character , and quite sadly reminds us that there are real people out there in the world suffering through the same type of ordeals , self inflicted or not . " Freedomland " is not the type of film you watch for entertainment , but once involved in the story , you find yourself straining to pick up that missing link that will make the entire story fall into place . Once it does , you'll feel no better for having solved the mystery , for as in real life , one doesn't always come away with a happy ending .
368164	2707735	41038	8.0	" Yes Tonto , I am . . . . The Lone Ranger . "	Bullets may not have bounced off his chest , but The Lone Ranger was every bit the symbolic icon to me as my other boyhood hero - Superman . He represented truth , justice and the American way in a classic TV Western setting , living by the principle that he would never use his gun to kill , while scouring the American Southwest with his faithful Indian companion Tonto to bring every single outlaw to justice . The advent of TV provided the perfect opportunity for a post War generation to find it's ideal in an enigmatic masked man who stood for law and order , while providing unparalleled entertainment for five seasons spanning almost eight years . Today I had the opportunity to view for the first time the complete three part origin episodes start to finish without the standard opening and closing sequences to interrupt the continuity of the story . For fans of the Ranger , this is the grand daddy of all Western sagas , telling as it does how Texas Ranger John Reid survived the ambush by the Butch Cavendish Gang , and how he was nursed back to health by an Indian friend from his childhood . Tonto ( Jay Silverheels ) declares his companion a ' trusty scout ' , and names him Kemo-sabe . I've read various interpretations of the origin of the term Kemo-sabe , but I'm satisfied with Tonto's explanation . Reading too much into it just detracts from the story , just like the English translation of ' tonto ' from Spanish , which I won't reveal , because it's just better not to know if you can help it . I thought it quite clever how the origin story created the mystique of the Lone Ranger , like the sixth grave that created the illusion that all the Rangers died in the box canyon ambush . You never see the face of the man who becomes the Lone Ranger , as it's always turned away or obscured to hide his real identity . Even the origin of Silver is handled brilliantly ; the voice of the story's narrator describing the wild stallion's sterling qualities . Would that relate , say , to sterling . . . , silver ? I got the biggest kick out of that . Of course with the passage of time , watching the Lone Ranger episodes today offers a view of how unsophisticated the show was beyond the origin story . Some of them are almost embarrassingly goofy , particularly when it comes to a Lone Ranger showdown when he shoots into the middle of a crowd of bad guys to knock a gun out of it's owner's hand . And how about that little wave he gives to Tonto whenever they're about to ambush the bad guys - it's always the same gesture , but Tonto always knows what it means in different circumstances . Then you have the episodes where Clayton Moore takes off the Ranger mask to don a different disguise to impersonate another character in service to the story . He even went under cover once as an actor portraying President Abraham Lincoln to uncover a villain , top hat and all ! Few fans that I come across ever know that actor John Hart replaced Clayton Moore for the season in a contract dispute that Moore had with the show's producers . If you ever saw that " Happy Days " episode where Fonzie idolizes his boyhood hero , you'll notice it was John Hart listed in the credits . It's difficult actually , to tell if you're watching a Hart episode or not , the key is to listen to the voice ; Moore's is so distinctive that it's a dead giveaway . If you ever get the chance to sample some of the final season color episodes , you're in for a treat . The renditions I've seen on VHS are absolutely gorgeous , although I don't know if commercial prints are available . Most of the black and white episodes around have been re-packaged by any number of distributors in different configurations , so getting your hands on those should be no problem . The must see of course is the three part origin , and if you don't watch anything else , this gives you all the flavor and excitement you need to capture the imagination of one of the West's most famous heroes . Hi-Yo Silver , Awaaaay !
368578	2707735	22913	8.0	" Gooble gobble , gooble gobble , one of us . . . "	I caught the Hilton Sisters in 1951's " Chained For Life " a couple weeks ago , and while researching that film , I was pointed in the direction of Tod Browning's " Freaks " . I had heard of it before of course , but hadn't realized that the picture dated back to the early 1930's . MGM's Irving Thalberg wished to capitalize on the popularity of horror films of the era , one of which was Browning's year earlier take on the all time classic " Dracula " . The studio already owned the rights to the short story " Spurs " by Tod Robbins on which this movie was based , and had the active interest of Lon Chaney Sr . in bringing the story to film before he died in 1930 . It goes beyond saying that this is a picture that won't appeal to everyone , but at the same time I don't think you have to suffer from voyeuristic tendencies to find it gripping . Unless you grew up in the Depression era ( and that leaves most of the current population out ) , you wouldn't ever have seen such a large collection of human anomalies on display in one place at one time . My own experience of growing up in the 1950's allowed me to sample a mere shadow of these holdovers from a prior era at the local county fair , but sadly , they were of the half man / half woman and ' man eating chicken ' variety - not ' true freaks ' in the sense of the word that the title offers here . Needless to say , the movie became a lightning rod for Hollywood backlash groups when it first came out , who also targeted the sudden popularity of gangster films . Although the picture did well in major cities like New York , MGM didn't want to take it on the financial chin with wide release , and pulled it from their calendar . The picture was actually banned for almost three decades until the counter-culture of the 1960's revived the picture in this country . After all , if you considered yourself a hippie-freak and found all things ' freaky ' to your liking , it was inevitable that a picture with the same title would find a new audience . Too many other reviewers on this board have retold the picture's main plot , so instead I'll offer my impressions of the characters . I think I found Johnny Eck the Half Boy to be the most interesting . I couldn't get over how easily he scrambled from place to place , maneuvering stairs and obstacles as easily as you or I can walk on flat ground . I found Prince Randian , the Human Torso to be truly disturbing . I know , I know , I'm trying to be as objective as possible about this , and maybe that's one of the confounding things about being ' normal ' . Who's to say that any one of us has the authority to proclaim what's normal ? You know , I've seen a wide variety of films in all genres , but I don't think any single one ends as creepily grotesque as the final attack on Cleopatra ( Olga Baclanova ) in one of the picture's final scenes . Under the dark of night and crawling through the mud , the image of a dozen mis-shapen but determined attackers is enough to create a week's worth of nightmares . You have to remind yourself that this isn't modern day CGI or some other kind of trick photography or special effects wizard at work . I'd watch it all over again if I didn't have to get some sleep tonight .
367845	2707735	96487	8.0	" Get ready for hell ! "	I've always enjoyed watching this movie , and with my most recent viewing I followed up with the episode of ' Billy The Kid ' from the three disc ' Gunfighters ' DVD collection from Nonfiction Films ( 1998 , listed as ' Gunfighters of the West ' in the IMDb database ) . It was pretty surprising to see how closely the film followed real events in the life of The Kid , born Henry McCarty in New York City's Lower East Side in 1859 . All the business with John Tunstall ( Terence Stamp ) and Alex McSween ( Terry O'Quinn ) is based in fact , although the real name of the Jack Palance character was Jimmy Dolan . He was a real life businessman ( read that town boss of Lincoln County ) who was challenged by Tunstall for rights to government contracts at Fort Stanton in the New Mexico Territory . Dolan headquartered his ' Company ' at an establishment named the House of Murphy , hence the name Lawrence G . Murphy used in the picture . The ensuing Lincoln County Wars , often depicted as a range war , was in fact a mercantile war fought essentially over the right of one faction to make more money than the other . I've often wondered whether the real life Billy would have been as maniacal as the way he was portrayed by Emilio Estevez . I would almost think so , but with the kind of charisma that made him entirely likable as a person to those who knew him well and called him friend . Estevez , along with his brat pack buddies have an engaging chemistry on screen , even if most of it is spent dispatching members of Murphy's thugs . If not for Estevez's pacing of the character , the tone of the film would have been entirely different , as most of the men gunned down in the course of the story were simply murdered to avenge the death of Tunstall . My favorite scene had to do with the gunslinger in the saloon who Billy mocked into a gun-down . I'd consider that one of the fictional elements thrown into the story to highlight just how duplicitous the real life Kid could be . Did you notice how the gang reacted instinctively to back up their leader just in case ? I'm not as familiar with the sequel to " Young Guns " as the original . Both were written by John Fusco , so I'd expect that the continuity relative to historical accuracy is similarly maintained . Over forty films have been made about the legend of Billy the Kid , along with the blatantly contrived two season TV Western " The Tall Man " from the early 1960's . Your best bet apart from the documentary mentioned earlier , while maintaining an element of entertainment , would be tuning into " Young Guns " .
368087	2707735	26643	8.0	" You're my prisoner you know , I couldn't let you out of my sight . "	The epic scope of the film is particularly impressive considering it's release in 1935 , and without the complexity of today's computer generated effects . Director Henry Hathaway relocates his experiences with the American Wild West to the more exotic locales of northwest India above the Khyber Pass . There he focuses on the good natured rivalry between Lieutenant Alan McGregor ( Gary Cooper ) and two newly assigned junior officers , Forsythe ( Franchot Tone ) and Stone ( Richard Cromwell ) , members of the 41st Bengal Lancers . The plot is thickened by the authority of Colonel Tom Stone ( Guy Standing ) , father of Mr . Stone from Sandhurst , immediately creating a dynamic tension between familial and military concerns . There's a bit more to it than that as well , weighing on the Colonel's mind are an impending retirement and the responsibility of his assignment to protect the Indian Emir from a coalition of hostile tribes led by Mohammed Khan ( Douglas Dumbrille ) . His ' service comes first ' mentality is repeatedly tested by Cooper's character , who refers to the Colonel as ' old ramrod ' ; in fact , McGregor is probably one of the most insubordinate officers in film history if you count the number of times he disobeys orders . The younger Stone is at odds throughout the story as to how to impress his overbearing father . The boar hunt goes badly , and later he falls victim to the Khan's kidnap plot , utilizing the wiles of the sultry Tania ( Kathleen Burke ) . Ultimately he earns his redemption , but at a high price , as the officer trio reunites to destroy Khan's stolen ammunition supply . That he didn't have the courage to resist torture like his comrades is inexorably relived during the presentation of the Distinguished Service Order , when he has all he can do to hold back his welling tears . Any story set in India probably wouldn't be complete without the obligatory dancing cobra scene . Here it's done to somewhat comic effect when the bantering Forsythe finally receives his comeuppance from the older officer McGregor . Of course as with most films , this one doesn't get it scientifically accurate either . Cobras are not enchanted by the music they can't hear , but the swaying motion of the player and his instrument ; for his part , Forsythe looked a bit too terrified to sway . Curiously , Canadian born Douglass Dumbrille has just the right look to be plausible as a foreigner . His character here exudes both charm and malice , and he would go on to portray a varied assemblage of international characters in film . One that immediately comes to mind was a comic turn in the 1950 team-up with " Abbott and Costello in the Foreign Legion " . As a fan of the classics , I have a preferred taste for black and white films , but every once in a while there's a scene that simply begs for the color treatment . As guests of the Emir , the Lancers are shown in full ceremonial regalia which look quite stunning . Kind of makes you wish for a modern day remake , if only they would stay away from the CGI .
367650	2707735	42369	8.0	" I don't think you fully understand Mr . Bigelow , you've been murdered . "	I've known about this movie for years but only got around to watching it today ; I wish I hadn't waited so long . The film grabs you right from the outset , as Edmond O'Brien's character Frank Bigelow rushes in desperation to unravel the mystery behind his own murder . At first , I thought the luminous toxin ordeal was a contrivance invented for the film , but the movie closes with an assurance that such a poison actually exists . One learns something every day . There are some great scenes in " D . O . A . " , not all of which are critical to the plot . The jazz riff at The Fisherman in particular is especially enjoyable , sweat gleaming off the brow of the frenetic trombone player and his fellow musicians , a " jive crazy " moment worthy of comment by the bartender . This is where it all starts , as Bigelow is slipped a mickey by an unknown figure who we'll recognize later by his curiously identifiable upturned collar . The see saw nature of Frank's frantic search is personified by his race through the streets of San Francisco at breakneck pace . I wonder how many takes were needed to complete that entire piece , O'Brien doesn't look to be in that kind of shape . The crux of the plot involves a bill of sale that accountant Bigelow notarized some six months earlier . Entirely insignificant at the time , the paperwork can exonerate a businessman of a fraudulent transaction if it can be produced . In an ironic twist of fate , the iridium that changed hands in the transaction is now responsible for Bigelow's impending doom . Besides O'Brien , memorable performances are turned in by Pamela Britton as his needy girlfriend Paula Gibson , and Neville Brand in a greatly over the top turn as a henchman for a low life named Majak ( Luther Adler ) . Brand's character Chester is just brimming with a malice that oozes , there's none of the subtle Peter Lorre type hostility here . As for Paula , her clingy personality made it entirely reasonable why Bigelow needed to take a week vacation without her in the first place . Though we know the actual outcome of the story right from the start , one can't help hoping that something will dramatically occur to rescue Bigelow from his plight . But it can't be any more final , as large block letters " D . O . A . " are stamped on his case file at the film's close . I'm just glad we didn't have to deal with Paula's reaction when she learns the news .
367631	2707735	61418	9.0	" We rob banks " .	I just watched this film again , forty years after seeing it for the first time . The first thing that struck me was - holy cow ! - where did that forty years go ? ! ! As regards the picture , I thought that maybe with just the most minor of tinkering , it very well could have been made today . If so , it might not have passed the blood and gore test that seems to be a staple of modern films , but considering that it was made back in the day , this was pretty wild stuff for the late 1960's . The movie helped usher in a new genre of violent films juxtaposed with humor , and was one of the first to treat it's protagonists , though remorseless criminals , as anti-heroes who one might actually root for in their Robin Hood personas . I didn't really remember a whole lot of the picture from seeing it back in 1967 , having completely forgotten the roles of the supporting players , Gene Hackman , Michael J . Pollard , and Estelle Parsons . Pollard popped up in a lot of films during this period , generally in roles like the one here , owing no doubt to his eccentric look and manner . He could wind up anywhere and usually did , perhaps gaining his greatest notoriety as Little Fauss to Robert Redford's ' Big Halsy ' in the picture of the same name . Say , when you first see the shirtless C . W . Moss , that tattoo of a lady seemed to be on his stomach , but in the scene at the campground after Bonnie and Clyde are shot , that tat appeared to have drifted up to his chest - check it out . I never really felt strongly about Warren Beatty , but I have to say , he put a lot of nuance into the character of Clyde Barrow . The best scene to portray that would have to be when he first meets Bonnie Parker . Just watch as he works the matchstick in his mouth , exuding a cockiness that just begged for Bonnie to touch his gun . There was more pent up sexuality in that scene than a lot of films are able to convey in twice the amount of time . But then the picture does a complete one eighty , as Clyde is unable to perform in the romance department in scene after scene . The one hint to his sexual preference comes across in that card game scene when he hunches up close to C . W . , but then nothing more is made of it . So in that regard , the picture drops the ball a bit , when much more could have been explored in regard to the frustration Bonnie experienced each time she tried to close the deal . Yeah I know , they did get to finally do it , but Bonnie seemed to be just a little too understanding along the way . It's funny sometimes how my timing with certain pictures winds up mirroring current events in the news . Seeing the poster of ' FDR For President ' comes on the heels of that Joe Biden gaffe about a week ago when he talked about Roosevelt going on TV to calm the country during the Great Depression . Of course Herbert Hoover was president in 1931 , and there was no TV . As for Clyde Barrow , he seemed to have some problem with the press at the time because they didn't report his exploits properly - can you imagine ? Anyway , this is a great picture on a number of levels - as a period piece with some outstanding scenes of 1930's city life and all those wonderful old automobiles , as well as a precursor to later pictures pushing the envelope with violence and brutality . The final scene is actually quite jarring even today , particularly when it's a woman who's getting rubbed out by the authorities . Not a scene for the faint of heart , especially as it's prolonged for maximum effect , and played at various speeds to heighten the emotions of the viewer . It's one of those scenes that's easy to remember , even after forty years .
368483	2707735	105236	9.0	" Alright ramblers , let's get ramblin ' . "	" Reservoir Dogs " is a blast and a half . Quentin Tarantino's non linear method of telling a story keeps one viscerally engaged , almost as if you were really there like a fly on the wall with a direct view of the proceedings . It's a style that works without being confusing , even if you have some misgivings about following the story ; and even if you do , a second viewing clears that up completely . Nor is Tarantino concerned about disposing of characters off screen , as he did with Brown ( Tarantino himself ) and Blue ( Eddie Bunker ) . The technique tends to put even more focus on the surviving characters attempting to come to grips with their situation . As far as that goes , don't even concern yourself with following the Colors , it doesn't make much difference who's Brown , Blue , or Blonde , the players are so fully convincing you'll get wrapped up in their narratives as each contributes to the total package . Then as the pot simmers and comes to a boil , the result is a new kind of gangster film that Bogart and Cagney couldn't even imagine . I wasn't aware of how much a comic book fan Tarantino must be , he helped guest direct 2005's " Sin City " of course , but here he peppers his film with Marvel Comic references to the Fantastic Four and The Thing , and a Silver Surfer poster pops up from time to time . It's interesting to see how a pop culture fan integrates his favorites back into the genre , completing a cycle of sorts . As a fan of both mediums , the combination adds another layer of enjoyment to the experience . With a film like this , I can understand that there's really very little ground in the middle for viewers , you're probably either going to love it or hate it . For someone like me who's actually rather conservative , I find that anything Tarantino is involved with to be a unique and action packed joy ride . For a directorial first effort , " Reservoir Dogs " is an amazing piece of work , lulling you into a comfort zone with the opening diner scene , and then hammering away at your senses until that last fateful gunshot . No need to fill in any blanks here .
367748	2707735	54997	9.0	" Hey John , you think this boy's a hustler ? "	It's always fascinating when a movie transcends the concept suggested by it's title . In this case , one has to wonder who was the greater of the two hustlers , Fast Eddie Felson ( Paul Newman ) or slick Bert Gordon ( George C . Scott ) . Set in the seedy , not yet professional venue of high stakes pool , the film becomes a taut psychological drama played out between it's principals , ending in an unanticipated ' contract of depravity ' suggested by Eddie's pick up girl friend Sarah ( Piper Laurie ) . With that in mind , the character of Minnesota Fats ( Jackie Gleason ) becomes almost a secondary player , which of course couldn't be further from the truth . The film balances itself with almost equal weight on each of the four central characters , with an ebb and flow that makes you forget how truly depressing the story actually is . For that reason , it's a classic piece of movie making that deserves to be mentioned in conversations of the top films of all time . Somehow I found myself comparing Newman's Fast Eddie to Marlon Brando's Terry Molloy in " On The Waterfront " , an underdog determined to prove himself in a world that finds it easy to honor winners and discredit losers . The distinction often lies in the self confidence and mental toughness of the person competing for honor and recognition . By the time Eddie takes on Fats in the finale , one can sense the shift in attitude of the three high stakes rollers , done with nothing more than facial nuance and body language ; in this case the game is over when the fat man sings . Outstanding performances and excellent black and white cinematography capture what might almost be considered film noir but without a subversive criminal element . Yet the story does have it's victims , most eminently Lauirie's character at a point in the story when she's reduced to complete vulnerability . In fact , each of the principals is a victim in one way or another , in a film that allows it's protagonist to attain the goal he sets out with , but without anyone actually feeling very good about it .
367562	2707735	22286	9.0	" Remember this boys , you gotta have friends . "	This movie offers the quintessential Cagney , by the lamp post in the rain , a tense close up that signals the arrival of a star . It was only his third film , but what an impact he had . The movie would be great even if it came out today . Of course , James Cagney would have plenty of time to polish up his gangster image , his turn as Rocky Sullivan in " Angels With Dirty Faces " is one of my all time favorite characterizations . " The Public Enemy " allows both Cagney and Warner Brothers to sharpen up their story telling skills , but even for 1931 , this is a powerful tale . Unlike ' Angels ' , boyhood friends Tom Powers and Matt Doyle both take up a life of crime as an answer to the easy way up and out of poverty . Told in crisply dated vignettes , the film progresses through the Depression and World War I as it offers Tom ( Cagney ) and brother Mike ( Donald Cook ) taking separate paths under the watchful eye of Ma Powers ( Beryl Mercer ) . The movie has more than it's share of defining scenes , most viewers will identify with the Mae Clarke grapefruit smackeroo , but there are a lot more . The black cat crossing Putty Nose's ( Murray Kinnell ) path as the boys renew their acquaintance is just the best harbinger of bad luck , culminating in the off screen gunshot that screams revenge . It was Putty who taught the gangster trainees about honor and loyalty , but in reverse . Also , how about the quick exchange of a thousand dollars to bring a race horse to justice for accidentally killing mob benefactor Nails Nathan ( Leslie Fenton ) . The coal chute cover for the rapid staccato of machine gun bullets was another inspired piece of work , culminating in the very real artistry of a skilled shooter taking it out on a cement wall . Following Tom's confrontation with the Schemer Burns gang , again off camera for the viewer to fill in the blanks , director William Wellman wryly uses Ma Powers to signal his final return home . With strange premonition , she utters - " You're comin ' home , aintcha Tommy , to stay ? " His arrival is one of the all time shocker finales of film history , a perfect dichotomy between the visual and the sound accompaniment to the strains of " I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles " . What an ending ! Warner Brothers begins and ends this tale with a warning and an exhortation , signaling the public enemy as not a single man or character but a problem that the public must solve . Seventy five years later they could still be putting the same captions into their films , as each generation finds a way to deal with it's own brand of criminal enterprise . But here in the early days of sound cinema , James Cagney set a high mark that was ever rarely challenged for gangster supremacy on screen .
368440	2707735	338751	9.0	" There's too much Howard Hughes in Howard Hughes . "	Watching the film today for the first time , I found myself fascinated by it , but not for the reasons I thought I would be . As a teenager in the 1960's , I was aware of this character named Howard Hughes , the billionaire recluse who made a vast fortune in the aviation business . What I wasn't aware of , nor was the rest of the world , is that Hughes spent a lifelong battle against mental illness following the tragic crash of one of his experimental airplanes . I don't recall ever reading about or hearing a reference to his Obsessive / Compulsive Disorder , which made the revelation in the film to be so intriguing and fascinating . Though the film glossed over his personal relationships while he was going through this , I really wonder what it must have been like for his close friends and business associates to see him go through this agony . When I first heard about Leonardo DiCaprio's casting as Hughes , I thought to myself ' no way ' , that doesn't even make sense . Watching the movie , it still didn't make sense , until I watched a documentary about Hughes showing him in clips from the era in question , the late 1920's to the late 1940's . Back then , Hughes didn't even look like Hughes , at least the Hughes that I can remember from newspaper photos during the late 1960's . In the scenes that depict the man's descent into madness , DiCaprio appears to transform into a reasonable facsimile of the aging , reclusive genius . Anyway , not being particularly a DiCaprio fan , I thought he did an excellent job in his portrayal , a tribute to his exhaustive research into the life of his subject . I don't pretend to know anything about the filming techniques involved in producing this movie , but I thought it unique the way it opens with a bluish / aqua cast to the scenes for a good part of the first half . At first it was somewhat distracting , especially during the dinner scene with the blue peas , but later I learned it was meant to simulate the Technicolor process available at that time in Hughes ' life . As the movie progresses , it takes on a more realistic color rendition , director Scorsese's bold way of marking movie-making progress through the years . I suppose I should mention Cate Blanchett's portrayal of Katherine Hepburn . It only took hearing a couple of sentences to realize that she sounded dead on for the late star , while capturing the look and mannerisms in an eerily accurate way . There has always been something just out of reach for me in trying to understand why I didn't like Hepburn as a person . With Blanchett's portrayal , I now know why , and I think it has to do with what Hughes figured out . She seemed to be acting out her life instead of living it . For Hughes fans interested in the aviation side of the story , there's a lot of that too . I was particularly impressed with the inventor's clear vision for the future of commercial air travel , and the depiction of the rivalry against Pan-Am President Juan Trippe ( Alec Baldwin ) . The tense scene during the Senate hearings conducted by Ralph Owen Brewster ( Alan Alda ) was nearly identical to the real thing from a news clip I viewed of the actual event . On balance , I'd have to say that watching the film was an entirely worthwhile experience on a number of levels . Entertaining it was for sure , but I came away with a much better understanding and appreciation for a legendary character that many will only know as a name in history . Kudos to all involved with this project , which manages to be entirely absorbing , even to the smallest detail .
368172	2707735	22100	9.0	" Just you wait , it won't be long , the man in black will soon be here . . . "	I was taken aback somewhat by the physical appearance of Peter Lorre as Beckert ; I had pictured him more like the scheming character Ugarte from " Casablanca " or the sinister henchman Joel Cairo from " The Maltese Falcon " . In " M " , he appears almost like a man-child , a roly poly round faced character who doesn't fit the profile of a child molester or murderer . Perhaps that was the point , to make him appear harmless until that creepy window scene where he wipes his lips and swoons with his evil desires while contemplating his next victim . Lorre brings out the evil in Beckert gradually over the course of the story , culminating in that agonizing appeal for mercy before the criminal underground at the finale . That in itself was a unique device for such an early talking picture , the question of whether a child murderer should be turned over to the police by a band of criminals or dealt with privately in vigilante fashion . Adding the third layer of a vagabond beggar society was also an interesting device , keeping the focus of the story at street level as it were , as the beggars used a host of ruses to keep their target in sight . It appeared to me that director Fritz Lang in this , his first talking picture , tried to maintain a link to the silent era with a number of extended scenes that relied on no sound at all . I found it almost distracting during one of the street scenes , since it seemed like it could have been a flaw in the filming rather than an intended result . Particularly since the silence drew attention to itself at the expense of expected background noise simulating street activity . The re-emergence of sound then was more like relief that the film was back on track , even if it was all the while . The other element that seemed overdone was Beckert's whistling that couldn't help but draw attention to himself . It seemed too convenient for the blind balloon man to make the connection with Beckert and Elsie Beckmann based simply on that circumstance . If it was intended to represent a subconscious desire on the part of Beckert to be caught , then that idea wasn't explored satisfactorily . Probably not , but it's interesting to consider . It's also curious to consider the similarities between this film and Lang's silent masterpiece " Metropolis " . Both utilize underground locations and capitalize on mob mentality . The tag line of " Metropolis " states that ' there can be no understanding between the hands and the brain unless the heart acts as mediator ' . Cleverly , the character of Hans Beckert exists with no understanding between his murderous hands and a sick twisted mind , and no mention at all of a non-existent heart .
367928	2707735	299977	9.0	" How swift your sword must be . "	When I first saw " Hero " during it's original American theatrical release , I was mesmerized by the brilliant use of color and exceptional cinematography . I've thought about that visually stunning display for a long time , even after forgetting what the actual story was about . I decided to watch it again for the experience , this time finding my interest intrigued by the complexity of the tale . Perhaps intended for the viewer to arrive at his own conclusions , the sequences as recounted by Nameless ( Jet Li ) and refuted by the King of Qin ( Daoming Chen ) are nothing less than spectacular , a work of magic by director Yimou Zhang . In the special features section of the DVD , Zhang relates how he tried for years to find a successful treatment on the history of his subject . Failing , he decided to do the screenplay himself to capture the vision he had of the unification of the warring states . Reading other knowledgeable reviewers ' recaps of that history has been enlightening for me , and helps to understand the dichotomy in the motives of the films ' principals . Much like " Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon " , I like to think of this movie not as a martial arts film , but a film with martial arts in it . Both successfully put behind them the era of action Kung Fu flicks that often seem more caricature than believable , more over the top than entertaining . Political and humanistic considerations aside , " Hero " makes for landmark storytelling , handled with deep conviction and reverence by it's creator .
368521	2707735	28096	9.0	" This is Duke Mantee , the world famous killer , and he's hungry . "	When you hear it said that " they don't make movies like that anymore " , you can rest assured that " The Petrified Forest " fits into that category . Though set in the sparse , almost barren confines of Black Mesa , Arizona , the film comes to life with sparkling and intelligent dialog that underscores it's mission to give meaning to the lives of it's two protagonists - Allan Squier ( Leslie Howard ) and Gabrielle " Gabby " Maple ( Bette Davis ) . Squier is a " tourist afoot " , hiking his way across the desert to the Pacific Ocean , when he finds himself in an out of the way diner populated by it's owner Jason Maple ( Porter Hall ) , daughter Gabby , Gramp Maple ( Charley Grapewin ) and an itinerant gas jockey named Boze ( Dick Foran ) . Most will find the film's tension in the presence of escaped killer Duke Mantee ( Humphrey Bogart ) , on the run from the law , and with his gang the object of the " greatest manhunt in history " . Delving deeper , it's the conflicting world views expressed by Allan and wistful dreamer Gabby that deliver the film's resonance , even as the immediate life or death threat of Mantee's muscle overtakes the film's second half . " There's something in me that wants something different " is Gabby's lament to Allan , he a world traveler who has given up his dreams as a writer and poet . Penniless , he seems almost trapped in a futile existence , though his brief visit to the Black Mesa Bar-B-Q will soon offer a grand moment of glory . Gabby magically and quickly finds herself head over heels in love with Allan , finding him worldly and intelligent , though to him , intelligence is " brains without purpose " . Squier's presence deflates the ego of Gabby's would be boyfriend Boze , who effectively delivers the film's defining comment when viewed in retrospect - " Everybody's entitled to their own way o ' thinking " . With a handful of films already to his credit , Humphrey Bogart finally gets his hands on a meaty role in the figure of Duke Mantee . By the time his gang makes it's way to Black Mesa , you know he's the man in charge . So does Gramp Maple , who's prior brushes with celebrity include Billy the Kid and Samuel Clemens . Though generally not taken seriously by his diner companions , he's vindicated by the appearance of the Duke - " You can't tell a killer except by his chin " . For his part , Bogey affects an odd posture , one that won't be seen again in any other film ; he bows his arms across the front of his body in an almost ape like stance giving added menace to his authority . Earlier , Mantee and his cohorts hijacked the vehicle of a wealthy businessman named Chisholm ( Paul Harvey ) . Representing industrializing America , he's everything his wife detests , hating herself for a loveless marriage and denouncing his timidity in the face of danger . As Allan and Gabby share a passionate conversation , director Archie Mayo poignantly frames their face to face encounter around the background features of Mrs . Chisholm , dramatizing the lost purpose and vitality of a woman who gave in to her family's wishes instead of her own . Ultimately , Allan Squier strikes on the one defining idea that will give his life some meaning and purpose , he will sign over his five thousand dollar life insurance policy to Gabby so she can use the proceeds to return to France to live out her artistic dream . To make it come true , Duke Mantee will have to kill Allan . Mantee has no qualms about the proposal , but has no personal quarrel with Allan and seems rather to almost enjoy his company . Squier must force the issue , so that " As long as I live , I'll be grateful to the Duke " . " The Petrified Forest " covers a lot of ground , and even manages to reflect on racial constructs in the exchange between the two black men in the film . Slim Thompson is Duke's driver , but a man in his own right freely challenging and offering advice to his boss . On the other hand , Chisholm's chauffeur Joseph is typecast as the subservient employee , who has to ask permission to have a drink when offered by Slim . The scene lasts only a few seconds , but long enough for the symbolism to jump out and grab the viewer . Having just viewed " The Petrified Forest " for the fourth time , I'm even more in awe now of the film's powerful story and the director's deft use of it's principals and supporting characters . There's not a wasted moment , and every scene seems to have a purpose , even if it's a rolling tumbleweed across the desert landscape . They just don't make them like that anymore . Bette Davis made her film debut in 1931 in " The Bad Sister " , a movie that also included Humphrey Bogart . The two would team up again an incredible five more times by 1939 , in order - " Three On A Match " , " The Petrified Forest " , " Marked Woman " , " Kid Galahad " , and " Dark Victory " . Davis was top billed each time over Bogey ; oddly Bogart usually wound up in supporting roles in most of his Warner Brothers films when teamed with fellow contract players Davis , James Cagney and Edward G . Robinson .
368357	2707735	40506	9.0	" You were right , when your head says one thing and your whole life says another , your head always loses . "	Repeat viewings of " Key Largo " will only enrich your appreciation of it . The superb cast and directing by John Huston make this a must see film for fans of the 1940 classics , particularly fans of stars Humphrey Bogart , Edward G . Robinson , and Lauren Bacall . Bogey and Bacall made four films in a space of four years , this being their final appearance together . Bogey's character , retired Army Major Frank McCloud seeks out the family of a war buddy killed in action . He finds Nora Temple ( Bacall ) and her father James Temple ( Lionel Barrymore ) as the owners of a seasonal hotel in Key Largo , and comes to realize that all is not quite right in the serene setting . Bogey's response to an inquisitive Nora Temple is about to be tested - " Life on land has become too complicated for my taste " . Edward G . Robinson's appearance as mobster Johnny Rocco is suitably delayed in the film to build suspense , and he breaks on screen with all of his classic nuance - the sneer , the braggadocio , the " What's with you wise guy ? " sarcasm . Rocco suffers from a fall from past glory , a time when he was regarded as " the one and only " , a virtual emperor of the crime world . Now he's a two bit hoodlum , holed up in a Key Largo hotel , hoping to cash in on a counterfeit money scam . With him are a coterie of henchmen , and an alcoholic moll superbly portrayed by Claire Trevor , earning a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance . Johnny Rocco is desperate to make a mob connection to unload his counterfeit money stash , and refuses to submit to the might of an impending hurricane . Fueling Rocco's desperation is a stoic Bogart - " You don't like it Rocco - the storm ; show it your gun why don't ya , if it doesn't stop , shoot it ! " . Helpless in the face of the coming storm , Rocco's anxiety mounts , and in a tense scene he confronts war hero McCloud by throwing him a gun to force a showdown . But Bogey's not buying it - " One Rocco more or less isn't worth dying for " . In a damned if you do , damned if you don't situation , McCloud must decide to man a boat to Cuba for Rocco's gang to make a getaway . In the one improbable scene of the film , Trevor's Gaye Dawn character secretly maneuvers Rocco's gun away from him and slips it into Bogey's hand , while surrounded by all of the bad guys . How Rocco would not have missed his weapon ( until later on the boat ) is an element that is not suitably dealt with in the film . McCloud's resourcefulness while skippering the getaway boat is sheer cunning , taking out one mobster after another with surgical precision . The desperate Johnny Rocco even shoots one of his own men rather than have his authority challenged . McCloud remains silent to Rocco's taunts , causing the gangster to force his own hand and become a target for the heroic McCloud . As Bogey heads back to port and the hurricane fades , the film ends on a feel good note as Nora Temple opens the shutters of the hotel and the sunlight streams in - all is well in the world again ; the symbolism is extraordinary . Bogey and Robinson appear in four other movies together ( Kid Galahad , Brother Orchid , The Amazing Dr . Clitterhouse , and Bullets or Ballots ) , but this is the only one in which they share equal footing , Robinson cast in the lead role in the other films over Bogart . For Robinson fans , the Clitterhouse film is a blast and is recommended to see him in an offbeat role . Another point of interest for film buffs , Jay Silverheels appears in an uncredited role as Tom Osceola , one of the Seminole Indian brothers on the lam from the law in the movie's back story . For an actor as typecast as Silverheels ( Tonto in the Lone Ranger ) , it's always a pleasant surprise and treat to see in an entirely different setting . " Key Largo " ranks right up there with " Treasure of the Sierra Madre " and " The Maltese Falcon " , and perhaps just a notch below " Casablanca " among Bogart's finest films , and a true classic worthy of the name .
367817	2707735	44081	9.0	" Well I guess I'm gonna strike you as being the unrefined type , huh ? "	Marlon Brando has always been one of my favorite actors , " On The Waterfront " is on my personal Top Ten list . However I'm just getting around to some of his very early work , " The Wild One " being a recent example . In " A Streetcar Named Desire " , Brando strongly impresses , but not as one might expect from his first appearance on screen as a handsome , macho leading man . His character here isn't much more than a chauvinistic slug , a brutal bully when his buttons get pushed , and they seem to get pushed often . Stanley Kowalski is the kind of character that gives all ' Polacks ' a bad name , a term I use with some familiarity as my own name ends in ' ski ' . The movie itself has a feral quality , dripping with the steam and passion of a hot New Orleans night . It's best expressed in the relationship between Stanley and his wife Stella ( Kim Hunter ) ; some of their scenes together are downright lusty and passionate . The introduction of Stella's sister Blanche Dubois ( Vivien Leigh ) sets off a ticking time bomb that threatens and eventually does explode to bring the story to it's dramatic finale . Even on a first time viewing , it's easy to pick up on Leigh's theatrical roots in contrast to the acting styles of the other principals in the film . She's a difficult character to pin down , most times it's hard to know whether she's a sympathetic character or a manipulative one . Director Elia Kazan uses a variety of camera angles and lighting techniques to bring out the dichotomy in Blanche's persona , and she alternately appears lovely or haggard , sometimes within the space of mere seconds . It's really a wondrous characterization to behold . Note in particular a scene in the latter part of the story when Blanche reacts to Stanley complaining about steam in the bathroom . Her eyes roll into a hideous distortion as she reacts to Stanley's verbal assault ; it made me wonder from what depths Leigh was able to summon that guttural response . With all eyes on Brando and Leigh throughout the film , the roles of Stella and Mitch Mitchell ( Karl Malden ) seem overshadowed to a large degree , yet were strong enough to earn their respective players an Oscar win in supporting roles . I thought Malden was even better in " On The Waterfront " , but I guess timing is everything . This is quintessentially an actors ' movie , and you'll keep coming back for the performances again and again . Forget that ' Stellaaaaah ' film clip you saw in great movie highlights , what you want is the entire story that builds to that dramatic and stunning climax .
368082	2707735	409459	10.0	" In my opinion , the existence of life is a highly overrated phenomenon . "	In anticipation of the movie , I read " Watchmen " just about a month ago , it was my fourth time . Each time , I came away with a greater understanding of the characters and story , in no small part due to the extensive narrative offered as backup to the panels one most closely associates with the comic book medium . To enjoy the movie , I don't think it's a prerequisite to read the book first , but I will say this - a viewer going in cold will have no idea that some of the scenes in the opening montage preface events in the story , like the young Laurie Jupiter watching her mother argue with her then husband ( who wasn't revealed by name in the movie version ) . I think having that insight only brings a greater satisfaction to the viewer who has an insider's understanding of where the story is going . What most impresses me with the film adaptation was director Zack Snyder's attention to detail , reminiscent of the same way he approached " 300 " , another graphic novel by veteran writer Frank Miller . Granted , the ending , which many devotees of Moore will find fault with , is somewhat different from the original , but I was left entirely satisfied with the way the movie handled it . So much so , that I was left wondering why Moore hadn't come up with a similar ending himself , it seemed to make a whole lot more sense given the attention to Dr . Manhattan's self imposed off planet exile . Even in the graphic novel version , the alien creature construct ( ' the squid ' ) , seemed clunky , perhaps more so in the artwork then in the concept . I say this after the fact of course ; upon an initial reading , the story flows quite logically in regard to Ozymandias ' scheme to defuse tension between the world powers . What truly amazed me about the movie was how the entire back story of the characters meshed perfectly with events happening now , with no disconnect to the chapters of the original graphic novel . That , and the virtually perfect casting of actors for the lead roles . The only character that I had some trouble with was Matthew Goode's portrayal of Adrian Veidt / Ozymandias , I was expecting someone a little older and perhaps a bit huskier in physique . But Billy Crudup , Jeffrey Dean Morgan , Patrick Wilson , and especially Jackie Earle Haley were perfect choices for their characters . Put Heath Ledger's Joker up against Haley's Rorschach and I think you'd be hard pressed to come up with a clear winner . The role of Laurie Jupiter could probably have been handled competently by any number of current young actresses , but with all said and done , Malin Akerman did just fine . As for the run time of nearly three hours , I might be in the minority on this , but I didn't have a problem with the length and pacing of the picture at all . In fact , I'm looking forward to the extended version when it eventually comes out on DVD . I don't understand why movie goers seem to have a problem with anything much over ninety minutes or so ; for my money , as long as the quality matches the content , more is always better by me . I mean after all , I'm going to a film to escape for a brief time from some of the lunacy going on in the world , so keeping me in my seat for an additional hour isn't the worst that could happen . With minor nods to the present , the " Watchmen " set in the mid 1980's doesn't seem like it would be much different from a fictional universe set in the present day . I'm thinking specifically about the notion of super power rivalry over finite resources and energy supply , and the ever elusive concept of a just and lasting peace between the major players on the world stage . In that regard , I'm reminded of a similar theme at the center of a movie that came out more than a half century ago . In " The Day The Earth Stood Still " ( 1951 ) , the Earth's major powers were faced with the threat of annihilation from an alien source if they persisted in continuing a rivalry that might lead to nuclear annihilation . The Ozymandias solution , for all it's intended ' good ' effort to sacrifice millions to save billions , in the end would never achieve success for the simple reason posited in the graphic novel by Dr . Manhattan , and in the movie by Laurie to Dreiberg in a closing scene - Nothing ends , nothing ever ends . . . " For all his effort , Adrian Veidt achieved only a temporary goal .
367734	2707735	52618	10.0	" How do you fight an idea , especially a new idea ? "	The word that kept coming to me throughout my viewing of " Ben-Hur " was ' grand ' ; the film has a wondrous feel of grandeur even in it's most serene moments . The vibrancy of it's color comes through gloriously , perhaps in part due to it's treatment on the four disc DVD special edition . It's a film that one can easily use to describe the term epic , the type of movie that comes out perhaps once in a decade . I'm particularly impressed with the way director William Wyler managed to intersperse defining moments of Christ's life in a way that did not detract from the character of Judah Ben-Hur ( Charlton Heston ) . Those include the Sermon on the Mount and the washing of Pilate's hands as the Judean governor turned Jesus over to the mob . In those instances , Ben-Hur is shown consumed by the urgency of his quest to oppose Roman authority . He is not a direct witness to Christ's mission , yet those pivotal moments come full circle when Ben-Hur realizes that the man to be crucified is one and the same who showed him a kindness as Judah was marched off , condemned to be a galley slave in a Roman war ship . The scene in the movie that everyone calls to mind obviously is the chariot race . Magnificently staged in an era bereft of the kind of digital effects available today , the segment withstands the passage of time for excitement and believability . What I found particularly intriguing was the incredible stunt work that had it's birth in the early days of the Western film genre , most notably in the work of Yakima Canutt . To my surprise , Canutt's name appeared in the credits as head of the second unit , along with his sons who took up their father's mantle in the business . The scenes of chariot drivers falling victim to their reckless abandon has the indelible stamp of Yakima Canutt all over it , owing in large part to stunt techniques he developed back in the 1930's . But back to the spiritual message . Judah Ben-Hur's ultimate victory does not involve hand to hand combat with an enemy , or leading a citizenry to revolt against a tyrannical Roman governor . It has all to do with the quiet power of Christ washing away the world's sins along with the disfiguring leprosy of Judah's mother and sister ; the same power that compels Ben-Hur to give up his sword , instead of wielding it for hateful revenge .
368565	2707735	47296	10.0	" So what happens , he gets the title shot outdoors in a ball park , and what do I get , a one way ticket to Palookaville . "	Theatrical trailers are supposed to promote the movies they represent , but the one for " On The Waterfront " actually got it right - the ' one motion picture you must see ' . It's not just hype , this is masterful cinematic story telling at it's best with a flawless cast , led by Marlon Brando in arguably his career defining performance . My favorite movies tend to be about classic underdogs rising up against insurmountable odds , ultimately rising victorious , and in some cases as you have here , bloody but unbowed . This one will always be in my personal top ten . A lot of it has to do with the dialog , sharp and witty , directly to the point . As in this early exchange between a couple of supporting players : ( J . P . , Johnny Friendly's loan shark ) - " When I'm dead and gone you'll know what a friend I was " . ( Dugan responding ) - " Why don't you drop dead now so we can test your theory " . Once you've seen the picture once or twice , it's worth it just to go back and study Brando in his characterization of the young dock worker Terry Molloy . Virtually every one of his scenes is deftly nuanced , it all comes across so natural and convincing . The best of course is the gut wrenching car scene with his brother Charley ' the Gent ' ( Rod Steiger ) . For Terry , it's agonizing to know that he coulda been a contender , and you know Charley knows it too . Certainly the Academy knew it , proffering on Brando it's Best Actor award for his portrayal . In fact , Oscar found favor with the film in a total of eight categories , including Best Picture . One of the great things about these classic films is the perspective they give of simpler times in a bygone era . When Terry and Edie ( Eva Marie Saint ) discuss her schooling and where she lives , she describes Tarrytown as being in the country , a place Terry doesn't like because the crickets make him nervous . The last time I was in Tarrytown I would hardly be able to describe it as ' country ' , and it certainly didn't take a half century to get that way . " On The Waterfront " is one of those films that just get better with repeat viewings , and in my case , I try to do so annually . It's a treat just to kick back and enjoy each actor's performance and their contribution to the total package . Like the trailer says , it's a motion picture you must see .
368499	2707735	360717	10.0	" It was beauty killed the beast . "	It's rare for a movie remake to equal , much less surpass the original . Peter Jackson's " King Kong " is an exceptional film that stays true to the core of the original 1933 movie , embellishing it with rich color and dazzling the viewer with a frightening array of prehistoric monsters and even inventing some new ones . Once you land on Skull Island , be prepared for a non stop roller coaster ride and adrenaline rush scenes that will make you go " Wow " ! The film's opening almost makes you wonder if you're watching the film you set out to see . There's a wonderful montage of 1933 New York City street life , with the bright lights of Broadway sandwiched by shots of depression era poverty . The setting allows us to meet the principals in their natural element , Ann Darrow ( Naomi Watts ) is a struggling young actress thrown out of work by the chains thrown on the doors of her failed theater play . The always optimistic , yet scheming movie maker Carl Denham ( Jack Black ) comes to Ann's rescue by first offering her a meal , and then by offering her an adventure . Black's portrayal of Denham is much more of a conniving show man and outright liar than Robert Armstrong ever was . The 1933 version of Jack Driscoll seems to have been split into two characters for this film . There's the updated Driscoll ( Adrien Brody ) , a playwright who becomes enamored of Ann at first sight ; in the original film , Driscoll was a crew member on the ship . The addition to the cast was the inclusion of a leading man for Ann , Bruce Baxter ( Kyle Chandler ) , self absorbed to a fault and in love with his own image . Baxter's presence was rather useful , as his character had a role in the outcome on Skull Island , and he didn't get in the way of the romantic angle between Ann and Jack . Arriving at the waters of Skull Island , Denham wastes no time getting down to it . He's on a boat heading for shore while Captain Englehorn ( Thomas Kretschmann , another great casting choice ) is still wrestling his ship away from the dangerous outcrops surrounding the island . The inhabitants of the island are visually intimidating and savage , as much if not more so than the creatures we're yet to meet . The haggard old witch of the tribe utters only one recognizable word - " Kong " . Members of the landing party meet their fate early , as the savages size up Ann Darrow as a suitable sacrifice for their island god . From here on out , action takes over , with stupefying monster sequences following each other in rapid succession . Kong's initial appearance to capture Ann is almost tame by comparison to his battle with the band of Tyrannosaurus Rex's . What was accomplished via stop motion photography in the original is replaced here with CGI effects that offer a seamless array of hideous and gigantic beasts . In an ode to the earlier film , Kong dispatches one of his T-Rex opponents with the same jaw cracking guttural intensity that leaves one breathless . Adding depth to the film is a sensitive exploration of the relationship between Ann and Kong . While the 1976 remake seemed to suggest an almost laughable sexual chemistry between the characters , the new film uses humor effectively in a way one might not expect . Once Ann understands that Kong will not harm her , she sets out to test his personality with an exhibition of athleticism and dance , garnering the ape's attention . Kong's facial expressions and mannerisms are so lifelike and real , it's difficult to know when gorilla ends and Andy Serkis begins in his characterization of Kong . I was pleased to see that Jackson expanded on a scene in the movie following Kong's destruction of the log bridge connecting the two sides of the island . In the 1933 film , a deleted scene explored what happened to the survivors who fell off the bridge into the deep chasm below . Various explanations exist for the " spider pit " scene to have been removed , but here what happened is revealed in all too gruesome and yucky glory . Those of faint heart and stomach be warned , one of the crew meets his maker in a totally innovative way . As exciting as the jungle sequences are , the New York City adventure is equally up to the task of providing more thrills and suspense . It was a kick to see another tribute to the 1933 movie performed by native dancers on stage when Kong is first introduced to civilization . They wore the same type of outfits and danced the same routine as in the original . Kong's rampage in New York is dramatic and effectively done , particularly his escape from the theater , crumpling row upon row of seating in his blinding fury . As one would expect , there is no match for Kong on the ground , as he lays waste to all manner of vehicles . With news of his escape , Ann attempts to find and calm the beast . In a wonderfully creative scene , Kong is introduced to the concept of ice and snow , and for one brief moment we believe that maybe this one will end differently . The first sight of the biplanes however sets you up for the finale you already know is coming , with a feel that transports you back to an earlier era . Kong's defiance as he stands up to his tormentors will set the new standard for iconic images , while Ann Darrow invites us to shed a tear along with her , as the muffled sobs of some theater patrons around me confirmed . As Kong valiantly says good bye , Carl Denham pays tribute to the fallen " Eighth Wonder of the World " with a paraphrase of the Arabian proverb he used to introduce King Kong to a New York City audience - " It was beauty killed the beast " .
367976	2707735	42531	10.0	" I just want to be somewhere , don't you understand ? "	I've seen this Western a couple of times before , but today I really watched it . It's surprising to me that it's not mentioned in the same breath as " High Noon " and " Shane " as icons of the genre . Gregory Peck delivers a solid and respectable portrayal of a gunslinger willing to give up his weapons if only time and circumstances would allow him to do so . Instead , Johnny Ringo ( Peck ) is persistently challenged by young toughs with something to prove , thereby providing a lot of sudden unnatural deaths in his vicinity . Like " High Noon " , the film delivers a slowly mounting tension , not as ominous as that of Gary Cooper's classic , owing perhaps to the ease with which Ringo disarmed the three brothers on the way to Cayenne . Nevertheless , there's a sense of unease that pervades throughout , as minor sub plots intervene to focus on the gunfighter as well as the man . Ringo's relationship with Marshal Strett ( Millard Mitchell ) is particularly compelling , as the former outlaws discuss their lives , Ringo lamenting the road not taken . Curiously , this was the second movie within a week I've seen in which the main character , at thirty five years old , felt over the hill and feeling life had passed him by . ( The other - Warren William's title character in 1939's " The Lone Wolf Spy Hunt " ) . Interestingly , the movie offers it's share of humorous asides ; I got a kick out of Ringo's request to Mac ( Karl Malden ) to get his saloon helper un-astonished . The others usually came at the expense of the punks Ringo is forced to throw down with , as when one of the barber shop crowd asked Eddie ( Richard Jaeckel ) if he could have his saddle if things didn't go well . Then there's Hunt Bromley ( Skip Homeier ) - " Well he was never much fun to have around anyway " . There's also the reaction to the marshal's declaration that Ringo's son Jimmy was partial to Wyatt Earp . The best though had to be the women's citizen committee getting to meet Mr . Ringo , just a well crafted scene bringing out the nuance and dichotomy of Peck's character . Unlike many of the posters for the movie on this board , I never got the impression that Peggy Walsh ( Helen Westcott ) was married to Johnny Ringo at the time of his arrival in Cayenne . That she called herself Mrs . Ringo at the funeral was a way for her to vindicate a life led in secrecy for which she now holds no shame or remorse . I guess one could look at it either way , but not once did any of the characters close to either ever hint at their being married , certainly Marshall Strett or Molly ( Jean Parker ) would have known . All in all , I felt this was a finely written story that deftly handled it's principal characters , even though the finale proves ultimately tragic for it's hero . One identifies with the marshal , who admonishes the cowardly Hunt Bromley with - " Get killed somewhere else " . Ringo , before he dies might have been even tougher on his killer , advising the punk that he'll eventually get exactly what he deserves .
367925	2707735	44706	10.0	" People gotta talk themselves inta law and order before they do anything about it . . . "	" High Noon " has always been one of my favorite Westerns , heck , it's one of my favorite films altogether . The theme music stays with me for days after each viewing , not such a bad thing , though my humming does grate on the rest of the family . My unofficial count after today's viewing caught eight instances of the theme interspersed with scenes from the movie , not counting the complete rendition offered at the opening . Director Fred Zinneman broke ranks with many Western film traditions in his approach to this classic , and concentrated on three main ingredients to build suspense in the story . The threat imposed by the returning Frank Miller was continually reinforced by the still shot of the looming railroad tracks on which the villain would arrive . Marshall Kane's ( Gary Cooper ) repeated requests for help would be summarily turned down by virtually everyone in a town that feared for each individual's personal safety . Thirdly , the repeated use of the clock image , beginning at 10 : 40 A . M . , is used as the countdown mechanism to herald an impending confrontation ; it's use helps build suspense right up until the fateful steam whistle sounds at high noon . The reason fans can relate to Gary Cooper's take on Marshal Kane is a movingly human one - he can admit that he's scared . Yet there's that gnawing sense of duty to service and facing one's challenges that surfaces and takes over to drive Kane toward his destiny . That doesn't mean that Kane can't despair when his only ally deputy Herb ( James Millican ) backs out . Sure , John Wayne might have handled it differently , but that character would have been a caricature . Kane was about to face his mortality , and it wasn't a rosy picture . One thing did puzzle me though . Once the showdown began , the first time Kane is fired upon by an off screen gunman , the bullet strikes the side of a barn about a foot over his left shoulder . At the same time Kane grabs his upper left arm as if he was wounded . His shirt from that point on is torn as if damaged by a bullet . The ballistics involved for that scenario just doesn't work , the bullet would have had to bounce off Kane's arm in an impossible trajectory . I got a kick out of Lloyd Bridges ' recollection of the fight scene in the stable between his character Harvey Pell and Kane . Lloyd's son Beau was six years old at the time and he wanted to witness the filming of the scene , so dad hid him in the hayloft above the stable . When Cooper doused Bridges with a pail of water at the close of the scene , Beau burst out laughing , and they had to shoot it all over again ! Upon repeat viewings , you might pay attention to some of the nuances that give the film even more subtlety and substance , like the look Helen Ramirez ( Katy Jurado ) gives Harvey when the Kane's ride back into town , or the barber regarding the number of coffins the town has on hand . I got a kick out of that actually , note the sign in the barber shop offering ' Complete Funeral Service and Undertaking ' . Nice touch . For it's effort , " High Noon " took home four Academy Awards , led by Gary Cooper's Best Actor . It's theme music was rewarded with a Best Original Song along with a Best Scoring Oscar . Not too shabby for a genre traditionally overlooked by the Academy . For me , " High Noon " is one of those pictures that I like to bring out about once every year or so just to keep me focused on what good , tight story telling is all about . It's a classic underdog tale that ranks right up there with films like " On The Waterfront " , and " To Kill a Mockingbird " , as the lone protagonist finds the will to rise to the occasion and stand up for what's right . For Western fans , it stands alongside " Shane " as one of the best of the genre , without using a lot of complex techniques to explain itself .
367737	2707735	82096	10.0	" Now it all turns psychological , gentlemen , "	The more films I view , the harder it is to dole out a rating of ' 10 ' , and I've never been liberal about it anyway . With " Das Boot " , I have no such reservations . Here's a film that takes all your preconceived notions about Nazi villains and stands them on their head , by portraying a World War II submarine crew as human beings , facing life and death daily in the cramped confines of an underwater prison . Not only does one come to understand their plight , but sympathize with them as well , to the point of hoping that they make it through their Atlantic ordeal . The only problem being that once they do , a cruel fate intervenes to usurp the lives of innocents in a way that their harrowing underwater ordeal could not . Perhaps part of the reason that one identifies with the German cast has to do with the treatment of Adolph Hitler in the story . Not once was he identified as a Nazi hero or figure of respect . Early in the film , the Captain ( Jurgen Prochnow ) himself establishes his posture as less than a fan of the Fuhrer . The much later scene of the celebration in Vigo painted an even more resolute snub of Hitler by the officer crew of U-96 , along with their elite German hosts . It is possibly the only time I've witnessed anything less than outright undying loyalty to the Nazi leader by members of the Party . Told from the German point of view by director Wolfgang Peterson , the story opens with the staggering statistic that only twenty five percent of Germany's forty thousand submarine sailors ever made it home alive . By Autumn 1941 , the battle for the control of the Atlantic Ocean was turning against them , ominously conveyed by the Captain himself - " Those Brits don't make mistakes anymore " . It's stated not in anger or defiance , but as a statement of fact , one which further emphasizes the plight of this enemy sub . Men crack under the pressure of battle , as personified by Johann ' the ghost ' ( Erwin Leder ) , who has a nervous breakdown before he can be of use to his Captain one last time . So fascinating is Peterson's direction , that the entire time the sub lies doomed on the ocean floor , this viewer finds himself saying a prayer along with the crew for that one unbelievable miracle that might pull them through . Through it all , I maintained such an alert focus that I managed to catch a continuity error . When Lt . Werner ( Herbert Gronemeyer ) returns the packet of letters to Ullman ( Martin May ) that he volunteered to forward to Ullman's pregnant girlfriend , it was only half the size of the original bundle . Prior to seeing this movie , it would have been hard to imagine a war film to be as compelling that hadn't been produced by Hollywood . However by any account , " Das Boot " ranks up there with not only the best war stories ever told , but one of the best movies ever committed to film . It deserves a strong recommendation .
368086	2707735	30993	10.0	" Ah , ah , ah , now there your are , you've got to stop thinking in terms of fortune . "	Nearly forty years ago , I had the role of Kolenkhov in my high school's presentation of " You Can't Take It With You " , and it took all that time to get around to seeing the Oscar winning film today . Watching it brought back some great memories , along with a question . How is it that this film hasn't achieved the type of recognition accorded to " It's A Wonderful Life " , also directed by Frank Capra ? Both explore similar themes with stellar casts , and defined life's simple values against a backdrop of big business greed . One can only wonder . What's not hard to understand though is how quickly the Sycamore Family grabs you with their zany lifestyle under patriarch Grandpa Vanderhof ( Lionel Barrymore ) . He's clearly the voice of reason in the maelstrom of a New York City neighborhood in the shadow of Wall Street . He's also the conscience of a community that comes to rely on his status as the lone holdout against a major munitions manufacturer that wants to buy up the block for a new business enterprise . As daunting as that task sounds , it's the subtle and sometimes not so subtle subtext that comes across more forcefully in the day to day life of the Sycamore home . At any given moment , different members of the family take center stage , each with their own unique personalities precariously balanced above a basement filled with home made explosives . When the inevitable Fourth of July demonstration finally erupts , you've already been conditioned to accept it as just another day with Grandpa Vanderhof . Though most of the movie followed along the lines of the play as I remember it , there was a great additional scene in the park with Tony Kirby ( James Stewart ) and Alice Sycamore ( Jean Arthur ) where the local kids teach them how to do the ' Big Apple ' . As a couple , you just knew Alice and Tony were destined for each other , no matter what the script threw their way . And what a gold mine of supporting players ! Edward Arnold as the magnate Kirby , Mischa Auer as Russian ballet instructor Kolenkhov ( It steenks ! ) , Spring Byington , Dub Taylor , H . B . Warner and most surprising of all - Eddie Anderson as household servant Donald . He and Lillian Yarbo were generally afforded dignity in their roles as domestics , though there was an unfortunate ' boy ' reference thrown at Donald along the way . Even after all this time I was still able to pick off lines before they were spoken , and couldn't help recalling classmates that filled each role . It was especially a moving way to recall my best friend at the time who portrayed Grandpa Vanderhof ; he received standing ovations at each performance . I found myself wishing he were watching the movie with me , but he passed away a dozen years ago . That added another dimension to the harmonica duet , a scene that already had enough poignancy to elicit a couple of tears .
368088	2707735	316356	10.0	" Most times a man will tell you his bad intentions if you listen , let yourself hear . "	I hadn't realized what a consummate actor Robert Duvall was until " Open Range " . When his character is on screen , one gets the impression that it's really Boss Spearman on display , a cantankerous trail boss with a lifetime's worth of defining right and wrong . His world view is based on honesty and integrity , and doesn't allow for sixteen year old card cheats . Charley Waite ( Kevin Costner ) is of similar stripe , but he shows it more liberally , by booting his card cheat hired hand into the river . Those who complain that the early scenes move too slowly overlook the profundity of the set up . A man doesn't leave his friends behind or take the easy way out . He can't abide a murdering dog who would murder his dog . Backed into a corner and forced to take a stand , one begins to understand that there are " things that gnaw at a man worse than dyin " . There's a defining scene for Costner's character as the men lie under the night time prairie skies . Charley's midnight confession about his murderous past takes on added dimension as the camera slowly pulls away to reveal his cartridge belt . It adds perspective to the final showdown ; Charley's role as strategist has him lay out the confrontation right up to the part where they might get killed . And then the bullets fly . But it's justice , not revenge , that tempers this gunfight , even when Boss has Baxter at his mercy he defers to his own advice to Charley earlier . Justice , not revenge . Both as a an actor and director , Kevin Costner seems to be a lightning rod for his projects . " Dances With Wolves " , and " Field of Dreams " have been equally applauded and derided by movie goers over the years , and " Open Range " follows that pattern . For my part , I found it to be a masterful story transcending it's Western genre formula , finding poignancy in it's tale of men willing to focus on what's right , not who's right .
368318	2707735	99348	10.0	" We've come far , you and me . "	It seems that films that achieve both critical and financial success , directed by successful actors will always gain their share of controversy . Mel Gibson's " Temptation of the Christ " comes to mind as a recent example , as well as Kevin Costner's " Dances With Wolves " . The critics may have their say , but Costner's 1991 Best Picture effort is epic in all of it's facets , from the gorgeous cinematography to the heartfelt saga of Native American peoples and their treatment at the hands of the white man . I'm constantly enthralled by the lyrical names of Indians ; this film offers Chief Ten Bears , Wind in His Hair , Stone Calf , Kicking Bird , and Stands With a Fist . Generally the names say something about a person's character or physical traits , certainly a lot more colorful than Smith or Jones . Even Indian language contains reverence for nature and life that is not found in most other tongues , and sadly so in an increasingly furious paced world . Lieutenant John Dunbar ( Costner ) learned this for himself when relegated to an abandoned " soldier fort " by a pants pissing , suicidal commanding officer at Fort Hays . His journey would be filled with physical demands and frustration attempting to communicate with his newly discovered Sioux friends , yet the relationship goes both ways , and the Sioux are in constant amazement at this soldier who " dances with wolves " on the prairie . One of the movie's great scenes and a favorite of mine as well is the one where Dunbar , Kicking Bird ( Graham Greene ) and Stands With a Fist ( Mary McDonnell ) attempt to teach each other their names . At least " Dumb Bear " didn't stick with the lieutenant . Set in 1863 , the movie does well not to mention any of the famous historical figures of the era from either race , as many films are prone to do . So we have no reference to Custer , Sitting Bull or Crazy Horse . Also unusual is the placement of a warring Pawnee raiding party in hostile opposition to the more peaceful Sioux tribe . Depicting their savagery in the attack on wagon driver Timmons ( Robert Pastorelli ) who pleads mercy for his mules , director Costner appears to be offering a balance to his film , showing that good and evil can be found in all races and cultures . The message running throughout the film is that taking the time to learn about someone who's different can be a life changing experience . " Dances With Wolves " can be viewed , understood and enjoyed on many levels , and it has aged well since it's 1990 release . It transcends it's Western genre limitations and offers the viewer a glimpse of what could be a better way .
