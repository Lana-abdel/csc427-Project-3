368415	2707735	75881	1.0	" Prepare yourself for a big surprise . "	My summary line above is an actual quote from the movie . The surprise of course is whether you ever make it through the entire flick . Let's see - 1977 , " Star Wars " , and 1977 , " Cosmos : War of the Planets " . One is a landmark movie that took sci-fi film making into the twenty first century , the other set back the progress of civilization for time immemorial . My question is - Is this movie about anything at all ? It's virtually an endless stream of darkened scenes where crew members of a space ship called ' MK 31 ' attempt to defeat an alien intelligence that threatens Earth . The alien intelligence actually states to Captain Hamilton ( John Richardson ) that it will conquer the galaxy when he repairs a bad circuit board . So what does he do - he repairs the bad circuit board ! ! ! ! The only redeeming factor for this mess is the go-go style space suits , all white with a red skull cap and trim that look particularly fine on the good looking female crew members . Other than that , this film goes where no film has gone before , and will stay there by the look of the comments already posted . Fortunately or not as the case may be , this was the last movie left to view of my fifty DVD sci-fi collection from Mill Creek / Tree Line Films . A bargain at about twenty five bucks , this is the kind of movie that demands a refund , even if it's only fifty cents .
368538	2707735	46066	2.0	" In the continuing war for survival between man and the hexapod , only another fool would bet against the insect . "	" Mesa of Lost Women " has two early hooks that make it seem that the movie is actually going somewhere . Even before any opening credits roll , there's the seductive scene with Tarantella ( Tandra Quinn ) using her nine inch nails on a hapless victim . The nails are never seen again . While in a mountaintop surrounded by desolation , Dr . Arana ( Jackie Coogan ) explains he's isolated the growth hormone of the anterior pituitary , the substance that controls the growth pattern of humans . The writers must have been so impressed with this line that they used it practically verbatim twice . You can turn off your player right there . The rest of the film implodes in a veritable nightmare of nonsense and head scratching goofiness . With monotone voice over narration complemented by inane dialog , and a soundtrack composed of an incessantly strumming Mexican guitar , the viewer is challenged beyond physical endurance . Hey , here's an idea . Maybe someone could develop a video game based on the concept of the dwarf heads that pop into view every few minutes to eyeball the stranded group on the mesa . At least Dr . Arana had the right idea . His experiments were successful in staffing the mesa laboratory with a bevy of Miss Universe contestants . Wow , didn't Tarantella's anterior pituitary go into overdrive during that dance at the Mexican cantina ? I was mesmerized until the guy on the phone says - " Sheriff , the body just got up and walked out of here . " Contrary to all leading indicators however , this movie does NOT make my Worst Ten list . For that , a film has to be so egregiously bad that you can't even make fun of it . " Mesa of Lost Women " at least qualifies as feature of the week at the Muerto State Asylum .
367711	2707735	61850	2.0	" OK , see you day before yesterday . "	It's hard to believe that movies as bad as this were being made as late as 1967 . It's about as technologically advanced as any " B " grade film from the ' 40's , but done in color . However the garish orange of the lab setting and time capsule is so bright it will make you grab for a pair of sunglasses . So much for the high points . " Journey to the Center of Time " would be an embarrassment for a fledgling film student , that it was made at all with real money is to be questioned as much as the film's star Scott Brady questions his company's funding of research in the science of time travel . For two years , Doc Gordon ( Abraham Sofaer ) , Mark Manning ( Anthony Eisley ) and Karen White ( Gigi Perreau ) have only managed to navigate twenty four hours into the past . That's all about to change , as the trio , along with owner Stanton ( Brady ) kick start their time travel gizmo five thousand years into the future for a rendezvous with aspiring screen star Poupee Gamin , surely you recognize her name . One of her futuristic aides is Lyle Waggoner , who fortunately managed to survive this mess to earn a spot on the Carol Burnett Show and later , " Wonder Woman " . The time lab can best be compared to a time travel boomerang ; from the future the gang whips back to one million years B . C . to pick a nice round number , where the greedy Stanton grabs a jewel and takes off in the lab once again , stranding Manning and White in the past . In a series of frenetic flashbacks and flash forwards , the entire movie is relived for those of you who dozed off the first time . Getting beyond the embarrassment , you can have a fun time with this one as long as it's with a bunch of friends and the right mix of refreshments . The film can be enjoyed on many levels ; I know because it made as much sense played in reverse as it did played forward .
368070	2707735	200402	3.0	" It's only a building , lives are more important . "	The ninja kids in question are descendants of the Ming Dynasty who wear a talisman of their origin . The Ching want to kill them to remove all trace of their heritage . Just about the entire film is spent by the young martial artists in training with stone benches that will come in handy for the film's climax when they must do battle with the evil emperor in a giant spinning top . You couldn't make this up , so I'm wondering how they got that into the film . The movie mildly explores the relationship of an overbearing master who relentlessly trains his protégés , punishing them when they misbehave or don't perform to perfection . The scene when Wu Chan slaps the youngest boy changed the entire flavor of the story for me , especially since he didn't redeem himself in any way later on . The attempts at humor generally fall flat , like the pair of lanky warriors who might have been the two stooges of kung fu . There is one comedic scene done particularly well though . A few of the boys come upon a young female martial artist taking a bath in the river and one of the boys remarks - " Brother , why doesn't she have this ? " , while another checks his own anatomy for reassurance . I was perplexed by one scene near the end of the movie when the ninjas were working out in the cave . There on the floor in rather bold relief and colored in red was a large swastika . No mention of it was offered in the story , but it sure looked strange . Not being a big fan of the genre , I was intrigued enough to pick up this DVD when I saw the title in a bargain bin at a local store , especially since it was paired with another flick called " Little Mad Guy " . It only cost a buck , and to be honest , it was worth every penny , which is to say , about fifty cents worth .
368042	2707735	41783	3.0	" Anything you might say or do here carries about as much weight as the howl of a hound dog . "	As a collector of old time Western movie posters , I'm compelled to get my hands on a copy of the film corresponding to the titles I've gotten . My Monte Hale poster comes from " Ranger of Cherokee Strip " , so therein lies my motivation to see this film . Believe me when I tell you , the poster is better than the movie . Hale portrays ranger Steve Howard , on the trail of Joe Bearclaws ( Douglas Kennedy ) , recently escaped from the Kansas Penitentiary and heading for Oklahoma's Cherokee Indian Territory . Bearclaws maintains his innocence , and is intent on reaching Chief Hunter ( Monte Blue ) , before the chief agrees to sign a lease agreement giving local cattlemen the right to cross Indian territory with their herds . Bearclaws is aided along the way by friend and sheriff Jugs Mason ( Paul Hurst ) , who believes in his innocence . The writers of the story obviously took great liberty in overlooking basic human emotion in their development of the characters . For example , when ranger Howard first catches up with Bearclaws , they duke it out in wild fashion . Feigning a knockout , Bearclaws lies motionless on the ground , and as Howard checks his condition , the Indian knocks him out with a good sized rock . The fact that he didn't crack the ranger's skull open is one thing , but in their very next scene together , Howard more or less just brushes it off . He arrests the Indian again , but doesn't restrict him in any way , or even take away his gun ! After riding a sufficient distance , Bearclaws and the sheriff simply turn the tables on Howard once again . This kind of nonsense goes back and forth for most of the film . When it comes to Bearclaws ' meeting with Chief Hunter , Howard okays a delay in the Chief's signing extradition papers for Joe , and actually lets him leave to meet with his fiancée Mary Bluebird ( Alice Tilton ) at the Eagle Junction Cherokee school . While he's gone , the local heavies under the direction of main bad guy McKinnon ( Frank Fenton ) frame Joe for the murder of Chief Hunter . This time though , ranger Howard along with Sheriff Jugs hatch a plan to exonerate him and bring the villains to justice . Don't get me wrong now , I'm a major fan of the " B " Western genre , but this movie is pretty much a mess and seriously defies credibility . There isn't much believable here , not the least of which is an Irishman portraying an Indian - major casting faux pas ! I recommend the poster .
368270	2707735	54285	3.0	" This is the only hope you have , keep that in mind always . "	" Atom Age Vampire " makes use of a lot of pseudo scientific jargon to make the most of " restoring normal growth of abnormal cells " and " spontaneous reproduction of living cells " . Professor Alberto Levin ( Alberto Lupo ) isn't sure of his Derma 28 invention , but able assistant Monique ( Franca Parisi ) convinces him to use the serum on the facially disfigured Jeanette Moreneau , a jilted lover whose out of control car dives over a cliff with the obligatory burst into flames aftermath . Roberto Bertea portrays the loyal lab assistant Sacha , whose presence doesn't do much to add or subtract from the film's proceedings . What's not explained very well is Levin's own mutation back and forth into a hideously disfigured wolfman with a complexion problem . The film's English title holds out possibilities , but it's more in the realm of suggestion than delivery ; not a vampire in the lot either , pseudo or otherwise . You can do worse than " Atom Age Vampire " , but then you'd be in " Beast of Yucca Flats " territory , hardly a worthwhile way to spend an hour . Unless you're like me and just have to sample every imaginable movie with a cool sounding title , you can let this one pass into modern age oblivion .
368208	2707735	28582	3.0	" Tex , you're just one of those guys that don't know when he's well off . "	" Arizona Days " opens with a snappy song on horseback by cowboy star Tex Ritter , but truthfully , that's about as entertaining as this film gets in it's fifty seven minute run . However the DVD print I viewed had a rather disjointed cut following a scene where Tex offers to help a minstrel show owner by paying off a thirty one dollar debt in exchange for a singing gig in the show . It quickly jumps to a ten pace gunfight between Tex and villain Harry Price ( Forrest Taylor ) . Another review of the film states that Price was behind the burning of the minstrel show wagons , so with this scene missing , the movie's continuity suffers in the print I saw . Syd Saylor is Tex's sidekick , and provides a bit of comic relief with a running gag where he attempts to play a trombone to poor effect . Saylor's film history includes an astounding 360 movies in which he appeared , though uncredited in many of them . My first intro to Saylor's work was as John Wayne's sidekick Dink Hooley in " Born to the West " , also known as " Helltown " , where he gets a few laughs trying to sell lightning rods to unsuspecting victims . When you come right down to it , there's not much of a story here , as Tex manages to get the drop on Price's gang in an attempt to secure back taxes that they owe . Tex won the right to collect when he beat bad guy Price to the draw in the aforementioned gunfight . Poor production values and a consistently dark picture often interfered with this viewer's enjoyment of the film . On the plus side were three tunes by Ritter , including " High , Wide and Handsome " , " Arizona Days " , and opening and closing renditions of " Tombstone , Arizona " . Pretty Eleanor Stewart winds up as Ritter's new bride in the closing scene , even though there was no romance to speak of during the movie , but the image you'll remember is Syd Saylor's character " Grass " Hopper wearing a " Just Married " sign around his neck as he rides the back of the buckboard heading out of town .
368379	2707735	74157	3.0	" Fascinating rock structure David ! "	This is just about one of the dumbest things I've ever seen . Maybe not a worst movie ever contender , but if you haven't seen that many bad ones , this could easily make your Top Ten Worst List . When you consider what was achieved in 1933 with the original " King Kong " , you've got to ask yourself why anyone would stoop so low as to produce this debacle . Then , taking it one step further and realizing that the quantum leap to " Star Wars " the following year achieved a new level in sci-fi entertainment , this offering will make you laugh and cry at the same time . Now let me ask you , what would possess the Professor ( Peter Cushing ) to bring along an umbrella as a prime piece of subterranean research equipment for the ride to the earth's core ? OK , so it was useful in fending off the parrot / tyrannosaur ( parrotosaurus ? ) in the early going , but come on . Somehow I don't think this is what Edgar Rice Burrough's had in mind when he wrote his tales of Pellucidar . He probably didn't have Caroline Munro in mind either as Princess Dia , probably the only redeeming factor to this whole escapade . At least there was one bit of pseudo-scientific explanation that I got a kick out of ; I'm always looking for one in films like this . That would have to be how the sky at the earth's core was really the underside of the earth's crust , explaining that ethereal pinkish glow . But try as it might , the story just couldn't hook me in a way to find anything at all interesting about Hoojah the Sly One or Jubal the Ugly One , much less those goofy half man , half pterodactyl creatures . To paraphrase the good professor - " You cannot mesmerize me , I'm paying attention ! "
368384	2707735	28074	3.0	" Hey , I can fix that right up . I've got the grandest headache medicine in the world . "	It's true what they say - I started with " Reefer Madness " and " The Marijuana Menace " , and gradually worked up to the really hard stuff - " The Cocaine Fiends " . But I have to tell you , if you watch this film under the influence , it will make just about as much sense . I was generally able to follow what was going on in the story , but there were so many dropped frames and jump cuts I wasn't sure if anything significant might have been left out . The real head scratcher comes near the end of the picture when Dorothy Farley's father is revealed as the top kingpin in the drug rackets at the same time that he's trying to keep his daughter ' sweet and clean ' . The scene exemplifies how poorly the film was in terms of building upon earlier events to tell a coherent story . Of course that probably was not the intent ; this was one of those ' educational ' films that tried to get it's anti-drug scourge message across during a much less sophisticated era . After seeing a handful of these flicks recently , it's safe to say that on that level , they probably had no impact at all . For all it's evil connotation , the actual use of the word cocaine only occurs a few times in the story . Instead , the drug is routinely referred to as ' headache powders ' by the malevolent dope dealer as a way to hook potential victims . By the time one becomes a ' hophead ' , he's ready and willing to sell his soul for just one more shot . The film does a good job at least of showing how drug victims go downhill quickly , usurping all motivation except for getting that high just one more time . But for all that , the picture never does show anyone actually snorting the stuff , it's all done by insinuation and after the fact . Kind of ironic if the mission was to show how unglamorous taking drugs is . The hardest thing for me about the movie is trying to wrap my brain around the fact that it's OVER 70 YEARS OLD ! ! ! That , along with the perspective that's offered relative to what value things had back in the Thirties . Imagine a six dollar cover charge for the privilege of sharing two gin fizzes ( $1 . 50 ) and two highballs ( $2 . 00 ) ; with tax , a total of $9 . 79 . On Eddie's ( Dean Benton ) twenty five dollar pay week , it was unnerving to see him squirm at the prospect of forking over almost half his paycheck for a few minutes of fun at the Dead Rat Cafe . Geez , who would name their place the Dead Rat ? !
368299	2707735	42855	3.0	" What type of women are these ruling wonders who attack men and live in trees ? "	While watching , my mind constantly came back to the question of what would possess someone to make a film like this . Sure , the story's opening hints of romance when the world was young , but then can't decide if it was ten or a hundred thousand years ago . Only one thing is certain with a film like this , with all the scantily clad women center stage , it's only a matter of time before the obligatory cat fight . That takes place about midway through , but you'll have to endure endless plodding narration at both ends before calling it a day . There are some interesting historical breakthroughs on display though . The male hero Engor ( Allan Nixon ) discovers fire , while his buddy Kama invents the barbecue , even if by accident . As goofy as it all looks , if you think about it , that very first piece of cooked meat had to get a start somewhere , so this is just as good a rationalization as any . Come to think of it , if the male tribe had a streak of cannibalism , old Guadi might have been on the menu when he became a crispy critter - yikes ! I'd be curious to find out how close this movie was to being the first done in color . Quite a few scenes look natural enough , but you'll have to muddle through a murky opening suggesting a soft porn ritual dance by the man-less women tribe . Then there are scenes that actually look like they're in black and white . For fans of family trees , the Smith and Jones equivalent of the dinosaur era must have been Engor . That was also the name of the main male tribesman in the 1958 flick , " Wild Women of Wongo " . That film also followed the exploits of love starved prehistoric women who set out to enslave male captives for the purpose of , well you know . Watching that film might also lead you to the same query as posited earlier , but at least WWoW had a campy flavor and didn't take itself as seriously as this one . Here however , the women used bolos and clubs to beat on the cave boys , so score one for Tigri and the girls . Nice outfits too !
368185	2707735	28174	4.0	" You have the secret of the zombies , let me have it . "	Though the title includes the word " zombies " , this film is not what you'd expect from a movie made today , though for 1936 the concept is played out about as well as would probably be expected . Dean Jagger portrays Armand Louque , an officer in the French Army of World War I , who has stumbled upon an ancient tale of soldiers turned into automatons , or " zombies " , who are impervious in battle and may hold the key to victory in the war , though on whose side is not certain . At first he has trouble convincing his superiors of this phenomenon , but eventually French General Duval ( George Cleveland ) orders a non military expedition into the ancient Cambodian city of Angkor to find the secret of the zombies and destroy it . The story is played out against the backdrop of a love triangle involving Louque , Duval's daughter Claire ( Dorothy Stone ) , and Clifford Grayson ( Robert Noland ) , all a part of the expedition . When Louque laments over his lack of forcefulness and resolve , Grayson offers him advice to go after what he wants in life with all his power . That advice begins to transform Louque , particularly after he's successful in obtaining a stone tablet resembling a photo from the ancient city . Having followed a temple priest into a swamp , Louque now appears to hold the secret he had been seeking , though it's not made clear how he has instantaneously been able to command the power of " zombiefication " . All it takes is placing his right fist to the forehead simulating a third eye , and casting his thoughts out to those he wishes to control . This comes in handy for winning back his girl , and taking Grayson's early advice as he comments to his servant , " Buna , we're learning to be ruthless " . Fans of early " B " horror flicks will recognize the use of Bela Lugosi's signature eye stare , plucked from the 1932 film " White Zombie " , also from director Victor Halperin . Of the two movies , " White Zombie " is preferably superior , both in story content and in it's depiction of the undead , where the zombies have a more sinister appearance and are more threatening . In " Revolt " , the zombies are enemy soldiers with a glazed over look that merely react to their mentor's commands . In fact , the actual revolt of the title occurs only when Louque releases the soldiers from his mental command in deference to his love for Claire ; they overrun his compound and kill him in the process . Not to be too harsh on the film , it plays out decently within the parameters of it's story outline , but if you're thinking " zombies ! ! ! " within the traditional context , you'll probably be disappointed . If you want to sample an early treatment of the subject , the aforementioned " White Zombie " with Bela Lugosi is the way to go .
368462	2707735	69933	4.0	" Just make sure that stake is good and sharp or we're all dead . "	With a title like " Crypt Of The Living Dead " I guess I was expecting a little more in the way of zombie spectacle . Not that I'm particularly a fan of that type of genre , but you have certain expectations . What the picture lacks in horror and gore is suitably replaced by creepy atmosphere , which is probably the highlight of the film . In my case , the print I viewed was quite poor in sound quality ; it was part of a twenty film DVD pack from Mill Creek Entertainment , and as one other viewer mentioned , the black and white format was certainly preferred for the subject matter . I actually learned more about the story from some of the other reviewers on this board than from watching the flick , but then again , I was able to pick up all the information I needed from a handful of scenes that moved the story along . OK , so Hannah ( Teresa Gimpera ) , 1269 is a vampire looking none the worse for wear and fresh as a daisy from a seven hundred year long dirt nap . A little weak in the knees , her transformation into a werewolf is designed to buy time by feasting on other animals while gaining strength to do in some eventual humans . Not a bad concept , and actually quite sensible when you get right down to it . What really distracted me from the story was every single appearance of Andrew Prine on screen as Chris Bolton investigating his father's death . He looked like he could be the spitting image of a guy I knew about twenty years ago who's since passed away . That just added a certain intangible creepiness to the whole story for me . Anyway , you won't miss a whole lot if you pass on this one , but at the same time it's not the worst flick to while away a quick seventy five minutes . I'm still puzzled by the idea of a guy in a caveman get-up , but there's not enough there to get hung up about .
368038	2707735	65596	4.0	" I figure I'll meet the Apache sooner or later , guess I'd rather it be later . "	I've been intrigued by the title of this 1970 Western for some time , so when I had a chance to pick it up new for just a buck , I thought I'd give it a try . I believe I'm due some change . The film offers a quartet of villainous desperadoes on the hunt for gold , who brutalize an Indian family and expect the lone surviving squaw to deliver them to the goods . It's never made clear why a fifth member of the group , portrayed by Jody McCrae , is along for the ride . He's the only one who appears to have had a bath recently , and comports himself reasonably well , though he does little to mitigate the nasty behavior of his compadres . On the flip side , as he gets cozy with Apache squaw Jemme , ( Marie Gahva ) , the boys generally give it no mind , like he wouldn't even think of double crossing them . The first half of the film plods along rather slowly ; the action what there is comes in the second half as an Apache brave picks up the trail of the evil-doers and prepares to exact revenge . His first victim gets the standard arrow in the back treatment , but then the Indian's inventiveness gets you to sit up and take notice . Benji ( Don Henley ) finds himself the subject of an upside down gravity drowning , screaming for his dying brother and his mama to help . Later , using the old snake in the bag over the head trick , another gang member meets his end . It seems to me though that " Two Card " Charlie must have died of fright ; a close up of the snake shows it to be too narrow and without the markings of a rattler . The fate of Bible quoting Deacon ( Jack Starrett ) is not dealt with on screen , but his skeleton makes a cameo at the end of the movie . One thing about the avenging Apache is intriguing ; he's usually shown tracking the gang on entirely different terrain than the bad guys are using . For the most part , it appears that a desert setting prevails , but the Indian finds himself careening down rough river rapids , and winding through rocky mountain paths . The bad guys never encountered those obstacles . You'll find veteran actor Joel McCrea's name top billed as a selling point for " Cry Blood , Apache " , but don't be fooled . He's shown at the beginning and end of the film as an older and wiser version of the " good " bad guy Pitcallin , contemplating sardonically on the events of his past life as shown in the movie . Somehow , his final wistful look seems to be saying he's glad it's over , the movie that is .
368129	2707735	87479	4.0	" Did you catch your maniac yet ? "	Ten years after ' Star Trek ' and this film features an escaped convict using the ' beam me up Scotty ' routine without a teleporter device . Roger Sands ( Frank Ashmore ) is on the hunt for celebrity starlets who remind him of his mom so that he can practice his strangle holds on them . Roger was kept in isolation by his mother growing up and never got a chance to play nice . On the hunt for the invisible killer is perennial TV movie actor Robert Foxworth , a police lieutenant teamed up with a pen clicking detective ( Mark Slade ) and a wife who only dresses her upper body ( Stefanie Powers ) . Her standard line when hubby Chuck goes off to do his police work is " Have a nice time " . In early scenes when Sands becomes invisible , he does so clothes and all . That's why it's a bit curious during a beach scene when the lieutenant finds Sands ' scuba suit discarded following an escape using his powers , an interesting lapse of continuity . The film's original release title is probably a better fit for the story than the one I saw it under - " The Astral Factor " . About midway through I began to feel just like Roger Sands commenting to his mother in a flashback scene ' " . . . I just can't do it any more " . If anyone recommends getting together to watch this flick , consider making yourself invisible .
368328	2707735	29989	4.0	" Child marriage must go ! "	This just might be the creepiest movie I've seen to date , and not even for reasons posted in some of the other viewer comments on this board . The scene that got to me was the wedding ceremony near the end of the story with old Jake Bolby ( Warner Richmond ) all but licking his chops to get little Jennie Colton ( Shirley Mills ) home for consummation of the marriage . I don't doubt that stuff like this went on during the era represented , or that it might even be happening today under cover of darkest secrecy , but seeing it on display in this ' educational ' format was downright horrific . As with the exploitation drug films of the 1930's , the film makers were attempting to hit the lowest common denominator on the prurient interest scale to make a quick buck and move on to the next subject . It seemed to be a prerequisite with the anti-drug films to include a dead body in the story for graphic punctuation , and so it was here too ; impending child bride weddings cause suffering , pain , and even death . Now on the other hand , I didn't seem to have as much a problem with Jenny's nude swim scene that most other reviewers had . Within the context of the story , it seemed like a natural thing to do at the time , probably the only way these mountain people ever got to take a bath . There was really nothing ' to see ' in the version I watched , though I understand the Mill Creek DVD presentation is somewhat less graphic with a couple of missing minutes of footage . I'm almost tempted to go back to see if there was something I missed , but then I'd be part of that low end prurient interest faction , so I think I'll pass . You know what else was pretty nasty ? How about those pigeons dumping on the schoolbooks in the Thunderhead Mountain School classroom ? I wonder if there was an exploitation film about the dangers of bird doo ?
368354	2707735	25699	4.0	" My orders were to work alone . "	Randy Bowers ( John Wayne ) comes upon the Half Way House at just the right time to take a break from the trail , and discovers a slew of dead bodies inside , among them a man he was supposed to deliver a message to - Ed Rogers , proprietor of the establishment . He's observed by the dead man's niece Sally ( Alberta Vaughn ) , from behind a hidden room , where she remained unobserved during the carnage . " Randy Rides Alone " was directed by Harry Fraser . He uses a filming technique here as in other of his films , where he fast forwards the action from one location to another , usually involving a rider on a horse . It's pretty well done and appears quite innovative in these 1930's era Lone Star Westerns . Pre-Gabby George Hayes is on hand , sans whiskers , and this is the first time I've seen him as a villain . In fact it took a few scenes to realize it was him in a dual role , first as hunchbacked businessman " Matt the Mute " , communicating via pencil and paper , only to turn into Marvin Black , leader of a gang of outlaws . Black's gang was responsible for the murders at Half Way House , in an attempt to coerce Sally into selling out to Matt / Marvin . Another staple player is here as well , Yakima Canutt as a Black henchman named Spike . Interestingly , Yakima portrayed a villain named Sam Black in another Fraser / Wayne oater , " Neath the Arizona Skies " . There's a fair amount of time-killing horseback riding back and forth between Black's Gang and the Sheriff's posse , as John Wayne's character maneuvers to expose the bad guys . In the end , he saves the day by securing Sally Rogers ' thirty thousand dollars , at the expense of destroying the Half Way House , where he exchanges some sticks of dynamite for the loot in a safe . Greedy Marvin Black attempts to open it with his six-shooter , and the explosion is a fitting end for the villain . In his best " Aw shucks " attitude , John Wayne falls under the spell of the pretty Sally Rogers , and alas , Randy rides alone no more !
367774	2707735	52929	4.0	" I want to believe that I'm out of my mind John , but I can't . "	Oh boy ! , this is one of the best bad movies you'll ever see , with elements of horror and sci-fi blending together to produce a cult classic . It's got one of those ' warning from outer space ' themes , complete with invisible aliens who make their point with Earthlings by taking over dead bodies and wreaking havoc and destruction all over the world . The influence on 1968's " Night of the Living Dead " is unmistakable , but made comical by what looks like an army of zombies fresh from a Raymond Burr look alike contest . I got a kick out of the aliens ' first warning - one of the invisible invaders takes over the corpse of a pilot that crashed into the side of a mountain ; there was a huge ' + ' target on the side of the mountain when it hit ! Apparently , the aliens had a penchant for American sporting events , as they interrupt a hockey match and an event at a large stadium to make their televised threats to mankind . Say , do you think their space ships could really have been made out of crumpled aluminum foil ? The goofy story line is remarkably enhanced by some of the best lines in a sci-fi flick ever . The one in my subject line is a favorite , and how about when Phyllis Penner ( Jean Byron ) warns Major Jay ( John Agar ) about leaving the bunker to trap an alien - " There's enough radiation out there to kill you , please be careful " . Armed with a contamination suit , a shovel and a rope , Major Jay traps an alien by luring one of those walking corpses into an acrylic pit - " Looks like we caught ourselves an invader " . ( I just write ' em , I don't explain ' em , you'll just have to see it ) . Ultimately , the ' vast scientific knowledge ' of Professors Penner ( Philip Tonge ) and Lamont ( Robert Hutton ) lead to the alien defeat , but not before their military bunker that can withstand a direct A-bomb blast is incapacitated by a smashed beaker of chemicals . This is one flick you'll be sorry to see end , believe me . The most clever bit - a newspaper front page with the caption - ' First Photo of an Invisible Invader ' - it was blank . Beautiful ! ! !
368168	2707735	29578	4.0	" From now on , our policy is to crusade against vice ! "	Well the title is a lot more suggestive than the story ever gets to be . The most exploitative this flick ever gets is showing a half dozen or so young girls in their undies , and they didn't seem to mind all that much . The trigger for the plot occurs right at the outset with a botched kidnap attempt ( the girl was walking home from church ! ! ! ! ) , and from then on it's about getting the goods on a traveling prostitution ring . Darn if my timing isn't just SO coincidental with the Eliot Spitzer mess , but no one here looked anything like ' Kristen ' , Ashley Alexandra Dupre , or whatever name she might be using right now . But it was made seventy years ago , so I guess we can cut it some slack . You know , I couldn't figure out why Good Looking Freddie was such a klutz - didn't he ever read the newspapers ? He would have known he was a hot commodity before Big Jim Murray ( Wheeler Oakman ) and Belle Harris ( Florence Dudley ) ever put the finger on him . And holy cow ! - what was with those two boarding house guys with the goofy acrobatics ? You would think that for an exploitation film , the principals involved could have made use of more stimulating filler related to the topic . Like a few more shots of the hookers in their underwear . It's all a stretch , I know , but there are so many good grief moments in the picture that it strains credibility on so many levels . I doubt you'll catch this one on any of your favorite cable channels , but stay alert and it will pop up as part of a four disc , twenty film DVD set from Mill Creek Entertainment , that's to be commended for putting out tons of old material like this under various headings . This set goes by the way of ' Cult Classics ' , and it's a hoot to catch a whole barrel full of 1930's era ' educational ' films related to the evils of the day , which quite coincidentally managed to make it to the present time . I guess we haven't really learned that much since , have we ?
368039	2707735	25452	4.0	" You have beaten my wife and she's gone off with another man ; you are a dirty dog . "	I'll have to admit that I'm at a disadvantage here ; when I learn more about a film from other reviewers than from watching it myself , then that's a problem . Although the plot of " The Man Who Knew Too Much " seems generally straightforward , the movie allows too many cryptic elements to get in the way of what could have been a satisfying mystery . By the time we get to the scene where a witchy looking woman establishes the secrecy of " the first degree of the seven fold ray " , I didn't know whether to laugh or rewind to see if I missed something . In retrospect , the cryptic note retrieved by Mr . Lawrence ( Leslie Banks ) from the handle of a shaving brush was a craftily written message , leading to a dentist named Barbor , and eventually to the Albert Hall , a place , not a person as indicated by " A . Hall " . But for all the intrigue , it's never made clear why the assassination target was being eliminated . Okay , so Louis Bernard was killed because he knew of a plot to assassinate a diplomat named Ropa , but why was Ropa a target ? Come to think of it , why was the note even written and secured in the shaving brush ? Did Bernard have to refer to it every now and then to remind himself what was going to happen ? With it's disjointed scenes , " The Man Who Knew Too Much " is hard to follow and a bit disorienting , however I'll give Alfred Hitchcock credit for this early effort . For perspective , I'll have to watch some of his other work of the same era , though this movie certainly can't hold a candle to his later works like " Psycho " or " North by Northwest " .
368161	2707735	38409	4.0	" I'd say she was contemplating a voyage . "	I strongly disapprove of a film where I have to rewind to understand what's going on , especially if the person I've just seen murdered shows up again in her bedroom writing in her diary . It's all part of a pill addled nightmare sequence experienced by Chuck Scott ( Robert Cummings ) , newly hired chauffeur to gangster Eddie Roman ( Steve Cochran ) . The basic plot has Roman's unhappy wife Lorna ( Michele Morgan ) convincing Scott to hustle her off to Cuba from Miami to escape an abusive marriage . This might have all worked out pretty well if the stuff that didn't happen actually happened , but instead , the stuff that really happens isn't nearly as interesting , making the stuff that's about to happen inconsequential . It's too bad too , because I was really getting into the characterizations of Cochran , Cummings , Morgan and Roman's henchman Gino , Peter Lorre in a menacing tease of a role that could have really scared up the heebie-jeebies . I especially enjoyed the conversation they shared regarding their occupation of choice being the amusement business , in it strictly for laughs . Too bad about the Napoleon brandy . Some of the more frustrated reviewers on this board complain about how confusing the story is , but if you follow it logically , it's not really . The point at which Chuck Scott realizes he's had a nightmare is clearly revealed , followed chronologically by events that lead to the finale . I guess the plus side of the movie allows for the ' Dallas ' style ending to play out right in the middle , but wasn't it just too convenient how Scott gets the girl ? Just how ' Love That Bob " might have done it .
368457	2707735	183884	4.0	" You can never tell what you're gonna run into at four o'clock in the morning . "	Someone , somewhere , at some time must have thought this was a pretty good idea for a picture . But come on , even with the back drop of Cold War hysteria and all those ' duck and cover ' air raid drills back in grammar school , this is one sorry effort . I keep thinking about the character of Deputy Dan Colter ( Seamon Glass ) and I just have to shake my head . What a pain in the butt . Did it really make that much of a difference where everyone parked their cars ? And what was the big deal about getting everyone's name - he never referred to anyone by name afterwards anyway . Then he really earned the creep of the year award by choking out the little puppy dog . You would think by that time every able bodied guy and gal on board would just rush the lunatic and throw him over to go their own way . The inclusion of the hitchhiker killer was an interesting touch though . Remember when granddaughter Juney ( Aubrey Martin ) stated to him that they were all going to die ? Clint ( Ron Starr ) responded by saying that she wouldn't because she was nice . Sounded to me like he might have had a plan , but they all went out the window when he tried making a tossed chicken salad while all the birds were still alive . Curiously , most of the other reviews of the flick on this board seem fairly supportive , making me wonder whether I watched the same story . I don't know , I put myself in the place of any one of the poor roadside hostages and I think I'd be of a mind to take out old Deputy Colter and make a feeble run for it , foolish as that might have been . After all , it wasn't a test , so why bother following rules ?
368460	2707735	30972	4.0	" I never seen him before , but he can sure sling lead ! "	By the time " Whirlwind Horseman " came out , Ken Maynard was well past his prime as a major cowboy star , winding down his career with movies for Grand National and Colony Pictures . Here , Maynard wears one of the biggest good guy white hats going , as he tries to get to the bottom of a ' sudden burst of lawlessness ' with sidekick Happy ( Bill Griffith ) . Together they're also trying to locate a missing friend and old timer named Cherokee Jake ( Bud Buster ) , who's being kept hostage by the bad guys for the location of an oil discovery . The villains are terrorizing all the local ranchers until they can determine where the actual oil well is so they can turn in their own claim on it . The set up for this one is about as standard as they come and the effort is fairly unremarkable . The print I viewed was hampered by some of the darkened day time sequences that plague other Westerns of the era that are somewhat annoying if you haven't seen it before and gotten accustomed to it . There's also the frequent pauses in dialog between characters as if waiting for a cue or for something significant to happen . Maynard himself is involved in his share of those and you find yourself wondering what everyone is waiting around for . There's one bit of action that stands out , and that's when Sheriff Ken Morton ( Maynard ) runs a rope across the trail and trips up four horses and riders from the bad guy posse . If you stop to think about it though , there's no way you can believe that one guy can trip up four charging horses with his bare hands ( even with gloves on ) like that . It's another example of trip wires in use before the PETA folks got involved against cruelty to animals . All the horse got up from this one , but it couldn't have been fun . The most recognizable baddie in the flick is perennial ' B ' oater stand-by , Glenn Strange . I like to think that between him and Stanley Andrews , they appeared in just about every Western ever made in the early days . You watch any classic TV or movie Western prior to the mid 1960's and you'll probably see one or the other , and that's a good thing . You know , the ' Whirlwind Horseman ' wouldn't have been as much without a whirlwind horse . Maynard's light colored palomino was named Tarzan , and watching them gallop across the screen together was one of the thrills of their pictures . Tarzan has some good presence in this flick , even if you never hear his name mentioned .
368563	2707735	28163	5.0	" I'm beginning to smell a rat ! "	The Red River Land and Irrigation Company is experiencing sabotage at a number of their project dams , so Gene Autry hires on to investigate the trouble . Smiley Burnette's on hand as Gene's sidekick Frog Millhouse , but this isn't one of his pictures where you get to hear that distinctive frog voice . That's OK , as Gene and Frog foil a nefarious group attempting to undermine the local ranchers by disrupting the dam operation , but it's never really made clear what the scheme is all about . You kind of have to figure out on your own that if the local ranchers fail , the mortgages on their properties would be ripe for picking by the local hoods . There's a term introduced in the story that I've never heard before in an early Western , or any Western for that matter . Once Gene hires on with the locals , he's referred to as a ' ditch rider ' , presumably for patrolling the local dam sites to prevent their destruction . The term didn't seem to be particularly appropriate , but it sounded kind of cool , so I guess I can let it pass . I had to do a double take when I watched that scene of Gene going over the cliff on his horse Champion to escape the bad guy posse . I would swear I'd seen the exact same scene before in a movie , and since the era is the mid 1930's , I would suspect it's from one of John Wayne's early Lone Star Westerns . It will probably take me some time to research the exact picture , but I'll get around to it some day . As for Smiley following Gene into the drink , that's a different story . I like to think of events like that as a warm up for that great scene where Butch and Sundance escape Lord Baltimore's posse by jumping into the river at the bottom of a canyon . Unique for an Autry Western , I thought the inclusion of the black character Iodine ( Eugene Jackson ) to be pretty entertaining . I don't think I've seen him before in a picture , but I'll be more attentive now . He actually got to do a little more than just a bit part with that dance routine at the saloon , nicely done . As for Gene's nominal love interest in the story , it blew by pretty quickly . Frances Grant portrayed the daughter of one of the local ranchers , and she almost got as far as holding hands with Gene . Not too shabby , but the one thing that really caught me by surprise in the picture had to do with Gene and Smiley closing in on the bad guys . I never saw it before in at least a couple dozen of Autry's flicks , but Smiley actually takes a bullet in the shoulder !
368015	2707735	28231	5.0	" Somehow I don't like murders at close quarters as much as I expected . . . "	First off , I'll state that I enjoyed " Secret Agent " , however on reflection , the story doesn't hold up realistically as the espionage drama it sets out to be . Not that it couldn't have been , it's just that the story development overlooked some important considerations . The main one is the integrity of Madeleine Carroll's character , Elsa Carrington . Presumably , Elsa is an agent assigned to assist novelist / aviator Edgar Brodie ( John Gielgud ) in his new identity , that of Richard Ashenden . When the going gets tough after she gets romantically involved with Ashenden , she's ready to ditch him and seek escape in the company of their known target , a German courier named Robert Marvin ( Robert Young ) . Had the British government known how wishy washy she was , would she have ever been given such an important mission ? Come to think of it , how did she even become a spy ? And how does Ashenden decide he's simply going to quit the mission after the wrong man is killed ? Fortunately that didn't have to be answered , because he was back on the case quicker than a commercial break . There are some other elements that stretch credibility also . While I can accept an intangible connection between a man and his pet , I found Caypor's dachshund to be absolutely psychic , so tuned in was he to his master's unfortunate death . On balance though , the film is somewhat redeemed by an amazingly adept performance by Young's character as he attempts to woo Elsa , even though her cover was as wife of Ashenden . Director Hitchcock's reliance on humor was served well by their steady comedic banter which had a genuine naturalness to it . I won't get into Peter Lorre's characterization as the hairless Mexican , as even the film admits coming up short on that one . Lorre is gleefully crazed as he pounds walls with his fist and attacks a roll of toilet paper , which by the way , wasn't exactly in a bathroom , was it ? I don't quite know what to make of the climactic closing sequence . With Elsa once again changing stride in midstream , the British agents confront their quarry in a confined railroad car , the rest of the train brimming with German military . As English planes commence a bombing run and destroy the tracks , the train collides in a heap , leaving the four principals dazed in their compartment . As they all slowly come to , The General ( Lorre ) sets his handgun in front of the German agent , presumably to elicit his own suicide in a hopeless situation . Bad move , he uses it on The General . It reminded me of an earlier quote uttered by both Ashenden and The General in unison - " He hasn't got a copy of the rules " .
368091	2707735	68539	5.0	" Oh that's lousy coffee , an ' you're a lyin ' skunk " .	Prior reviewers in this forum have been a bit more generous than I'm prepared to be . This was my first Bud Spencer film , and I found it to be adequate at best . If not for the sneering presence of Jack Palance there might not have been enough to hold my interest . Spencer's character is Hiram Coburn , who's gimmick with the eyeglasses portends someone about to get hurt , though that convention falls away by the end of the story . He's a slow to get riled caretaker for a young Chip Anderson ( Renato Cestie ) who has to slug his way through a slew of bad hombres until the payoff . The orphan boy is the sole owner of ' Welldigger's Roost ' , a ramshackle cabin in the ramshackle town of Westland , but the object of much interest by the town's all around judge / preacher / sheriff Franciscus ( Francisco Rabal ) , and a curious dirt eating prospector . The old coot has a taste for gold , but it's an oil gusher that eventually proves out on the ' Roost ' . Until that point , Coburn stays busy dodging Sonny Bronston ( Palance ) and his sister Mary ( Dany Saval ) . Sonny wants to make an honest woman of his sister , apparently after a fling with Coburn , although if you follow the film closely , that's not really ever made clear . Mary pretends to be pregnant , which puts her brother's plans for killing Coburn on hold , but Coburn himself never really fesses up to the deed . The best line of the film is his during the wedding ceremony which he attends hogtied - Mary - " But why have they got you tied up ? " Coburn - " To restrain my enthusiasm . " Though filmed in color , there are a fair amount of drab sequences that look virtually black and white . The print I viewed also seemed to be badly edited , subject to jump cuts that change the direction of the story on a dime ; it occurred enough times to be annoying . I liked Palance in the flick , almost a two decade preview of his character ( s ) in the " City Slickers " franchise . Whether on purpose or not , he changes accents frequently in the picture , with his Mexican take the best . It's a hoot to see his ' girls ' fawning all over him ; one gets the impression they might have been part of a traveling whorehouse , but they never did more than kick up their heels at the Westland saloon . Except for Mary , they could have all gotten a bit more screen time , amigo .
367762	2707735	32818	5.0	" Who shall defile the temples of the ancient gods , a cruel and violent death shall be his fate . "	" The Mummy's Hand " opens with scenes lifted from the 1932 Universal film " The Mummy " , and that remains about the only connection to the original . George Zucco as Professor Andoheb is entrusted with the secret formula that will bring the dead back to life , but it must be strictly followed , or the result will be uncontrollable power in the Mummy so revived . Not one , but two veteran B Western stars are brought aboard for this erzats followup to " The Mummy " - Tom Tyler as the bandaged one , and Dick Foran as the central hero Steve Banning , leading an expedition into the Egyptian desert to locate the lost tomb of Princess Ananka . He is assisted by comic sidekick Babe Jenson ( Wallace Ford ) , magician Solvani the Great ( Cecil Kelloway ) who finances the expedition , and Solvani's daughter Marta ( Peggy Moran ) , at first skeptical but then a more than willing love interest for Foran's character . But the best performance of the lot goes to George Zucco as Andoheb , who takes control of The Mummy , sending him on a mission to maintain his revival by locating the fluid extracted from tana leaves which accompanied his burial . In addition , Andoheb plans to make himself and Marta immortal as his own personal high priestess - what a guy ! When the tomb of Ananka is eventually discovered , it brought me a chuckle . It's HUGE and an elaborately done set , but Banning and his team are constantly frustrated by their inability to find it ! Pay attention during a conversation following the discovery of the Mummy's second victim Ali , the foreman of Banning's digging crew . The name Ali must have been on Dick Foran's mind , because he calls Marta " Molly " . Have fun with " The Mummy's Hand " , along with the other Universal " sequels " , but don't expect any to come close to the mood , atmosphere , or conviction of the original . Even Lon Chaney couldn't work that magic in " The Mummy's Tomb " , " The Mummy's Curse " , and " The Mummy's Ghost " .
368288	2707735	35009	5.0	" I don't know what's come over me , I must have a touch of swamp fever . "	It seems to me that you'll either love or hate this offering , judging by the comments of other reviewers for the film . As a fan of the genre , I'll always give the benefit of the doubt to the plus side , I rather got a kick out of " The Mad Monster " , with George Zucco as a deranged scientist , given to phantom meetings with his former colleagues who drummed him out of academia for his outlandish experiments and theories . After all , if you're looking to ingratiate yourself with the War Department , you might want to check the dictionary for a suitable replacement for an " army of wolf men " . But it's exactly this kind of weirdness that makes the film fun , especially when Dr . Lorenzo Cameron ( Zucco ) injects his gardener assistant Petro ( Glenn Strange ) with a serum of wolf blood to transform him into a revenge machine . With cunning precision , Cameron launches his creation on a scientist killing spree , taking out his detractors one by one while maintaining a self assured calm , not to mention a perfect alibi for his whereabouts each time . A half dozen years following his wolf man portrayal , Strange would take on the role of the feature creature in 1948's " Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein " . What gives the movie it's most endearing charm however are the neat fog shrouded swamp scenes replete with hanging moss ; for a poverty row effort I don't think I've ever seen it done better . It's the perfect touch for midnight viewings on a dark and stormy night . Let's give some credit to the supporting cast , Anne Nagel as Lenora Cameron , the mad doctor's pretty daughter , who has a bit of a thing for newspaper reporter Tom Gregory ( Johnny Downs ) , hot on the trail of the " beast on two legs " story . Downs is actually top billed over Zucco and Glenn Strange in this effort , though that's highly questionable . One look at Doctor Cameron , and one take of his diabolical laugh is all that's needed to know that it's George Zucco's show all the way . Just turn down the lights for maximum atmosphere , and in Petro's own words , you " ain't got no reason to be afraid " .
368060	2707735	37433	5.0	" I know what happens when you're in a peaceable mood . "	One thing about these old " B " Westerns - the title often had nothing to do with the actual story . Case in point , " Vigilantes of Dodge City " was not a story about vigilantes as one commonly envisions when hearing the term . This film is one of a number of Red Ryder Westerns , the series of films that starred either Allan " Rocky " Lane or Wild Bill Elliott as the title character . The supporting cast generally included Alice Fleming as the Duchess , Red Ryder's aunt who raised him , and trusted young Indian friend Little Beaver . Beaver was portrayed by present day accused wife killer Robert " Baretta " Blake , then credited as Bobby Blake , and sporting a remarkable resemblance to the grown actor . Bill Elliott does the honors as Red Ryder here , and besides helping out with the Dutchess ' Ryder Freight Lines , he raises horses for the Army . Crooked banker Luther Jennings ( LeRoy Mason ) and cohort Bishop ( Wally Wales / Hal Talafiero ) scheme to set up Red with not only robbing the Ryder Freight Lines , but also of defrauding the government by rustling his own horses . Little Beaver plays a key role in this story , when he discovers a hidden cave that serves as headquarters for Jennings and his henchmen . As a fan of these old Westerns , I find it interesting how different cowboy stars handled their six-shooters . Bill Elliott , in the heat of a good showdown , seems to " throw " his gun in the direction of his target as he fires , as if adding emphasis to his action . If you enjoy this film , try some more Elliott Red Ryders , well over a dozen in all , including Sun Valley Cyclone and Sheriff of Redwood Valley . For a different yet similar take on the Ryder character , try Rocky Lane's Rustlers of Devil's Canyon or Marshal of Cripple Creek . All are from the mid 1940's , with the Elliott films preceding the Lane versions . For fans of the early Republic Serials , one of the better ones is The Adventures of Red Ryder from 1940 , starring Don " Red " Barry as the title character . Have fun !
367881	2707735	30159	5.0	" Don't worry boys , we'll split all the medals three ways . "	The draw for this picture would presumably be the character of Wild Bill Hickok , but when all is said and done , the story plays out pretty much like any of hundreds of ' B ' programmers from the Thirties and Forties . George Houston presents a fairly rugged and good looking portrayal of the title character and it's pretty much his picture all the way . Al ( Fuzzy ) St . John is Wild Bill's sidekick , Whiney Roberts , and I have to give some writer credit here ; Whiney does seem to be a cross between a fox terrier and a jackrabbit . The story itself is a fairly standard and typical one for an old Western . Cattle rustlers are stealing large herds and disposing of lawmen sent to investigate , so Wild Bill is called upon to lend his Civil War buddy Steve Norris ( Dave O'Brien ) a hand when his own herd goes missing . When you get right down to it , you have to wonder why Wild Bill was given a nominal partner for this one ; Fuzzy doesn't have much to do here except watch Bill go one on one with the bad guys . At least he's comical to watch . I guess I shouldn't be , but I'm usually surprised to hear how black characters were treated in these old films . There's a party scene at the Norris home where Hickok calls over the black family butler , saying ' Oh , come here boy " . It's a rather innocuous line , but Mantan Moreland is such a great character actor that he's able to brush it off easily enough . I would have liked to see more of him in the picture , but he was only around for a few minutes . That didn't stop him though , from getting in the film's best line in a funny scene with Fuzzy . Neither of them can read , but Moreland has a unique explanation for why he can't read a hand written note - " I can read readin ' , but I can't read writin ' . " You know , I thought about that for a while , and it almost made sense !
367604	2707735	24516	5.0	" You know we ought to give up this racket though , gonna lead us both to a rope necktie one of these days . "	If my count is correct , this is the eleventh Lone Star Film starring John Wayne that I've seen , and it may be the best of the bunch . Not that it doesn't have it's share of gaffs , but it was entertaining and had some humor to lighten the load . Perhaps it was Armand Schaefer's directing hand that accounts for my preference over the ones done by Robert North Bradbury and Harry Fraser . With no pun intended , this could have been an episode of " Alias Smith and Jones " . Wayne's character is John Brant , escaped from prison for a murder he didn't commit ; while making his getaway from the sheriff , he uses the old breathe through a reed trick to remain underwater . When he surfaces to find an outlaw waiting , he hesitates giving his name , whereby " Bob Jones " begins calling him " John Smith " . Lane Chandler shares virtually equal screen time with Wayne in this oater , as the outlaw who committed the crime for which Wayne's character is being hunted . Yakima Canutt is on hand as the outlaw gang leader , and his stunt work in the film is interesting to watch . The most daring one ( as Brant ) is when he's covered by a pile of brush and is positioned to grab the underside of a stagecoach to get on board , while the horses have to carefully straddle him in his prone position . For me , that was a sit up and take notice scene , one that cries out for a " how they made this movie " follow up . Other scenes weren't half as daring , in fact there were two flying horse mounts that almost missed , but with a low budget production that didn't believe in do-overs , they stayed in the film . However there's a great sequence when ( again as Brant ) Yak jumps a hitching post and one horse to land on another horse . It's a good thing the horses cooperated . Since I mentioned the use of humor earlier , I'll note a particular scene when Smith and Jones go shopping at the general store , where they both eye up the pretty Sally Blake ( Nancy Shubert ) for the first time . With a handful of packages each , they manage to break each other's sack of eggs creating a mess . I guess that's why they came up with egg cartons . If you're paying attention , you'll note that when " Smith " gets dressed up to pay a visit to Sally , he removes his old shirt to put on a new one . In the story line , he was shot some two weeks earlier in the left shoulder , but that area shows no sign of damage at all . Could Wayne have been that quick a healer ? In the same scene , and the only time I've ever seen it done , Wayne's character dabs his fingers into the grease of a frying pan to slick back his hair - where's the Vitalis when you need it ! For anyone who's a fan and seen a handful of Wayne's Lone Star films , you'll know how this one ends . Not so much that Smith's name is cleared and the outlaws are brought to justice , but in the fact that John Wayne's character gets the girl . It happens virtually every time , and this one fades on Smith / Brant and Sally in a smooch behind his ten gallon hat .
368210	2707735	33787	5.0	" Why Mr . Bill , this place is zombiefied , but good . "	There's not a lot about this film that makes much sense , but if you're in the mood for some lighthearted comic horror , " King of the Zombies " is a fun stop . The always funny Mantan Moreland is showcased in this one , and has all the best lines in the picture from the word go . Moreland portrays manservant Jefferson Jackson for government agent Bill Summers ( John Archer ) and pilot Jim " Mac " McCarthy ( Dick Purcell ) , who are forced to crash land on a Caribbean Island while in search of a missing Admiral - " Uh-oh , look out Admiral , here we come . " Their plane lands in a graveyard , as Jeff wakes up to a headstone welcome - " Rest in Peace " . From there , the trio make their way to a sufficiently creepy residence , home to a mad doctor named Mikhail Sangre , which is a nice touch as " sangre " is Spanish for blood . The first half of the film involves Moreland's character encountering zombies by way of the kitchen maid Samantha ( Margueite Whitten ) and her cook Tahama ( Madame Sul-Te-Wan ) , who also does double duty as a voodoo high priestess . When Jackson is eventually " zombiefied " himself , it's done for laughs - " Move over boys , I'm one of the gang now . " For his part , Dr . Sangre provides the movie's menace , as he consistently denies the existence of zombies , even while introducing his wife Alyce ( Patricia Stacey ) who walks around in a permanent trance . Sangre is obsessed with the study of hypnotism and " transmigration " , the transfer of souls from dead bodies into live ones . I couldn't help but notice that Sangre's speech pattern resembled a Bela Lugosi knockoff , with Henry Victor's portrayal including some Dracula like flourishes . The movie never really makes much progress as a horror film , and winds up providing a lot more questions than answers . For one , the fate of Alyce Sangre is never revealed by film's end , even though one scene shows her niece Barbara trying to un-hypnotize her . In the movie's finale , Dr . Sangre pumps a number of bullets into the zombiefied pilot McCarthy , but when he comes out of his trance , he's none the worse for wear . And finally , as Sangre backs up from McCarthy's advance , he falls into a fiery burning pit and his doom , but gee , didn't he know it was there ? As do many of the Monogram films of this era , the racial angle is present , and this film is no exception ; in fact there are many references to the black man's condition . Back to the early cemetery scene when Jackson realizes he's not dead , he declares " I thought I was a little off color to be a ghost " . Later , as Dr . Sangre shows the agents where they'll be staying , he remands Jackson to the lower quarters with the black servants , so his staying with the white men doesn't rile the rest of the black staff . It's always interesting to see how these period films handle racism , certainly they were not bashful in presenting them . Monogram in particular frequently threw in a zing , just catch any of their Charlie Chan films with Mantan Moreland as a supporting player , and not only against blacks , as Orientals took their lumps too with the repeated chop suey and egg foo yung remarks . But at least Moreland is given a rare center stage role in " King of the Zombies " . He offers another great line with the movie's closing scene - " If there's one thing that I wouldn't want to be twice , zombies is both of them " . If you , as I can't get past the comic elements of this flick to give it credibility as a horror film , then I only need to point out one final and truly scary fact about his movie - it was nominated for a Best Music Scoring of a Dramatic Picture for the 1942 Oscars - Yikes ! !
368097	2707735	29401	5.0	" Well , would you mind going downstairs and doing it with your wife ? "	I picked up this movie under the re-issue title " Movie Struck " , appropriate enough for the film's premise - a starry eyed Cecilia Moore ( Rosina Lawrence ) longs for a Hollywood career and sees her chance in the " On to Hollywood Beauty and Talent Contest " . Though she wins against a handful of contestants ( among them Miss Gopher City ) , the contest promoter runs off with the prize money , leaving Cecilia in a lurch . A series of fantastic coincidences eventually land Cecilia and her sister Nellie ( Patsy Kelly ) in Hollywood , while Cecilia's would be boy friend Joe Jenkins ( Jack Haley ) masquerades as an important man with connections who conspires to get her a screen test . Rounding out the main cast is Mischa Auer , a debonair Hollywood star who's forte seems to be seducing young , beautiful women . In this case , the casting was a bit off base , as his character Rinaldo Lopez is more a caricature than a romantic leading man . The story itself moves along rather blandly , and Cecilia's big break screen test winds up incredibly boring considering the consequences . What gives the movie it's much needed comic relief are two terrific bits featuring Laurel and Hardy , first as a pair of Mexican bandits in business suits , and later in a funny harmonica duel . Even though you may find this film featuring the comic duo on a video sleeve , their actual screen time is probably less than ten minutes all told . I'd be curious to know if the salon scene is the first in movies to portray an overtly gay male hair dresser ; it's a short scene but the depiction is obvious . With not much in the story of note other then Laurel and Hardy's antics , I'm pressed to give it much more than a lukewarm recommendation . By 1937 , a lot of their best work was already behind them , so it's surprising they weren't used more here . The big winner coming out of the film seems to be Jack Haley , who became the " Wizard of Oz " Tin Man in a couple more years .
368364	2707735	40394	5.0	" Small thing sometimes tell very large story . "	A formerly unproductive gold mine suddenly turns out to be highly profitable ; it's owner Manning insists someone is out to murder him . He turns to Charlie Chan ( Roland Winters ) for help , and the Oriental detective and his two assistants , Number # 2 Son Tommy ( Victor Sen Yung ) and driver Birmingham Brown ( Mantan Moreland ) embark on a pseudo Western adventure . The story is set in Arizona , and to downplay suspicion in their involvement , the Chan party heads off to the Lazy Y Dude Ranch , from where they can keep an eye on developments at the Golden Eye Mine . Sen Yung and Moreland make quite a sight in their Western attire , particularly Birmingham in his buffalo inspired jodhpurs . Tim Ryan is back in a reprise of his role as Lieutenant Mike Ruark ( The Shanghai Chest ) , but this time he's undercover as teetering lush Vincent O'Brien at the Lazy Y . He's there independently , but it turns out his investigation runs parallel to Chan's , so they use the coincidence to hook up . It turns out that the Golden Eye is a pass through for a gold smuggling operation originating in Mexico . The obvious brains of the smuggling gang appears to be the mine's superintendent Driscoll , but as usual for a Chan mystery , the obvious is always done one better , in this case , the mastermind is the handsome local assayer Talbot Bartlett ( Bruce Kellogg ) , who's only too happy to assist Chan in any way he can so that he can throw him off the mark . Bartlett is also busy courting Manning's daughter Evelyn ( Wanda McKay ) to be better positioned to remove the mine's owner from the picture . " The Golden Eye " is an average Charlie Chan mystery , made somewhat more interesting with the comedic bits by Mantan Moreland and the quite effective interplay of Tim Ryan's drunken character O'Brien . If you're a Charlie Chan fan , you'll have to add this one to your list .
368461	2707735	42244	5.0	" Better to have me slap you around than have somebody bore a hole in ya " .	This has all the look of a hastily patched together story , but for Gene Autry fans it's a pretty quick paced and entertaining flick that brings together a number of familiar faces . Pat Buttram shows up not quite mid-way through following a dust up between Gene and a young Hugh O'Brian ! , and goes by the name of Mike Rawley , which seems somewhat unusual to me since he usually went by Pat in Autry's Westerns , at least in the TV series . Buttrams ' character gets some mileage out of a running gag involving Gene's horse Champion and Champ Jr . , which entices him to swear off the bottle . That actually seemed a little bold to this viewer , to have a good guy sidekick admit to having one too many . O'Brian's character is the kind of guy that if this was a biker movie , he'd be the lead tough guy . Except that Gene shoves him around without too much trouble and really isn't challenged by him all that much . Jack Beaumont ( O'Brian ) winds up getting framed for his own father's murder , but one needn't expand on that too much since that's a staple element in dozens of ' B ' Westerns . The guys doing the framing ( James Millican and Don Beddoe ) wind up getting smoked out by Gene , as Rawley is continuously amazed by all the ' firsts ' he experiences as Gene's deputy . And to think , Gene didn't even check his resume . This film finally forced me to get to the bottom of a nickname I've been wondering about for some time . In the story , the character Chip Beaumont , young brother of Jack , is portrayed by a teenage actor named Don Reynolds , who's often credited as ' Brown Jug ' . At least in this picture he was ; in even earlier films he's listed as ' Little Brown Jug ' . Reynolds was the son of a horse trainer and rodeo performer , and made his own rodeo debut at only three years old ! The Reynolds family members all had nicknames , he had cousins named Blackie and Whitie , so Don became Brownie . His father was visiting a man in Texas , and right as they were walking through the door , the Glenn Miller song ' Little Brown Jug ' was playing on the radio . The man exclaimed that here was Fess ( Reynolds ' Dad ) and Little Brown Jug . So now you know the story too ! Keep your eyes open and stay attentive during the story and you'll pick up on a couple of novelties you probably haven't seen before . In the first half of the picture , Gene gets involved with some bank robbers , and the second guy he shoots on horseback throws his right leg over the saddle to his left side before falling off his horse ; I guess he didn't want to hurt himself ! The other has to do with Autry's final showdown against bad guy Rocky Morgan ( Millican ) . Morgan attempts to shoot at Gene aboard Champion , and as Champ bucks up on his hind legs , he knocks Rocky's gun out of his hand ! You know , I never realized it , but Champion is a fantastic looking animal , and for whatever reason , it's strikingly noticeable in this film . You can have some fun with this one , it breezes by pretty quickly and packs a lot of action into it's sixty nine minute run time . Gene characteristically knocks out a couple tunes , one of which comprises the title song - " Beyond The Purple Hills " .
367934	2707735	31051	5.0	" Well I'll be a knock kneed bobcat . "	Set in 1861 Missouri at the outset of the Civil War , it's a toss up as to how the state will side during the great conflict . Officially a Union state , sympathies lie with the Southern cause , and when news of the attack on Fort Sumter breaks , cheers break out for the Confederacy at the garden party of Dr . Jason Bradford . Roy Rogers and Gabby Whittaker ( Gabby Hayes ) are sympathizers who become scouts for the Confederate Army , and their mission is to bring a guerrilla outlaw to justice . Val McBride wears a Confederate uniform , but his band of mercenaries would rather loot Federal supply trains and civilian ranchers , taking advantage of the conflict to enrich themselves . It wasn't unusual for Charlie Chan films of the same era to make racial references , taking jabs at blacks as well as Orientals . This is the first time I've encountered it in a ' B ' Western . There's a scene where Roy enters the Radford home and is greeted by the black maid Mammy Lou . When he comments that she's looking well , Mammy Lou replies - " Maybe I am , but I'm feelin ' kind of pale . " For a good part of the film , Roy tries to convince his friend Dave ( David Allen ) to sever his allegiance with the outlaw McBride , but the easy money is too great a temptation . Dave and Roy share an affection for Dr . Bradford's daughter Laura ( Sally March ) , though the romantic angle doesn't get resolved by the end of the film . In a rarity for these early oaters , the villain also has a female accomplice . Bess Warren ( Dorothy Sebastian ) is McBride's girlfriend , though the relationship is more casual than close . I managed to pick up this film cheaply on DVD along with another Roy Rogers flick on the flip side , " Apache Rose " . Both copies suffered from poor voice and lip synchronization , and this film was a bit blurry besides . Along with that , the story seemed to drag along with drawn out chases and repetitious dialog . Still , if you're a Roy and Gabby fan , there's enough here to tune in . So far it's the only film in which I've seen Roy sing a spiritual as part of his repertoire . For Roy Rogers fans , another film with a Confederate backdrop to consider is " Robin Hood of the Pecos " ; Gabby's along for that ride too . If you take in this film , have some fun and count up how many times Gabby says ' ya durn tootin ' " .
367647	2707735	38422	5.0	" That sounds like trouble . Let's find out . "	" Colorado Serenade " opens and closes with Eddie Dean on horseback singing " Home on the Range " , though he trades partner Roscoe Ates for love interest Sherry Lynn ( Mary Kenyon ) by the end of the film . In between , Eddie and Soapy ( Ates ) help a trouble shooting circuit judge find a long lost son and bring justice to Rawhide City . When you see them both together , it's remarkable how much Dean and Ates look alike , with Roscoe being an older version . The Soapy character was actually Dean's second screen comedic sidekick , Emmett " Pappy " Lynn worked with Eddie in earlier films . In the story , a cowpoke named Nevada ( David Sharpe ) goes undercover to infiltrate a gang that may be robbing gold shipments . At first , Eddie is unaware of Nevada's role , and they really bang it out in a wild saloon fight that's one of the more realistic ones you'll see in a ' B ' Western . Later , it's revealed that the mastermind behind the gold robberies is the same villain who Judge Hilton ( Forrest Taylor ) put in jail thirty years earlier . " Dad " Dillon ( Warner Richmond ) kidnapped the judge's son when he broke out and raised him as his own . " Duke " Dillon is now the town boss of Rawhide City , who'll learn his true origin just before he eats dust at the hands of " Dad " . Eddie Dean began his film career in the mid 1930's , appearing in back up roles to Hopalong Cassidy . Prior to that , he made his mark as part of a singing trio on Gene Autry's Melody Ranch Radio Program . Dean has his backers that will claim he was the best of the singing cowboys , and that's probably not far from the truth . " Colorado Serenade " showcases his talent quite well with a host of songs , and he finishes one up with a low key yodel . While many movie cowboys were synonymous with their horses , Dean chose to appear with four different steeds in his films , on the assumption that he wouldn't be upstaged by any of them . His mount in this picture is a palomino named White Cloud . Actually , Dean had a reputation for being fairly generous with his fellow actors , allowing them center stage when the story called for it . A final bit of trivia - though other Westerns were made before in color , Eddie Dean was the first to do a series of films in color , with five films for PRC in the 1940's . On that account , he managed to beat Roy and Gene to the draw .
367914	2707735	23456	5.0	" You stand in the shadow of - The Eagle . "	Right up front , I'm not a big fan of the serial format . However when I saw a three DVD set of John Wayne's serials from the early 1930's , picking them up was a no brainer , especially for the price - under ten dollars . I watched " The Shadow Of The Eagle " today in a couple of sessions , and it was with a lot of patience and deliberation that I made it all the way through , no mean feat for the run time of 218 minutes . I say all that having now seen most of John Wayne's early Westerns from the Lone Star and Republic days ; those movies run the gamut from poor to fairly entertaining given the era and Wayne's own early appearances in them . The serials predate those by at least a couple of years , so you can't fault The Duke himself for the product as much as the writing , directing and technology of an earlier time . Still , there's so much goofy stuff going on in ' Shadow ' that it's easy to understand why they were shown in twenty minute sessions a week apart . The story involves Wayne's character Craig McCoy , who intervenes on behalf of carnival owner Nathan Gregory ( Edward Hearn ) , a former World War I flier nicknamed ' The Eagle ' . Presumed dead after being shot down in the war , five of his remaining buddies team up to form an aircraft company , reaping huge profits from an invention Gregory designed . The story follows McCoy's attempt to retrieve the original design plans , while a new ' Eagle ' attempts to turn the former partners against each other , presumably to become the sole survivor and beneficiary of the lucrative invention . What's unique about the story is that the ' Eagle ' uses a remote control airplane to sky write cryptic messages and warnings meant to intimidate the principals of the Evans Aero Corp . By the time it's all over , every member of the group has been fingered at least once as the primary villain ; not only that , but ' The Eagle ' uses a pair of agents to further confound the plot by virtue of kidnapping , theft and other general mayhem . One of then is Wayne's long time collaborator , stunt man and buddy , Yakima Canutt , as an Eagle henchman named Boyle . This might be the only time you'll ever get to see Yak in a suit and tie ! In addition to the standard cliffhanger endings for each chapter play , you also have Wayne engaging in fisticuffs with one villain or another in each segment . Sometimes he's aided by the carnival strongman ( Ivan Linow ) , or as he's called by carny midget Billy ( Little Billy Rhodes ) , the big palooka . Oddly , the carnival atmosphere doesn't figure much in the proceedings , although one of the chapter endings takes place on a ferris wheel , with McCoy about to fall to his demise . He makes the comeback the next time around with a trapeze like save . I should also mention that a pretty female was also at the center of the action most of the time , Colonel Gregory's daughter Jean ( Dorothy Gulliver ) . In virtually every one of Wayne's early Westerns , the female lead wound up as a romantic interest for his character , but not here . I found that kind of odd actually , especially since he had twelve chances . One of the more exciting and innovative sequences involved Wayne and his co-star in a ' North by Northwest ' style airplane chase to close out the first chapter , it made me wonder if Hitchcock might have seen it ! So what was the goofiest scene in the movie ? There's a sequence in Chapter Nine when Wayne's character and sidekick Henry , a ventriloquist ( James Bradbury Jr . ) take off in a car chase , and shortly into it , the Eagle's henchmen Moore and Boyle ( Bud Osborne and Canutt ) suddenly just appear on the vehicle in motion - how'd they do that ? The movie was directed by Ford Beebe , whose name I've heard before , but I'm not familiar with his work , though it looks like he did a fair number of serials . Fortunately for John Wayne's career , he managed to hook up with another director named Ford starting with his 1939 break out film " Stagecoach " . Wayne's overnight success came after roughly fifty movies !
368542	2707735	31125	5.0	" On my record darling , you're justified in expecting battle , murder and sudden death . "	The long playing wedding scenario between Captain Hugh Drummond ( John Howard ) and fiancé Phyllis Clavering ( Heather Angel ) manages to get within one hour of the ceremony in this outing , but not before another adventure gets in the way . This time the action stays local , as a scatterbrained professor intrigues Drummond with a tale of treasure hidden somewhere at his palatial Rockingham Tower . A long shot of the Tower reveals a rather imposing structure , made to order for the creepy fun that's about to follow . In the early going , Miss Clavering's Aunt Blanche makes it a point to remind Phyllis of the five previous failed attempts to make it to the altar . Obviously this had an impact on Drummond , as he relives those events in a dream sequence , unable to get a good night's sleep on the eve of his wedding . With the prospect of a million pound fortune somewhere close by , it's a safe bet that the marriage will be put on hold once again . This time , the villain of the piece is Leo ( minus the ' G ' ) Carroll . He impersonates a butler named Boulton hired for the wedding occasion , but is really Henry Seton , arrested three years earlier for the attempted theft of papers held by Professor Downie ( Forrester Harvey ) . Just released from prison , Seton's timing is perfect . He dispatches Downie and begins to solve the cipher that leads to the treasure . For all the mystery involving the cipher , it comes as a bit of a letdown that it simply involves a reverse alphabet . The hunt for the treasure leads Seton and his unwilling captive Miss Clavering into an underground series of murky caverns beneath Rockingham Tower . Harry Potter would have been inspired by what he found there , the secretive ' Tower of Water ' and ' Chamber of Spikes ' . With Drummond and Company in hot pursuit , the hapless villain manages to discover the hidden treasure only to lose it just as quickly . Seton becomes distracted in a rather inept cat and mouse game with Miss Clavering over control of a lever that operates a trap door gate meant to keep Drummond's gang at bay . As usual , Captain Hugh Drummond finds himself aided by his regular cast ; Reginald Denny , E . E . Clive and H . B . Warner in the role of Colonel Nielson of Scotland Yard . If you've seen all the Drummond adventures up till now , you'll wonder if Nielson has anything else to do besides serving as Drummond's personal attaché . At least Nielson provides the rationale for the movie's title when Drummond assigns areas of Rockingham to his accomplices for inspection ; it was then that the Colonel referred to themselves as the ' secret police ' . For at least the third time in a Bulldog Drummond film , the old lights out trick is used when Seton / Boulton attempts to get his hands on the diary containing the cryptic cipher . That lack of originality and the aforementioned clumsiness in dealing with Miss Clavering seemed to undermine his threat as a villain . Too bad he couldn't swim either . Too bad also the way the film ended ; for all the time spent pining for her long delayed wedding , it's Miss Clavering who disappears this time when Algy's Molotov cocktail explodes during the wedding rehearsal , compliments of a rigged bottle of Mountain Mary Scotch . The finale didn't make much sense except to justify one more sequel . I wonder what happens in " Bulldog Drummond's Bride " !
368465	2707735	33144	6.0	" Listen , you see things those white boys don't see . . . "	The East Side Kids films would often use the boxing ring as the focus of their stories , but the sport dealt with here is horse racing , as Muggs Maloney ( Leo Gorcey ) fancies himself a championship rider . When an itinerant black trainer and his horse find temporary shelter at the abandoned Acme Stable , Muggs and his gang befriend the old gentleman and start getting Blue Knight ready for a successful payday . Muggs however is a tenuous rider , and is seen as a drawback for Blue Knight's success . The story gets some mileage out of Muggs defending himself against ' back out ' talk from the horse's financial backers , as well as East Sider Danny ( Bobby Jordan ) . He even gets to mix it up with one of his racing idols , Jimmy Sullivan ( Nick Wall ) , before it finally sinks in that maybe it's the right thing to do . That's where the story gets interesting for me . The East Side Kids films and others of the era , like the Charlie Chan series , often used black characters for comic relief and as denigrating stereotypes . This one though , contains two unique scenes that seem to be an attempt to address the stereotype and convey sympathy for the black character . The first is when Scruno ( Sunshine Sammy Morrison ) and Ben ( Clarence Muse ) discuss what they see as fear in Muggs ' behavior when riding Blue Knight . Scruno's observation is dead on , and Ben answers with the comment in my summary above ; to me it was taken as an insightful observation by someone who had known fear himself . The other scene comes across more forcefully , and looked like it might have been groundbreaking for it's time . When Ben himself questions Muggs about riding to win , Muggs ' anger surfaces and he slaps the black man in the face . White teenage aggression slaps down the uppity Negro . It was an awkward moment , and it left me wondering how the scene might have played for it's audience of the time . Immediately after , realizing what he's done , Muggs challenges Ben to fight back and beat him ; not so much to defend himself , but to beat the fear out of Muggs , who now realizes it for himself . Later , a redemptive moment occurs when Muggs saves Ben from a fire , and the two embrace in friendship , realizing that they really needed each other all along . All that said , it's notable to mention I've seen Clarence Muse in only two other films , 1936's " Daniel Boone " and 1941's " Invisible Ghost " . However in both pictures , his subservient role is handled respectfully and with dignity . The thought just occurred that he might have been the Morgan Freeman of his era . Of course , as all the East Side Kids stories do , this one ends on a successful note , with Blue Knight winning the big race finale in a photo finish . Muggs isn't part of that decision , but he doesn't have to be . It's a classy ending where making a tough decision winds up being the right one for everyone to come out a winner .
368253	2707735	32312	6.0	" Hey , that fella can shoot ! "	The Carson City Kid ( Roy Rogers ) is on a quest to find the man that murdered his brother , and that trail brings him to Sonora and the Olive Branch Saloon , owned by crooked card shark Lee Jessup ( Bob Steele ) . Although a hero in most of his films , Steele offers a characterization here of a villain you just love to hate , a smarmy , underhanded cheat who can't be greedy enough . George " Gabby " Hayes portrays Marshal Gabby Whitaker , who claims to have ridden with the " Kid " at one time and knows him on sight . That gag gets to be played out a number of times in the film , with Rogers grinning his way through each attempt by Gabby to continue the charade . Rounding out the cast is Noah Beery Jr . as a loose lips prospector who impersonates the Carson City Kid in order to retrieve the money he lost to Jessup in a rigged card game . And as usual , there's a romantic interest - Pauline Moore as saloon singer Joby Madison who catches Rogers ' eye and later does some catching of her own . Rogers and Moore also teamed up in " Colorado " , released in the same year , 1940 . " Carson City Kid " is a fast paced film coming in at just fifty seven minutes , and manages to include the standard gunfight , posse chase and rope across the trail trick . A 1940 Republic film , it holds up as one of the more entertaining of the early Roy Rogers Westerns .
368250	2707735	33781	6.0	" Aw , poison ivy , now you made me say a rash word . "	Abbott and Costello follow up their first two service films ( " Buck Privates " and " In the Navy " ) with this comedy offering where they enter the U . S . Army Air Corps with fellow " woman hater " Jinx Roberts ( Dick Foran ) . Foran portrays a sideshow stunt pilot whose flying escapades usually get him in trouble , and his latest acrobatics get him fired from his job . With his buddies in tow , all three wind up at the Cal-Aero Academy where the fun begins . Notably absent from this Abbott and Costello installment are the Andrews Sisters and Shemp Howard . The singing duties are picked up by a trio of supporting stars , starting with Linda Joyce ( Carol Bruce ) who gives us " I'm Getting Sentimental Over You " . Martha Raye offers a spirited rendition of " Peg Foot Pete " and even Dick Foran gets into the act with " Let's Keep ' Em Flying " . Martha Raye is a welcome addition to the cast , actually portraying a pair of sisters , Gloria and Barbara Phelps . The lunch counter scene introduces her ( them ? ) when Blackie ( Bud ) and Heathcliff ( Lou ) order a turkey sandwich between them . Raye characterizes each sister with a different attitude and voice , and really keeps the boys on their toes . As the film progresses , the sisters strike up a romantic interest with the boys , with Heathcliff hilariously missing all the romantic signals sister Gloria throws his way . The movie wouldn't be complete without some sort of Abbott and Costello mayhem , this time out it's provided by a runaway torpedo and a barnstorming airplane finale where Heathcliff spends most of his time outside the plane hanging on for dear life . By film's end , Foran's character gets to redeem himself by coming to the aid of a parachutist in trouble , who's chute remained attached to the plane he was making his jump from . Grounded from flying earlier in the movie , Jinx disobeys orders once again by hijacking his own plane and charging to the rescue to save the man's life . Come to think of it though , when Jinx entered the Air Corps , how was it that his own personal plane signed up for the hitch too ?
368411	2707735	37627	6.0	" Speaking of politics , where we're going there are only two parties , the quick and the dead . "	It's interesting to follow John Wayne's career progress , from the early Lone Star Western days up through the leading roles he's most famous for in the Sixties and Seventies . Here , in " Dakota " , and in other films of the era , he probably appeared at his best in terms of rugged good looks and athletic skill . He cuts an impressive figure , particularly with leading lady Vera Ralston by his side to smooth out the rougher edges . The film itself isn't particularly noteworthy for it's story line , a theme that's been done time and again in the genre . Evil land grabbers attempt to swindle hard working honest folks out of their wheat farms just before the railroad comes through so they can cash in for the quick kill . Ward Bond portrays the main bad guy with subtle malice as he engineers the land swindle , while pro boxer / wrestler / strong man Mike Mazurki is his top henchman . Bond's character Jim Bender in particular is a much smoother characterization than one is used to seeing in these types of oaters ; more than one wheat farmer commented on how honest he seemed to be with his calm demeanor and dialog . The picture gets off to a wild start as John Devlin ( Wayne ) elopes with Sandy Poli ( Ralston ) , as they manage to outrun her father who disapproves of the already completed marriage . In a well crafted scene , Marko Poli ( Hugo Haas ) turns the tenor of the early story on a dime as he comically attempts to send off a telegram to the daughter that got away . The scene sets the stage for additional comic relief , primarily supplied by Walter Brennan in a wonderful portrayal of the ' River Bird ' Captain Bounce . Most of the time Bounce can be heard talking to himself in the colorful language he's known for , and it's a hoot to catch his antics , particularly in the grounded riverboat scene . Nick Stewart is the captain's sidekick , his gimmick is a constant handkerchief wipe of face and brow that signals a nervous twitch . His black character is somewhat stereotypical in presentation , but not as racially charged as mentioned elsewhere in this forum . Probably the worst that can be said about it is that it resembles a ' Step ' n Fetchit ' type of portrayal , though it comes in handy for Wayne's character later in the story to signal the bad guys on the move . There's a neat device near the finale when Devlin goes after Collins ( Mazurki ) . While pushing through the door of the cabin , Devlin pulls Collins ' hat down over his face prior to bashing him . That's a move I hadn't seen before . Probably the most unusual and in it's way most refreshing element of the story is the way Ralston's character keeps one step ahead of her new husband by pulling the strings on their future together . With his eye set on California , Devlin never makes it as the Mrs . manages to shanghai his plans every step along the way . It's also on that note that the movie ends , with the Captain's refurbished riverboat horn drowning out Devlin's protest against another one of her manufactured schemes .
367665	2707735	22243	6.0	" I never thought I'd have to kill a man , but it may be that I will . "	Considering the release of this film on the early threshold of the talkie film era , and with the hindsight of a couple hundred Western films under my belt , I was rather surprised by the originality of some of the scenes presented here . The opening sequence almost suggests that it IS a silent film , until broken by the cry of an abandoned baby in a covered wagon , discovered by a pair of codgers named Cash Holbrook and Jeff Cameron ( William Farnum and J . Farrell MacDonald ) . At odds over who'll bring him up , Cash takes the baby and heads West with ' Bill ' . Fast forward some twenty years , the baby has grown into Bill Boyd , or at least his character , Bill Holbrook . At the time of the movie , Boyd at age thirty six looks somewhat heavier around the middle than he would as his alter ego , Hopalong Cassidy . Bill attempts to get the former friends to reconcile their disagreement that has grown increasingly bitter over the years . When Bill discovers tungsten ore on Cameron's property , he throws in with the Cameron's to develop a mining operation and get closer to Miss Mary Ellen ( Helen Twelvetrees ) . Most self references to " The Painted Desert " use the opportunity to promote the movie as the first speaking role for Clark Gable . The actor acquits himself reasonably well , though he's given the task of being a no good slimy polecat who attempts to further undermine the relationship of the former partners , and derail the budding romance between Bill and Mary Ellen . You can tell his acting is a bit forced , especially in the final confrontation with Bill when he outs himself . As others have mentioned , the lack of typical Western style action is apparent , but what makes the film difficult for a lot of viewers is that every . . . spoken . . . word . . . and . . . sentence . . . is . . . followed . . . by . . . a . . . pause . . . that's . . . so . . . looooong . With normal dialog , the film probably could have clocked in at under an hour . To my mind though , the final scene presenting the showdown between the senior Holbrook and Cameron is entirely original and one I've never seen before . Realistic too , in that handguns of the era depicted were never accurate beyond a distance of about twenty five feet . I won't spoil it for you , though Bill Boyd figures in the outcome . Let's just say he'll be a little late for his wedding .
367598	2707735	45469	6.0	" I'm doin ' all the drinkin ' and you turn into a mouse . "	By the time they were through , Abbott and Costello got to mix it up with just about all of Universal Studios ' iconic monsters ; here they take their mayhem over to England to exchange pleasantries with Boris Karloff and his portrayal of Dr . Jekyll and Mr . Hyde . Karloff has a turn at a variation of the Wolfman gimmick , becoming the Hyde monster whenever he injects himself with a drug designed to do just that . He's been experimenting with concoctions that turn people into animals , and before it's all over , Lou Costello winds up as a large mouse and a derby wearing version of Hyde himself . As in many of their films there's also a romantic angle , this time with Helen Westcott and Craig Stevens doing the honors , to the consternation of Dr . Jekyll . Vicky Edwards ( Westcott ) has been Jekyll's ward since childhood , and he fancies himself a candidate to be her husband . This May / December match up is not going to work , so Jekyll figures to make things rough for Bruce Adams ( Stevens ) in the romance department . The London police department is turned on it's ear in search of monsters showing up all over the city after Tubby ( Lou ) takes a syringe full of serum . Having seen this film many years ago as a kid , the one bit I remembered best was the rooftop scene with Slim ( Bud ) , Adams , and the two Mr . Hydes doing the gag around the chimney . It was just one of the many scenarios requiring orchestrated timing , a hallmark of their comedies . This was Abbott and Costello's second screen pairing with the legendary Boris Karloff , the first time was in 1949's " A and C Meet the Killer " . Oddly , Karloff did not reprise the role he created for " A and C Meet Frankenstein " , believing that spoofing his creation wouldn't sell audiences . Even in the Jekyll and Hyde movie , he seems to carry an air that wants to rise above the slapstick . For Bud and Lou though , the gimmicks don't run out until the very end , when in the final scene the police inspector ( Reginal Denny ) and four of his men all become Hyde monsters after taking a " wolfman " bite from Tubby - Yikes ! !
367871	2707735	44936	6.0	" The crew's below , all I have to do is sober them up . "	Not a bad little actioner here for a movie that doesn't go feature length . It doesn't start out as a pirate adventure but turns into one when Hook ( Gene Evans ) and Redlegs ( Rhys Williams ) learn of plans to smuggle ten million dollars worth of gold back to the States during the War of 1812 . Captain James Marshall ( Mark Stevens ) is commissioned to run a British blockade and head off to France to pick up the privately funded stash , and takes along disgraced former seaman Ben Waldridge ( Patric Knowles ) . The film really gets going when Waldridge stows his paramour Leslie ( Angela Lansbury ) aboard the Concord , setting up a tension that sails on for the rest of the story . The surprise of the film for me was Lansbury , never realizing she was as pretty as she appears here . That's balanced by how totally despicable her character is , a gold digger who'll use Waldridge and anyone else in her path to live a life of luxury . Her ' ten million or nothing ' ultimatum to rogue Waldridge hints at a suitable demise for her character when it's time , and this viewer found himself counting the minutes . But not before she attempts to write a little murder of her own into the script . The film's finale makes use of an early hand crank wooden submarine that's almost comical in it's concept except for the fact that it works . It provides the dubious opportunity for Captain Waldridge , in a redemptive moment , to go down with the ship . I picked up this film as part of a ten movie / three DVD compilation simply called " Pirates " from St . Clair Vision . The print of the film I viewed addresses the concerns of two other reviewers for the movie on this site . It appeared to be a pretty good print without the scratchy quality attributed to it , while also appearing in it's original Technicolor format . For a lazy rainy morning , it was just the ticket .
367987	2707735	45012	6.0	" See her face , a real honest face , only disgusting thing about her . "	I'm sure this was the wrong choice for a first time viewing of the fabled Tracy / Hepburn team , about a third of the way in I was scratching my head over just about everything in the film . With awkward pacing , stilted dialog and prolonged sporting sequences that eventually wear out their welcome , I had trouble reconciling the inadequacy of the script with the presence of it's principal players , under the direction no less of the talented George Cukor . The set up is plausible enough , allowing an athletic Katherine Hepburn to show off her tennis and golf skills while building self esteem and confidence to make the break from a domineering fiancée . Considering their entire lack of chemistry however , that didn't require much of a stretch . I found Collier Weld ( William Ching ) to be no less than completely annoying in every scene , made even more so by his uncanny resemblance to Peter Graves . The trouble is , I really didn't detect any chemistry between Mike Conovan ( Tracy ) and Pat Pemberton ( Hepburn ) either . When the most he could muster in the way of a compliment was " That sure is a pretty dress covering you " , I managed a silent groan , later to be topped by Mike's dismissal of Collier - " You are the wrong jockey for this chick " . Can you imagine Cary Grant being given lines like this ; I'm so relieved that he didn't appear in this one . And was anyone else as uncomfortable as I was when Hepburn had those ' licking ' conversations with Davie Hucko ( Aldo Ray ) and her promoter ? Even the theatrical trailers for this film wouldn't have enticed me to catch this back in 1952 . The animated teaser trailer plays like an era toothpaste commercial , while the Aldo Ray introduced clip would more likely convince me to avoid the movie altogether . Speaking of Aldo Ray , I'm sure he must have had something that recommended him for future film work , he was hilarious in 1955's " We're No Angels " . However here he's co-billed as ' that new sensation ' , but quite honestly , he comes off as a big lug . Back to the trailer , if you watch Ray's eyes , you can see him moving them back and forth as he reads his lines promoting the film . Probably the best thing in the movie for me was catching a slew of future stars making spot appearances throughout the film , starting with Jim Backus in the golf shop . By this time however , Carl ' Alfalfa " Switzer is almost totally unrecognizable from his ' Our Gang ' days ( he's the busboy who makes it to the police station ) . Chuck Connors has a prominent introduction in his first screen appearance as the State Police Captain , while a young Chuck Bushinski shows up as one of Conovan's questionable business ' investors ' . It's a nice little role for the future Charles Bronson . Keep your eye on the back wall of the police station , you'll be able to make out a set of instructions for dealing with intoxicated drivers - " Establish Positive Identification When Using the Drunk Repeater Cards " . Don't take my swipe at the film as a total put down , it's just that I didn't find a lot in it that worked , even for the early 1950's . Especially having just seen the decade earlier pairing of Hepburn and director Cukor in " The Philadelphia Story " . I understand that Hepburn wanted Spencer Tracy as one of the leads in that film , but as it turns out , I think it's better they waited .
368308	2707735	29462	6.0	" Don't you know he could shoot the buttons off your shirt ? "	From Republic Pictures , " Range Defenders " is a Three Mesquiteers Western that teams up Robert Livingston , Ray Corrigan and Max Terhune . When George Brooke ( Thomas Carr ) is framed for murder by town boss John Harvey ( Harry Woods ) , it's up to his brother Stony ( Livingston ) and his buddies to clear his name and bring Harvey and his henchmen to justice . Though fairly formulaic , the film has a few unique moments to keep it interesting , along with the romantic angle provided by female lead Sylvia Ashton ( Eleanor Stewart ) and Stony . The good guys plan to challenge Harvey's grip on Green Valley by having Tucson Smith ( Corrigan ) run for sheriff against Dan Gray ( Earl Hodgins ) . Gray's in league with Harvey , so the boys will have to work fast to prevent George from being railroaded into a noose . Tucson and Lullaby ( Terhune ) round up the cattle ranchers to gain their support , while Harvey's henchmen , in a burst of civic pride , vote early and often . Max Terhune provides the comic relief for the Mesquiteers ; he does a clever ventriloquist routine with a dummy that puts crooked sheriff Gray on the defensive . That's in between trying to dodge a charging ram on the Ashton ranch . Pay attention during the scene when Harvey locks Sylvia in a back room of his office when the action starts to break . To escape from a window about three or four feet above her head , she climbs up on a table after breaking the window with a chair . However when she lands in the street standing erect , her head is above the lower window ledge ! In true ' B ' Western fashion , the good guys wear white and the bad guys wear black . That's particularly relevant when George breaks out of jail and runs into the bad guys wearing light colored outfits , thereby being captured once again . Town boss Harvey must have had a dress code for his bad boys , they all wear exactly the same thing , including the light colored band around their black hats . You won't see this very often , but near the end of the story , Tucson uses a stick of dynamite to stop Harvey on horseback in his tracks as he attempts a getaway . Tucson could shoot the buttons off your shirt , and he proved just as accurate with TNT . Republic Studios made quite a few Three Mesquiteers adventures , with a whole host of cowboy stars , including Bob Steele , Tim McCoy , Tom Tyler , Ray Hatton , and believe it or not , even John Wayne following his Lone Star film days . Livingston , Corrigan and Terhune seem to have appeared in most of them as a trio , though they did trade off with others as necessary . " Range Defenders " has a unique distinction in that it's title pretty much accurately describes the story , which wasn't always the case with Westerns of the era . It breezes by pretty quickly in just under an hour , and doesn't wear out it's welcome even if it uses a tried and true formula .
368192	2707735	22676	6.0	" Oh that place , take it easy Sonny , this rushin ' will come in handy after you get there . "	Perhaps to underscore the quick pace of life in New York , " Big City Blues " moves along at a hectic sixty three minute pace , and tries to cram as much action as it can into that amount of time . Willow Station railroad agent ( Grant Mitchell ) has been there and done that , and bets a ten spot with a buddy that anxious traveler Bud Reeves ( Eric Linden ) will be back within a month . For his part , Bud is flush with enthusiasm and eleven hundred dollars and ready to make his mark on the big town . He's met by fast talking cousin " Gibby " Gibboney ( Walter Catlett ) , who has a knack for getting others to pay his way , and completely monopolizes the conversation in every scene he's in . He's on a first name basis with a few up and coming showgirls , particularly cute Vida Fleet ( Joan Blondell ) , who immediately becomes fond of the rube from Hoopersville , Indiana . Things move a bit too fast though , as Gibby organizes a welcome party for Bud in his room at the Hotel Hercules , and all manner of show biz types begin to arrive , among them Shep Adkins ( Humphrey Bogart ) . Shep is about to move in on Len Scully's ( Lyle Talbot ) girl , Lenny objects with his fists , and a brawl breaks out that leaves the young showgirl dead . Not knowing what to do , young Bud follows the example of everyone else at the party , he high tails it before the law can arrive . Night watchman Hummel ( Guy Kibbee ) revels in his five minutes of fame for finding the dead victim , while detective Quelkin ( Thomas Jackson ) tails Vida who he hopes can lead him to Bud Reeves , guilty until proved innocent . By accident , Hummel solves the case by going for his whiskey bottle in the hotel linen closet , where he finds Scully's body , a suicide victim with a shard of the broken bottle that neatly fits with the piece recovered by the police . Back at Willow Station , it only takes the railroad agent three days to collect on his bet , as Bud gratefully touches down on home turf . He still has visions of grandeur for life in New York , but has grown up enough to have some patience for it . Maybe next time , things will work out a bit better . By 1932 , Humphrey Bogart had a handful of movie credits to his name , but nothing significant as of yet . That was about to change with his next film , " Three on a Match " , which also co-starred Joan Blondell . Both would work together two more times , in 1936's " Bullets or Ballots " with Edward G . Robinson , and the 1937 comedy " Stand-In " . All are recommended for fans of either , while " Bullets or Ballots " is a fine early example of the mobster genre made popular by films like " Public Enemy " and " White Heat " .
367681	2707735	79094	6.0	" Shoot your little stick my heathen friend . . . "	It's not likely you'll catch a Western like this again , good guys and bad guys have little meaning here . Martin Sheen and Sam Waterston are pitted against each other as an ex-foot soldier versus a Kiowa warrior , and the mismatch is palpable throughout . There's a great innovative scene where White Bull ( Waterston ) emerges from a waterhole to ambush Pike ( Sheen ) , in the tradition of your best horror film surprises . That's one of the highlights in a story that ofttimes meanders back and forth with little action . At one point , Waterston is featured in a great Iron Eyes Cody profile that attests to his regal bearing , which director Anthony Harvey uses to tease a possible romantic involvement between the Indian and his captive blonde beauty ( Caroline Langrish ) . That story line goes nowhere , but draws on more than a single exchange of amorous glances between the two . Martin Sheen gets to inject some humor into the cat and mouse game with some of the few lines of dialog the film actually uses ; for his part , White Bull remains entirely silent throughout . It complements his mysterious nature , and the ruse with the tricked out dagger that takes out the thieving Mexican was a nice touch . Sheen does a remarkable job convulsing from that arrow to the leg from White Bull , so much so that you feel his pain . In the set up for the horseback duel finale , one expects a decisive outcome without knowing who'll win , but again , your standard Western conventions don't bear out . White Bull acknowledges Pike's temerity and allows him to live , and his thundering dust cloud ride into the sunset sets both men free . The ending though , managed to elicit an unintended chuckle just like Vincent Price does in the closing sequence of " The Fly " , when Judith and Pike separately plead their case to the heavens - " Please , help me " .
368181	2707735	60049	6.0	" Of course we know the dead don't come back to life " .	With a title like " Terror Creatures From the Grave " , you would think the picture would be an exercise in campy horror and cheesy special effects . But you know , this was actually a pretty neat little creep fest , and for it's relatively compact run time of just under an hour and a half , the picture offers some of the best lines you'll ever come up with in a ' B ' grade horror flick . For example : " Are you putting me in the torture room ? " - Albert Kovac to Cleo Hauff " I've summoned them from their graves and now I'm among them . " - the voice of Jeronimus Hauff " The corpse collectors always come when somebody's doomed . " - the library clerk " The living I may fear , but certainly not the dead . " - Kovac againTop all of that off with one of the most innovative suicide / hari kari scenes ever , and you've got a unique little excursion into dementia cinema that would be hard to top . I read with some interest the other reviews on this film by other posters , and I have to wonder why I'm in the minority on the following point . Most take it as a given that Jeronimus Hauff was actually dead , and came back from the beyond to take out his revenge on the five witnesses to his purported death a year earlier . But what about that scene when the servant Kurt laid the body of Hauff on the stone tablet , bewailing the loss of his master ? Hmmm .
368235	2707735	26867	6.0	" An interesting example of antediluvian Americana . "	My experience of " The Phantom Empire " comes from the two hour movie pieced together from the twelve chapter serial , so admittedly , there is much I didn't get to see . To say that the film is unique is an understatement ; where else do you have a Western blending with sci-fi and dating back to 1935 ? Gene Autry stars in one of his earliest films , hosting a daily broadcast adventure with his Radio Riders . He's also assisted by Frankie and Betsy Baxter ( Frankie Darro and Betsy King Ross ) , who are the young leaders of the National Thunder Riders Association . The group is fashioned along the lines of the Boy Scouts , taking their name from the thundering sound of horses ridden by an underground race called the Muranians . Viewers are also treated to an early pairing of Gene with a very young Smiley Burnette , though his screen time is limited as one of Gene's Radio Ranch singers . As typical with " B " Westerns and serials of the era , the emphasis is on action and danger , here provided by unscrupulous men who invade Gene's ranch because of radium discovered there . Meanwhile underground , the action on the ranch is monitored by Queen Tika of the Muranians ( Dorothy Christy ) , who must protect her stronghold from the people of the surface world , while at the same time fending off a revolutionary advance by one of her ministers , High Chancellor Argo ( Wheeler Oakman ) . Science fiction tangles with science fact at all levels here , and it's a hoot trying to make sense of it . For example , the elevator that transports the Muranians back and forth travels a distance of 25 , 000 feet in about three seconds , that translates to about 6 , 000 miles per hour ! However there's one very interesting statement made by Queen Tika that proves to be entirely prophetic - " Get the captain of the Thunder Riders on the wireless cell phone ! " Before it's all over , Gene escapes from such terrors as the D-Ray Lithium Gun and the Chamber of Death , while impersonating a Muranian himself along the way . He obviously takes his role seriously , pay attention to an early scene when he's shot off his horse ; he hangs on to his hat while tumbling all the way down a hillside . If you don't have the patience for the five hour serial , the recently made available DVD from Digiviews offers a reasonable alternative , though purists may not think so . However the gist of the Phantom Empire experience is presented well enough here with acceptable quality , and enough songs by Gene Autry to make your viewing time worthwhile .
367583	2707735	712598	6.0	" Well , stabbing Mr . Block was serious , wasn't it ? "	I can't say I wasn't entertained by this Westinghouse Studio One presentation , but thinking about it now , the story leaves one with a lot of head scratching . The stolen letter at the heart of the story ( along with the murder ) was never recovered , and the murderer was too dumb to move away from the boarding house before the police closed in . Stuff like this passed for quality entertainment back in the early days of television , and this was certainly an imaginative story with it's twists and turns , but ultimately , it's value today lies in being a curiosity piece . Think about this for a minute - the landlady's husband , Mr . Gerard , returns home after being gone for six years , and surreptitiously ' borrows ' clothes from the rooming house tenants . Later , police lieutenant Henley reveals that Gerard , for all that time , was living three blocks over and nine blocks down from his wife and son . Gerard brushes it off to amnesia , and says he'll write a book about it ! The cool thing for me here was seeing Robert Sterling a couple of years before his run on the ' Topper ' TV series in which he portrayed one half of a comedy ghost couple with the lovely Anne Jeffreys . The other redeeming feature of the presentation was Robert Emhardt as the apartment bound tenant , Otis Block , victim of the ' murder over cheese ' mystery . Cheese it was , even if the world's best Edam . Story aside , if you pick this up as part of the Mill Creek Entertainment Mystery Collection , you'll be treated to a couple of the most eye opening commercials ever from the early Fifties . Westinghouse was it's own sponsor of course , touting the likes of it's line of air conditioning units . But for pure grins , wait till you get a load of the ' Biggest Bargain of the Year ' - the NEW big screen TV set , available with trade-in allowance on your old set ! - and costing you only the price of two theater tickets per month in payments ! Who could resist that offer ?
368171	2707735	51901	6.0	" By the looks of you , I'd say you hired a gunman . "	This was my first look at Macdonald Carey and I can't say I was very impressed with his role as the gunman who cleans up Dutch Flats . He showed none of the charisma of a Western hero , and it didn't help that the mystique of his quick gun hand was regarded as some kind of supernatural hex placed on his Colt Wesson . 44 . The film could have gotten a little more mileage out of that plot element but it really didn't get the right treatment . I got the same impression as a prior reviewer on this board , and quite independently came up with a ' Twilight Zone ' type link between the gun and the spooky music that celebrated each victim . The romantic link with Audrey Totter's character also didn't seem quite right to me ; at least Smith ( Carey ) figured out that she was really the one pulling the strings against the Corleys . You know what really struck me as supernatural though ? How did old man Corley know Smith / Yancey gunned his boys down when he just got in to town ?
368067	2707735	44040	6.0	" What do you care whose gun it is as long as it isn't aimed at you ? "	It's interesting to see who Humphrey Bogart is paired up with in his films following the Warner Brothers days . This time out it's Lee J . Cobb as a French colonel and Swedish actress Marta Toren . The story takes place in 1925 Syria , as French forces operating under a United Nations mandate have a difficult time containing Syrian insurgents bent on governing themselves . The comparisons to " Casablanca " are unavoidable , but at least in that film , one has a general sense of history and can lay a finger on the Nazi villain . In " Sirocco " , it's difficult to empathize with either side in the conflict as neither is particularly sympathetic or likable ; perhaps in hindsight that's one of the strengths of the film . Bogey's character is a gun runner with a checkered past and without hint of morals or principles . While Rick Blaine might have been a ' citizen of the world ' , Harry Smith's political convictions don't carry him that far - he's up for the highest bidder . As such , he's not very sympathetic or likable either , receiving a back handed compliment from Toren's Violette - " How can a man so ugly be so handsome " . It would have worked the other way around too . Dingy underground catacombs give the movie a claustrophobic feel as Harry takes it on the lam following a grenade bombing in a café . Violette invites herself along to Cairo , and the way Smith caved in to her request seemed a stretch , it was like no , you can't go , you can't go . . . oh , alright let's go . The lack of urgency and any remote chemistry between the two wasn't convincing enough for this viewer to have her along for the ride . In any event , you won't think of dried apricots in the same way again . If the film's ending was meant to capture a particular poignancy , it's meaning was lost on me . Smith's demise seemed senseless and unnecessary , and then the story ends in a heartbeat . The fate of Violette is a loose end which just adds to the unsatisfying conclusion . " Sirocco " could have been much more and certainly had a cast capable of pulling it off , but putting a checkered bow-tie on Bogey was just asking for trouble .
368231	2707735	50625	7.0	" You sure must like a bad gamble . "	It didn't take too long into the picture to realize that I had seen it before , the first time being 1963's " Gunfight At Comanche Creek " starring Audie Murphy in the George Montgomery role . In checking the film credits , it surprised me to learn that different writers are listed for each film , even though ' Gunfight ' is a virtual scene for scene re-creation of the original picture ; both were released by Allied Artists . The 1963 film scores a bit higher by IMDb voters , and I'll tell you why - Murphy in the lead role , and ' Bones ' McCoy himself , DeForest Kelley in the lead villain role as the outlaw gang leader . Not to say that Montgomery wasn't just as effective in his role as the undercover agency plant , but Murphy was the war hero . On the plus side for the earlier version , at least for me , was James Best as the conflicted outlaw who befriends Montgomery's character . There's really no point in going into any more detail here , my review of " Gunfight At Comanche Creek " pretty much tells the story . I did get a kick though out of the sign outside the barber shop in ' Badmen ' - " Up To Date System - Hot Towel " - who could pass up a come on like that ! Otherwise , depending on which film you might have seen first , you'll know what's coming in the second . At least Reed Hadley was credited for the voice over narration in ' Comanche Creek ' , incessant as it was , and totally unnecessary to follow the story .
367778	2707735	41929	7.0	" To the Rangers ! "	A reasonable enough entry to be included as part of AMC's Saturday morning Western lineup , the film brings together the somewhat unlikely trio of William Holden , Macdonald Carey and William Bendix in a tale of villains and Texas Rangers . The boys start out as amiable bad guys who get separated following one of their adventures , with Jim Dawkins ( Holden ) and Wahoo Jones ( Bendix ) eventually joining the Rangers , while their amigo Lorn ( Carey ) schemes to replace Charley Calico ( Alfonso Bedoya ) as the main desperado in the vicinity of Laredo . As formulaic as Westerns can be , I can't say that I've seen another quite like it before , especially when Lorn Reming does a Han Solo like bushwhack on his former ally Wahoo later in the picture . Even though Wahoo was planning to turn in his ex-buddy , the vicious turn of Carey's character was a sit up and take notice moment . The story offers a few other novelties as well . Alfonso Bedoya gets a bit more screen time here than he did as ' Gold Hat ' in " The Treasure of the Sierra Madre " , though he'll never have as great a line as the one about those ' steenking badges ' from that movie . I was really caught off guard to see Ray Teal as Calico's henchman Cantrel , virtually any time you see him in a Western he's playing a sheriff . I don't want to forget mentioning Mona Freeman as the story's romantic interest , first intrigued with Lorn Reming , and then when his true nature reveals itself , casting an eye for Jim Dawkins . Because the story spans a couple of years , her character Rannie Carter advances from a cute teenage cowgirl to a mature frontier woman . Bendix ' character had a great line when they first met - " You're mighty pretty if you're a her " . Though the Texas Rangers as an entity are part of the story , the film doesn't necessarily rely on that connection to work . However it does offer a convenient way for Jim and Wahoo to go straight while their partnership with Lorn falls apart . Of course the ending does submit to a fairly standard formula , but perhaps not in the manner in which it's carried out . For that though , you'll have to keep your eyes peeled for your local cable listings , as I'm unaware of the movie's availability elsewhere .
367782	2707735	47673	7.0	" I don't know what he's up to , but he's got that Rogers and Hammerstein look again " .	Often , repeat viewings of a movie will reward me with a greater appreciation for it , however in the case of " White Christmas " , the effect may be the opposite , so I might better ' count my blessings ' and stop with today's screening . Don't get me wrong , I'm all for nostalgia , but this one appears to have aged rather poorly , perhaps for no other reason than the passage of time and changing tastes . Probably the thing that works against the film the most is the choice of songs that have nothing to do with Christmas or the holiday season . Yes , there's the title song and repeated lines from ' Snow ' , but what's up with the ' Mandy ' dance number and the ' Choreography ' routine . Rosemary Clooney's Carousel Club song , " Love , You Done Me Wrong " seemed particularly troubling , even though it momentarily fit her situation with the Bingster . Also , another poster on this board had it right about " What Can You Do With A General " - I actually picked up the video sleeve to remind me what I was watching . Apart from the actual story , there's no reason not to admire the talent on display by the principals . To my mind , there's no finer singing voice than Bing Crosby's . Danny Kaye is spirited as Bing's partner , but he does tap that arm a bit much in the later going . Clooney's charm manages to come through her reserved character , but the showstopper if there is one would be Vera-Ellen in that ' Mandy ' routine , watching leaves one almost as breathless as she should have been while doing it . Except for the title and the packaging , " White Christmas " has no claim on the truly great holiday films like " It's A Wonderful Life " or the Alastair Sim " A Christmas Carol " . The only thing I WOULD like to know is if Emma ( Mary Wickes ) ever DID resign from ' Busybody's Anonymous ' .
368183	2707735	59076	7.0	" We're scientists , we have to do things we hate , that even sicken us . "	Even without the presence of Vincent Price , " Curse of the Fly " turns out to be quite the effective sci-fi horror thriller , and for me , a welcome treat courtesy of my local library , since I didn't know this third entry in the " Fly " series even existed until today . The picture effectively follows up on events of the original Price thriller , which I remember to this day as one of the all time great horror flicks to leave it's indelible impression on my youthful upbringing . Even if it doesn't have the audacity of ' Pleeeasee , help meee " , I thought the picture did a real fine job of spanning the generations utilizing the original teleporter gimmick . But gee , what's with the whole VE3TTF Montreal / G2FRR London business ? Did the Delambre's really have to go through all that protocol just to talk to each other ? It seemed pretty clever the first couple of times , but wore thin after awhile , and after all , who else would it be on the other end of the line ? But I guess that's part of what gives this flick it's unique character . What's really unique though was the way the picture opens . That was a head scratcher actually , I had to check the DVD sleeve to be sure I was watching the right movie . Escaping from the Fournier Mental Hospital ( nice set up ) , Pat Stanley traverses the Canadian countryside in her underwear until rescued , so to speak , by Martin Delambre ( George Baker ) on his way back home to Montreal . Now think about this - without ever questioning why she might have been traipsing around in her undies , the couple spends a week together before Martin pops the question . Not exactly the best recipe for a lasting marriage , but then again , there have probably been odder scenarios . The fact that you never even see a ' Fly ' in this movie shouldn't come as a let down ; the whole idea of the picture supports the premise of a Delambre legacy that resulted in tragedy the first time around , and continues to rear it's ugly head , or other mutations as the case may be . The creature effects are reasonably daring enough without going over the top , thereby helping to maintain suspense throughout . If I were rating the trio of pictures in the ' Fly ' series , I'd place this second to the original starring Vincent Price . Brian Donlevy is convincingly conflicted and creepy enough to take up the Delambre mantle as he tries to keep his sons in line with the scientific mission . Besides the principals , Burt Kwouk and Yvette Rees are convincing as the loyal Asian servants , but one has to wonder - Tai and Wan - Taiwan ? Who makes this stuff up ?
367952	2707735	33754	7.0	" Every time you open my mouth you get me in trouble . "	" In The Navy " is the second Abbott and Costello service film , with a nod to their first , " Buck Privates " in the opening credits . Genuinely high on patriotism , it brings back The Andrews Sisters and Shemp Howard from the prior picture . The plot involves crooner Russ Raymond ( Dick Powell ) dropping out of the celebrity spotlight , only to join the Navy under the name of Tom Halstead . He is relentlessly pursued by newspaper photographer Dorothy Roberts ( Claire Dodd ) , but gee , how many pictures did she need ? As Smoky Adams ( Abbott ) and Seaman Pomeroy Watson ( Costello ) , the boys are up to their usual antics which include Abbott's sleight of hand lemon routine , a money changing bit and a classic 7 times 13 equals 28 , and Costello can prove it three different ways ! In a slightly unsavory gag , the boys lay in wait for each other with mouths full of water ready to spray each other , but they keep breaking up and the sequence looks more like a series of outtakes that were left in the film . The Andrews Sisters are in usual fine form , with Patty much more animated in her lead role than in " Buck Privates " . They keep the film moving with songs from beginning to end , with a few well choreographed production numbers thrown in . The highlight of the film though belongs to Lou Costello , as he impersonates the Captain of the ship to impress the Andrews Sisters , and commandeers the ship in a series of naval routines , defying all the laws of physics along the way . With two service comedies under their belt , Bud and Lou would wind up in yet another branch of the service very quickly in 1941's " Keep ' Em Flying " , and with the war over , one final time in 1947's " Buck Privates Come Home " , reprising the original characters from their first Army film .
367965	2707735	22151	7.0	" A retired man hasn't any paradise . . . "	My first look at George Arliss as an actor and I must say that his was a strong and impressionable performance for someone who doesn't look like he could carry a movie . His character is James Alden , an automobile executive advised by his doctor to retire or face the consequences of a stressful lifestyle . Unable to find relief in the boredom of not working , he purchases a half interest in a gas station with a young aspiring architect . The story takes on a comic dimension as Alden conspires to hide his identity from partner Bill Merrick ( David Manners ) , who takes an interest in Alden's daughter Babs ( Evalyn Knapp ) , well before finding out who she really is . Though slow is spots , I was actually quite surprised with the writing and direction of this film , particularly in the fact that it's execution went well beyond the often seen elements from the silent era that many of the early 1930 movies exhibited . The one minor throwback to that period would be the wide eyed innocent look of Evalyn Knapp's character , but even there , her perkiness and style added a freshness to the picture . Not to mention that she and Merrick made a perfect match as a couple , but oh , that scene where they were parking in the moonlight ! I purchased the movie from a private collector because of James Cagney's name in the credits , and even though his presence can be measured in mere minutes , he takes over the screen the only time he's in sight . The same can be said for each of his prior film appearances , in which he exhibits all the flair he came to be known for in his most well known pictures and starring roles . Here he's an insurance salesman , with advice for Alden that goes against the doctor's grain . A great thing about period pieces , they sure take you back to a simpler time ; how about ten gallons of gas for $2 . 05 ! When the rival gas station owner ( Charley Grapewin ) lowers his price to fifteen cents a gallon , Alden's marketing acumen discourages potential customers from buying cheap gas ! Well of course the story goes full circle entirely , not only does Doc Harvey ( J . C . Nugent ) pronounce Alden healthy enough to go back to work , but his former executives ask him to return to the business to provide his wise counsel . Daughter Babs and partner Merrick get engaged , and the film closes on the traditional happy ending . It's all pretty predictable , but thinking about it , it might have been fairly novel back in 1931 . For early film buffs , take note of the 1930's assembly line near the start of the picture . There are a lot of neat looking vintage vehicles on display throughout , including roadsters casually mentioned costing ten and fifteen thousand dollars back in the day - Yikes !
368157	2707735	259324	7.0	" Raise no more devils than you can lay down ! "	You know how you can watch a super hero flick and be disappointed over how cheesy the hero's powers looked ? At least with " Ghost Rider " , you get the real deal . The CGI effects could not have been better to capture one's imagination of how the Marvel comic character should appear on the big screen . That goes for both the ' modern ' motorcycle riding Ghost Rider and the original Western hero created by writer Dick Ayers . As for the story , it's a somewhat clichéd premise that fortunately doesn't put the entire world at risk , only a small town known as San Venganza whose souls are held captive by the devil's contract and are fervently sought by the son of Mephistopheles . Through it all , you'll get some mileage out of a device known as the Penance Stare , and one liners that would do a comic book proud , like the Caretaker ( Sam Elliott ) to Johnny Blaze ( Nicolas Cage ) - " Congratulations , your chances just went from none to slim " . Apparently , Cage may have gotten in just under the wire as a super hero , as his age is starting to show . He actually takes his name from a Marvel second stringer called Luke Cage , but don't hold your breath for a movie about that character . His is an imposing task as the devil's bounty hunter , and he comes out on top using the old blood of the innocents trick to defeat his nemesis Blackheart ( Wes Bentley ) . But geez , didn't it seem like it was just a bit too easy ? For my money , Sam Elliott steals the show as Carter Slade , the first incarnation of the Ghost Rider , though it's never reconciled how he and Johnny co-exist together , but that's not too important . Watch this one with no more investment than a couple of hours to kill and an escapist mentality . With Eva Mendes on hand as the Rider's romantic interest , I kept humming one of Johnny Cash's trademark songs to myself as the story progressed - ' Love is a burning thing . . . '
367991	2707735	34248	7.0	" I'm honest because with you , I think , it's the best way to get results . "	Just about everything works with " Suspicion " , except of course the ending , not so much that it negates everything we've come to know about Johnnie Aysgarth ( Cary Grant ) , but in the way in which Lina ( Joan Fontaine ) simply takes it on faith that what Johnnie reveals is true . Johnnie the schemer , Johnnie the conniver , Johnnie the rogue ; ' yes dear , I was going to kill myself because I can't pay back my debts ' . Then they proceed to drive home to live happily ever after , except of course , nothing's changed . Johnnie still owes on his gambling debts and the embezzlement at Melbeck's , so how exactly is everything now hunky dory ? The explanation of course lies in the fact that Hitchcock's studio restrictions wouldn't allow him to portray Cary Grant as a murderer . It's too bad since having Grant play some of his scenes with an uncharacteristically dark edge revealed a side to his acting that wasn't often seen up till then . Contrast that with the sublime beauty of his new wife Lina ( Joan Fontaine ) , and you had the makings of a real thriller , but the ' huh ? ' ending we actually get made it less than satisfying for this viewer . Especially after ' murder ' in the scrabble tiles , ' Murder on the Footbridge ' and murder in the milk glass . Up until the ending though , I found the principals quite credible . Grant and Fontaine take their portrayals through convincing character arcs that build suspense along the way . I particularly enjoyed Nigel Bruce as Beaky ; as Dr . Watson in the Sherlock Holmes franchise he's much too restrained . Here he's affably jovial and offhandedly self effacing , as in the scene where he makes himself stand in the corner ; that almost took on the appearance of an ad lib and it worked wonderfully . Over the past year I've seen a number of Hitchcock's early British films , and one can note the progress in his story telling style . Now with back to back viewings of " Strangers On A Train " and " Suspicion " , it's apparent that not all of his American movies were an unqualified success . In a way that's O . K . , since it prepared him for his later masterpieces , notably " North by Northwest " and " Psycho " .
367825	2707735	60355	7.0	" Death comes soon enough , anyone who hurries it is a damn fool . "	" Duel At Diablo " had me thinking about Sidney Poitier's role , and I'd love to hear his reason for taking the assignment . Considering his appearance in one of my favorite films , " In The Heat Of The Night " , a classic study of racism and cultural fear , I wondered how he reconciled the role of a former black military officer helping the cavalry protect a supply wagon through Apache territory , with all the attendant characterizations of the red man as a hostile , savage brute . But Toller ( Poitier ) did have character , as demonstrated by the apology to Remsberg ( James Garner ) after learning of his wife's fate , that was an excellent scene . Dennis Weaver surprised me with his portrayal of Will Grange , showing a range of ability that far surpasses my singular impression of him as Matt Dillon's deputy , Chester Goode . He figures in somewhat of a story twist when it's revealed that he had a hand in the death of Remsberg's wife . The showdown you were expecting for the entire film managed to play out in a manner that kept Garner's character honorable , even if revenge was served . It was an effective way to handle the conflict . You know , I'm surprised that an obvious continuity issue hasn't been noted yet regarding the picture . When Remsberg leaves the soldiers for Fort Concho , he's riding a gray horse across the desert , but in the scene when the horse collapses from heat exhaustion , it's brown . A similar error occurs in the Western " Comanche Blanco " near the finale when William Shatner's horse changes color . It makes me wonder why film makers , or even the principal actor , can't remember how the scene started out so it can be finished without an obviously conflicting ending . They must have other things on their mind . At least it was gratifying to see that mathematical accountability came into play regarding the strength of both the Indian band and the cavalry . As the soldier forces dwindled , references were made to that effect , and you had a sense of the attrition . Contrast that with other Westerns where it often seems like one side or the other winds up with just as many men as they started with . You know , it wouldn't have taken much to turn this one into a John Ford / John Wayne cavalry Western . Most of the elements were there except the peaks of Monument Valley and a romantic interest for the leading man . Still , the inclusion of Ellen Grange ( Bibi Anderson ) as a conflicted white woman with an Apache baby added another layer of intensity to a film already chock full of angst driven characters . You knew she would make it to the end of the story , the question being , at what price .
368078	2707735	104299	7.0	" Is that a face that'll sell motor oil , or what ?	Usually these types of time travel stories wind up giving me a headache , but this one was pretty straightforward ( no pun intended ) . The protagonist , Alex Furlong ( Emilio Estevez ) is transported into the future . . . , and stays there . No attempt to get back to his former ' present time ' ; no fooling around with time lines that might affect the history of mankind . What made the picture interesting watching it today was that Alex was ' sent ' eighteen years into the future from 1991 to - 2009 ! That was sort of cool - but in the movie's 2009 , the country was already in the tenth year of a major depression instead of the first , like many today would have us believe . And it brought a chuckle to imagine if the ten million dollar bounty on Freejack Alex might have been offered by a company using bailout funds . Just thinking outside the movie box . I got a kick out of that scene in the bar when Alex is threatened by the marmaduke looking moron with his weapon , and Alex puts his on the counter with that sly Billy the Kid grin he used in " Young Guns " . The attraction back in the day of course was Mick Jagger headlining a theatrical release . His performance wasn't all that bad , even if over the top a few times , which the director might have actually called for . I liked that ' One Mississippi ' bit , and the idea that he had a sense of fair play in balancing his job with consideration for Furlong's catching him a break in the alley . The best concept though was the ' spiritual switchboard ' - don't you think we could all use one of those ?
368103	2707735	165905	7.0	" This town's on the wrong side of ugly . "	File this one under one of the better Westerns you probably never heard of . It pits a pair of good bad guys ( Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson ) , against a bad , bad guy in a tale of retribution and revenge that's full of clichés that play out refreshingly well when doled out by Lee Walker ( Nelson ) and Jesse Ray Tarence ( Kristofferson ) . It probably helps if you're a fan of the musicians , as the film offers a couple of well placed numbers to move it along ; Nelson's tune is particularly effective if you listen to the words carefully . The pair are joined by young Chad Willett , portraying the son of Waylon Jennings ' character Tobey , who's murdered in the film's opening scene to set up the story . Holden Bonney ( Sancho Gracia ) seeks vengeance on all three men for a perceived ill toward him ; he's the only one of their former gang who did prison time . All the others opted to join the Confederate Army in exchange for pardon upon completing their service . Failing to break their cohort out of jail , Holden has had years to stew about how to get even . What's not made clear is Holden's alliance with a Mexican colonel ( Simon Andru ) , who he hires to help take out his former partners . It's pretty transparent that the two are not very fond of each other , and it seems a bit overdone for him to need an entire Mexican Army regiment to do a Butch and Sundance on the boys . Waylon Jennings offers the film's narration after his brief appearance , in a diary given to his adopted son Brice by Lee . Brice reads the diary during his ride with the former outlaws , and gains new perspective on their life and the code they live by . One confusing element though , Brice's claim to fame was as " intecollegiate heavyweight boxing champ " - in the 1870's ? ? ? You just know he'll come to regret that claim , especially after he falls asleep during his first night watch and the group is robbed . He loses his title rather quickly to Tarence . Brice never learned how to handle a gun , his college training taught him how to be a farmer . So it comes as a surprise when he shoots Holden's gun out of his hand in the final showdown . Backing off , Holden uses a hidden derringer at close range to put down his young opponent . As Holden approaches at arm's length , Brice uses a Bowie knife that Tarence gave him earlier acknowledging his lack of skill with a firearm . As the Mexican soldiers are waved off by their leader , Brice collects his " business associates " , and heads into sundown with time to ponder on just who these men are that once rode with his father .
367898	2707735	79100	7.0	" I'm nobody's story but my own . "	So many movies got by me in the Seventies and Eighties that it's an occasional treat to catch one now that delivers in an entertaining fashion . I've never been a fan of Jane Fonda because of her politics , but there's not a scene here in which she doesn't look great , and not a scene where Robert Redford doesn't look like , . . . the Sundance Kid . He brings the same facial mannerisms and reactions to bear here as in his more acclaimed role , which by the way happens to be one of my all time favorite films . I guess teaming him up with a horse is just the right trick . The story has some of the elements that show up in my favorite movies as well , that of an underdog taking on a mission that's somehow larger than himself . By riding Silver Star off of a Las Vegas night club stage and into the Western wilderness , Sonny Steele is at the same time attempting to find personal redemption from a life overcome by glitz and crass commercialism . In the process , Fonda's character falls victim to a journalist's primary obstacle , that of becoming part of the story she's covering as a reporter . I recall seeing trailers for the film back when it first came out ; who can forget the image of the Electric Horseman as Redford mounts up on Silver Star and takes on the appearance of a Christmas tree on the Las Vegas strip . The story behind the picture still has relevance today , even more so than back in the Seventies , as each successive year's technology and focus on celebrity removes us further and further away from the things that matter most . Oddly , watching the picture today , it felt more like a made for TV movie than a major theatrical release . Another example of how each new blockbuster film today has to try and outdo the one before with even more elaborate glamor and special effects .
368592	2707735	38284	7.0	" It's not this town you're fightin ' for , it's the right to live . "	In the expansive history of film Westerns , the theme of cattle men against homesteaders has been done countless times , and " Abilene Town " turns out to be one of the better explorations of that subject . Interestingly , it also throws in a third element , that of the general merchandise shop keeper who stands to benefit from making the right choice between the two . Straddling atop that shaky fence is town marshal Dan Mitchell ( Randolph Scott ) , who has the vision to understand that what happens in Abilene , Kansas will have an impact across all the western territories sooner or later . The story takes place in 1870 , and most of the action occurs along Texas Street , where the best bar in town is called ' The Best Bar in Town ' , right alongside ' Joe's Texas Bar " and the simply named ' Saloon ' . A trail hand wonders what kind of town Abilene is with no bars on the other side of the street . When homesteaders begin to make their presence in town felt , Mitchell must perform a delicate balancing act between the opposing forces , and between two lovely young women . Ann Dvorak is saloon singer Rita , who literally keeps Mitchell hopping with precision kicks in the shin . Sherry Balder ( Rhonda Fleming ) is the daughter of the main shop keeper in town , who pines for Mitchell , until homesteader Henry Dreiser ( Lloyd Bridges ) wins her over with an appeal to her sense of family values and homesteader principles of working hard and building a life . Rounding out the main cast is Edgar Buchanan , a perennial favorite as County Marshal Bravo Trimble . Bravo has a unique nose for danger , and a compass that always points him in the opposite direction . He also has a penchant for a card game called ' fantan ' which he would rather play than do anything else , and Big Annie ( Helen Boyce ) is always willing to oblige . The film has it's fair share of saloon fights and gun play , though it gets a little disjointed during the cattle stampede that Cap Ryker's ( Dick Curtis ) men initiate to take down the barb wire barrier put up on the range land . Banding together , the homesteaders find the resolve they need to stand up to the raucous cattle drovers . In an ironic twist , Sheriff Mitchell allows the carousing bad boys to tear the saloons apart . His ' way a rough street dies ' speech near the end of the story is a fitting capstone to a turn of events that heralds the advance of civilization to a wild frontier . While in the background , shop keeper Balder does the math . With Randolph Scott in the starring role , I should have thought to count the number of outfit changes he'll go through before he tames Abilene . It's a signature mark of his Western films , and he doesn't disappoint here , though for my money , I prefer him in all black . With the town cleaned up and ready to move forward , the men and ladies pair off neatly , Mitchell and saloon girl Rita , Dreiser with Sherry Balder , and would be mayor Bravo with Big Annie . Somehow I got the feeling that they all had a different definition of ' fantan ' on their minds .
367570	2707735	31398	7.0	" How can we get a nice little war going ? "	I won't deny the film's epic status , but unfortunately the movie doesn't do it for me . Ultimately the title character doesn't seem as central to the story as one expects him to be , and instead it feels like the grand misadventures of the three principal characters ( McLaglen , Grant and Fairbanks Jr . ) . Individually and in concert , the trio wind up in scrapes they shouldn't have been expected to walk away from , and often have a grand old time doing so . The early action scenes in particular have an up tempo speeded up effect that looks appropriate in a Stooges or Abbott and Costello comedy , but given the sober circumstances , looks strangely out of place here . Where the humor does work , it usually involves Cary Grant's character Cutter - his fisticuff posture against McLaglen's Sgt . MacChesney was simply hilarious . Their team up over the elephant tonic punch bowl was also inspired , a neat comedic touch to let us know the entire story wasn't so grim . The scenes with the Thugee Guru ( Eduardo Ciannelli ) on the other hand jolt the viewer back to a different reality with his ' kill for the love of killing ' philosophy , inspired by the blood goddess Kali . What follows though gets incredibly murky , as Cutter gets lashed , shot and stabbed only to come back good as new . While Guru methodically outlines his master plan to destroy the British Army , his forces are rather easily defeated in an almost one sided battle . The water bearer Gunga Din ( Sam Jaffe ) earns a celebrated posthumous honor , and even though he died valiantly , one might wonder if his action was as important to the outcome as it was portrayed ; with Indian reinforcements the British victory didn't seem to be in much doubt . In an odd coincidence , I wound up finding this film in a thrift shop along with another era movie , " The Lives of a Bengal Lancer " . Both offer action and adventure on the Indian sub continent and feature talented casts . " Gunga Din " maintains a slight edge in popularity among viewers on this site at the time of this posting , though for it's epic sweep and better staged battle scenes , I give a slight nod to ' Lancer ' .
368514	2707735	31060	7.0	" Have you got a pencil , I left my typewriter in my other pants . "	Future viewers of " At The Circus " be warned - " Lydia , Oh Lydia ( The Tattooed Lady ) " is one of those tunes that stays with you long after the movie is over . It happened the first time I watched this film , and it's happening right now as I write this review . That's not necessarily a bad thing , provided you don't drive your family crazy with the lyrics over and over again . That's one of the bright spots of this Marx Brothers escapade , in a film that spotlights a ten thousand dollar circus heist , an inverted ceiling walker / aerial trapeze artist ( Eve Arden ) , and a club wielding gorilla named Gibraltar . Put all those elements together and you have an amusing and entertaining little number , though not generally credited as one of the Marx Brothers finest . Perennial wealthy Groucho patron Margaret Dumont makes her appearance rather late in this movie , befuddled as usual about attorney J . Cheever Loophole's intentions , which are actually commendable - he's attempting to negotiate a ten thousand dollar payday to save the Wilson Wonder Circus from the clutches of evil financier Carter ( James Burke ) . Earlier , owner Jeff Wilson ( Kenny Baker ) fell victim to Carter's strong arm and henchman Goliath ( an unrecognizable Nat Pendleton ) , who in concert with circus midget Little Professor Atom ( Jerry Maren ) , stole the money that would have given Wilson clear ownership . The clichéd theme is rounded out by Wilson's romantic interest Julie Randall ( Florence Rice ) , who probably should have been given more to do than just look pretty . The movie boasts a rather involved musical number featuring Harpo and a large , young black cast before settling into a standard harp routine . In an amusing sketch , Chico's character Antonio Perelli continually frustrates Groucho's attempt to interrogate the little professor about the stolen money . Later , Chico and Harpo team up to wreak havoc in Goliath's stateroom ; the feathers fly ( literally ) as they try to find the missing stash . Goliath by the way , bears such a striking resemblance to Harpo , that more could probably have been done to capitalize on the similarity . As in " The Big Store " , the movie spirals out of control with a rousing trapeze number featuring the boys , Peerless Pauline and Gibraltar the gorilla . It's vintage Marx Brothers , so swing your way to a good time !
368130	2707735	42324	7.0	" OK Coach , where's the field and who do we play ? "	With some minor plot revisions , " Chain Lightning " would just about qualify as a remake of Humphrey Bogart's 1936 film , " China Clipper " . In both stories , Bogey's character is a former military pilot who takes on a civilian job as a test pilot for demanding bosses . Raymond Massey portrays the owner of the Willis Aircraft Company , a role performed in the earlier film by Pat O'Brien . Both men are hard driving , ruthless individuals who put work and success above having a personal life , whose ambition test the people around them , including the Bogey character . The minor difference might be in the romantic interest for Bogart ; in ' Clipper ' there was none , here he's on again , off again with Jo Holloway ( Eleanor Parker ) in a romance that tests one's patience throughout the film . I don't know when the device was first used , but in this movie , the opening scene serves as the introduction to a flashback narrative that winds up back at the same point later in the film . The bookends are fairly successful in delivering a complete story , but left this viewer wondering how much of it was based in fact . A reference was made to breaking the sound barrier by Chuck Yeager's earlier 1946 flight , and it seems that the story builds on technological advances in the history of military flight building up to the invention of the ejector pod . Bogey's conflicted character is in it for the money right up to the point he hears his buddy's voice recorder message detailing how he lost his life in a failed test of a ' JA-4 ' experimental craft . Will he or won't he ? If it means hurtling back to Earth to be with his one true love Jo , all systems say go . I must say , I was a bit dismayed by Colonel Matt Brennan's ( Bogart ) post war job prospects . He's shown running his own flight school and charging customers three dollars an hour for the privilege . When a novice crash lands his only plane , it's time to look for more meaningful possibilities . What he's offered at Massey's company turns out to be seven hundred fifty dollars per MONTH ! The good old days swung both ways . Humphrey Bogart and Raymond Massey worked together once before in the 1943 war adventure " Action in the North Atlantic " . Interestingly , Bogey was top billed in both films , while Massey's character was his boss in both . Sometimes things just work out that way . As mentioned earlier , the film doesn't elaborate on events portrayed when it comes to accuracy . Obviously the ejector pod was someone's good idea at some point in time , but the way it's presented here would have meant more in a historical context . Even so , this viewer was kept interested enough by events in the film , even if the romantic angle between the principals seemed forced . Perhaps the film makers couldn't decide between Bogey landing his girl the easy way or the hard way .
367584	2707735	413300	7.0	" You know , I guess one person CAN make a difference . . . "	Unlike the first two Spider-Man films which I saw in theaters when they first came out , I sat this one out until last night to catch it on one of the cable channels . That decision was probably justified , as this one didn't feel like it had the heart of it's predecessors . Too many characters , too many sub-plots , too much of the angst ridden Peter Parker to take the joy out of the Spidey character . Growing up I wasn't much of a Marvel Comics fan , but you could tell that the film makers doing Marvel really had it together with their characters and writing . Even this one was pretty slick with the action and the special effects , but on the flip side , those elements might have been a negative as well - just a little too much and too over the top to produce any feeling of identification with the hero or his significant other . Not to mention the trillion to one ( notice how economic stimulus has affected my thinking ) coincidence of some outer space meteor depositing a tar-like symbiote right in Peter Parker's back yard , and not affecting any one else . You needed it for the story , but you just can't think about it for too long . My favorite part , as always , catching the creator of Spider-Man in his expected cameo appearance - the great Stan Lee - uttering my summary line above . He went on to finish the sentence with the trademark Marvel zombie catch phrase - ' nuff said ' . This will be the only time you'll hear it from me .
368386	2707735	114622	7.0	" Nobody dies till I tell ' em to die . "	I've probably seen James Caan more often as a villain than a hero , and the villain role suits him just fine . He goes from bad to evil to maniacal in the course of the story here , with a twist in the picture that comes out of nowhere that attempts to explain his hatred of the half breed Hudson Santeek ( Christopher Lambert ) . That he's a half breed himself serves no purpose other than to cause this viewer to go " Oh ! " , so I don't know why that element was even introduced . While watching the film , I hearkened back to my childhood days with ' Sergeant Preston Of The Yukon ' ; this could have been an extended episode of that show . Great footage of Alaskan sled dogs mushing through wind whipped snowy trails , not quite figuring out how competing sled teams didn't get all tangled up with each other . One thing Preston never had to put up with was getting shot and falling into icy rivers . Man , I can't imagine even being THAT cold ! I wonder if the actors got bonus pay for that . I caught this on the Encore Western Channel this evening , and I suppose the ' Western ' connotation has some bearing , even if filmed as an Alaskan wilderness adventure . It's got a typically ' B ' Western flavor focusing on an evil town boss ( Caan ) swindling local miners out of their gold claims and leaving them dead in his wake . I can't think of a Western that ever got the body / deed count as high as eleven like this picture did , which can only mean that Christopher Lambert was no Red Ryder or Durango Kid . For his trouble , the man should pour himself a brandy to warm up .
368456	2707735	41959	8.0	" I don't want another murder in this case , and you were born to be murdered . . . "	Had I gone into the film cold , I would have thought it came from Hitchcock , employing elements from that director's bag of cinematic tricks . You've got the spiral staircase motif initially seen way back in 1929's " Blackmail " and later given more profound treatment in 1958's " Vertigo " . There's also the amusement park background that provided suspense in the latter part of " Strangers On A Train " . But the thing that really appealed to me was the insertion of a key Hitchcockian element suggested by the movie's title . The ' third man ' upon reflection seems to be one of the all time great maguffins of cinema history . In all actuality , there never really was a ' third man ' , unless one considers Harry Lime to be that character . For that though , he would have had to be at his own ' death ' as the unknown individual who helped two other men remove a hit and run victim from the middle of a road . Which upon reflection , makes the core premise of the story very confusing . Not that Harry Lime wouldn't have wanted to fake his own death , but why didn't anyone who attended his funeral realize that it wasn't Harry in the coffin ? The real victim wasn't in a very good position to hide his identity , so how did the appearance of Harry Lime's burial come to be accepted as fact ? And why was that body so easily identifiable upon exhumation as the medical orderly Joseph Harbin who worked for Harry in the illicit penicillin trade ? If you really think about these issues , most of the story seems to unravel regarding the main plot . Yet the story works on an entirely different level once you get beyond that particular point . Harry Lime winds up alive halfway through the picture , and spends the rest of his time trying to stay a step ahead of his friend Holly Martins ( Joseph Cotten ) , who's intent on solving the mystery behind Harry's ' death ' . What makes the film so intriguing is the deft camera work and the battered post-war setting of Vienna , Austria . The picture simply wouldn't work in color , it's the stark black and white cinematography that contributes to the harrowing cat and mouse game between Harry , Martins and the authorities . You really have to study Orson Welles ' performance in the picture to see just what a great actor he was . He doesn't have a lot of screen time here , but everything he does is memorable , right from that first haunting appearance under the street lamp . His conversation with Martins on the ferris wheel is perfectly nuanced and laced with palpable threat ; it's just a perfect scene . You have to go well beyond the subtlety of his outward demeanor to realize what a true low life his character actually is .
367677	2707735	47720	8.0	" My name's Cheyenne Bodie . "	When " Cheyenne " debuted on / 1955 , " The Lone Ranger " had already been running for six seasons and had two more to go . Warner Brothers , specifically Jack Warner , tapped Clint Walker to be it's first TV Western hero , and raised the bar a considerable notch over the series made famous by Clayton Moore ( and John Hart for one season ) . Walker was a no nonsense but laid back hero , almost droll by comparison with ' B ' movie Western stars that preceded him , and that almost certainly added to his fame and popularity as Cheyenne . The Season I DVD compilation includes all fifteen episodes of the series ' first season . Series guest star James Garner appeared in three of them , as many as L . Q . Jones , who portrayed Cheyenne's map making sidekick Smitty in three of the first four shows . Garner's character was different each time out . Other notable guests in the first season included Myron Healey , Dennis Hopper , Barton MacLane , and even a young Michael Landon in an uncredited appearance . One of the interesting things about that first season is that two of the episodes were direct lifts of movies starring Humphrey Bogart . ' The Argonauts ' ( # 1 . 3 ) swipes scenes and dialog from " The Treasure of the Sierra Madre " in a similar story of greedy gold prospectors , but at least credits B . Traven as the author of the novel on which both were based . However ' Fury at Rio Hondo ' ( # 1 . 12 ) credits James Gunn with writing that story , but nowhere mentions Ernest Hemingway as the author of " To Have And Have Not " . Once again , the story's plot and characters parallel the Bogart film ; the Lauren Bacall role is handled by Peggie Castle , but she doesn't quite cut it as the sexy nineteen year old Bacall did in the original movie . For his part , Bodie was no Bogey . On that score , Clint Walker was competent as the laconic drifter Cheyenne Bodie , but like George Reeves in " The Adventures of Superman " TV series , he didn't have a lot to work with , and didn't rise much above the material , unless you consider his six and a half foot stature . Don't get me wrong , I like both Walker and " Cheyenne " and enjoy the shows , but if you consider the acting , the best you can say is that it was uneven . And the episodes , some were almost comical trying to be serious . Consider Episode # 1 . 11 , ' Quicksand ' , in which Cheyenne challenges a Comanche Chief in a battle to the death in a bed of muck . They start out standing upright , and slowly start to sink inch by inch until each proves the point that they would rather die than be proved a coward . Then , when the Comanche chief mounts his horse to ride away , he's no longer covered by mud ! As big as Walker was , it's interesting to see him cast opposite actors who came close to him in size ; Don Megowan comes to mind from Episode # 1 . 13 - ' Star in the Dust ' , as a sheriff who hires Cheyenne on as a deputy . That's one example , but it happened with some regularity . Kind of makes you wonder where all those big bad guys came from in the Old West . The Season I DVD set contains a nice ' Legacy of Cheyenne ' feature in which the seventy nine year old Walker talks about his early life and ' discovery ' by Van Johnson , who put him in touch with an agent . That contact eventually led to a role as a Sardinian Captain of the Guard in " The Ten Commandments " . Warner Brothers took an interest based on that role , and bought his contract from producer Hal Wallis with the Cheyenne role in mind . Originally , the show aired as part of an anthology series on the ABC network ; other posters on this board have done a nice job of outlining that history . My favorite show of the series - Episode # 7 . 1 , debuting the 1962 season , titled " The Durango Brothers " . Mama Hortense Durango ( Ellen Corby ) enlists her three renegade sons ( Jack Elam , Charlie Briggs , and Mickey Simpson ) to kidnap Cheyenne in order to marry him off to sister Lottie ( Sally Kellerman ! ! ! ) - it's hilarious ! Needless to say , Cheyenne finishes the show , the season and the series still single . " Cheyenne " began a great Western tradition at ABC , to be followed not only by that network , but CBS and NBC as well . Not many though , could ride as tall in the saddle as the original , and Clint Walker can rest easy knowing that there aren't many TV heroes that are admired as much as Cheyenne Bodie .

"	I'll have to admit that I tried reading Dee Brown's " Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee " on two separate occasions , the last time quite recently , and I found it to be VERY dry . Perhaps that was only in the early going , but I wasn't able to complete it both times . As for the film , I came across it quite by accident at my local library , not being an HBO subscriber . If I had my druthers , I guess I'd side with those reviewers who feel a more complete story could have been told using a mini-series format . However given the medium , it's a compelling film that highlights the plight of the Native American Indian in the dying days of the Old West , and with it , the death knell of a proud warrior people . I recently visited the James Fenimore Cooper Museum in Cooperstown , New York , and at the time , actual Sioux drawings were on exhibit depicting the Battle at Little Big Horn . Watching the aerial view of the attack on screen suddenly put into perspective the circular rendition of an artist's rendering on a full size tee-pee . It was like seeing a painting come to life with a soaring eagle's eye , perhaps devoid of detail , but breathtaking in it's panoramic perspective on the immensity of the battle . Not to mention the hopelessness of Custer's cause . The film can be absolutely depressing at times with it's depiction of outright slaughter , and perhaps even more so once the Sioux tribes are relegated to reservation life . We get to see how the ' Every Man a Chief ' designation , though sounding completely egalitarian , works to strip away a proud chief's identity and status within his nation . I'm actually glad that the film didn't explore Sitting Bull's Wild West Show days with Buffalo Bill . Fortunately , he was able to reaffirm his own dignity with the ' one last time ' confrontation against Senator Dawes ( Aidan Quinn ) , a legacy that remains standing to this day . Nice performances all around by Aidan Quinn as Senator Dawes , Adam Beach as the conflicted Ohiyesa / Charles Eastman , and August Schellenberg as Sitting Bull . President Grant came and went too quickly for me to recognize Fred Thompson under the beard , a trait he might also suffer as a Presidential contender unless he gets that fire in the belly .
367593	2707735	33226	8.0	" Too bad you and I had to be on opposite sides of the fence in this , I think we might have been friends . "	By December 1864 the Confederate Army was on it's last legs , literally and figuratively ; " Virginia City " explores a final attempt to finance the Southern cause via a bold plan by the Confederacy to smuggle five million dollars in gold from Virginia City , Nevada back to Richmond , Virginia . Captain Vance Irby ( Randolph Scott ) volunteers for the assignment , and pits his military skill and acumen against a resourceful Union Captain , Kerry Bradford ( Errol Flynn ) . The story opens with Irby foiling an escape attempt by Bradford and his men from Richmond's Libby Prison , alternatively known by it's guests as the Devil's Warehouse . Bradford lives for the day he can repay Irby for the indignity of foiling his plan , not to mention the months of tunneling in vain , as Irby was aware of the dig for just about as long . Along the way , an uncharacteristically miscast Humphrey Bogart makes his appearance as a Mexican bandit , with the un-Mexican name of John Murrell . He looks as uncomfortable here as he did opposing Jimmy Cagney's character in " The Oklahoma Kid " , Westerns were definitely not his forte . Though he did get a good line in on the stagecoach to Virginia City ; with a derringer trained on Bradford he states " I do not particularly want to shoot you mister , but I do not mind . " I tried to imagine him saying " We don't need no steenking badges " . Miriam Hopkins portrays Julia Hayne , the love interest for both lead antagonists , with Southern sympathies but an eye for a spy , that is , Captain Bradford . She spends a good deal of time agonizing over loyalties , while balancing her work life as a saloon singer in Virginia City . I must be pretty tone deaf , as I found her singing to be entertaining enough , unlike other posters for this film . On the other hand , it was supposed to be a cover , and a poll of drunken rowdy prospectors would score more for looks than voice anyway . I got a kick out of the ongoing banter between Bradford's pair of buddies , Marblehead ( Guinn " Big Boy " Williams ) and Moose ( Alan Hale ) . Their constant understated bickering lends just the right touch of comic relief to the film . There's a funny scene in the saloon as the boys begin drinking when they look to a picture of a semi clad woman above the bar ; one exclaims " I wonder what she'd do if we had another drink " . I didn't realize it until the closing credits , but young Cobby Gill was portrayed by Dickie Jones , who grew up to be the Range Rider's sidekick in the early 1950's series of the same name . For my money , Jones was the best stunt rider of them all , some of his work in that series is incredible . I was intrigued by some of the shooting styles offered in the film . In a couple of shootouts , Marblehead is shown " throwing " his gun in the direction of fire ; I can't see how that would be effective for accuracy . It was also the way Wild Bill Elliott used his six guns , at least in his Red Ryder movies . During the attack by Murrell's gang on the gold train , Bradford impresses Irby with his " wing fan " shooting . It was during this scene that a highly unusual , if not unbelievable development took place . After taking a life threatening bullet , Irby turns over his command to Bradford ! I'd like to see the rule book on that one . For all his military discipline , Bradford ultimately weighs in with his own conscience . Deliberately destroying the gold wagon to prevent it's capture by Murrell , Bradford is arrested and found guilty of high treason , sentenced to death by hanging on April 9 , 1865 - on the day General Lee is to surrender to Grant at Appomattox Court House . In a gallant and patriotic ending , excellent camera work captures President Lincoln's silhouette as he pardons Bradford , the anxious Miss Hayne having pleaded her case for the man she loves . It's as flag waving a moment as it gets , as Lincoln declares the South as not having lost , but having been found .
367917	2707735	41610	8.0	" I wouldn't know a gold mine if I fell into one . "	I rather enjoyed the description of the Superstition Mountain area of Arizona in the film's opening narrative as ' Satan's Private Art Gallery ' . The picture itself seemed to offer a preview of hell's future citizens with it's gripping story of the Lost Dutchman Mine , discovered by Jacob Walz in the 1880's at the end of a Sharp's rifle and a host of dead bodies . Though I don't know how much of the story's background is true historically , the legend of the Mexican Peralta brothers is displayed in a noirish flashback within a flashback . In it , the Apache Indians led by Cochise look like the most realistic tribe of Native American Indians I've ever seen portrayed in cinema , including I suppose " Dances With Wolves " . The cast is respectable and well suited for their roles , all appearing in the movie's main flashback story . Prospector Walz is portrayed by Glenn Ford , while Ida Lupino impresses as the gold digging ( no pun intended ) wife of Gig Young's character , in hiding from a murder rap back in Wisconsin . The locals of Florence Junction get a howl out of Pete's ( Young ) remark to Walz at the barber shop - " You can have my place " , Walz not yet realizing what the town gossipers have been guffawing about . In all of these period pieces I get a kick out of reminders of an earlier , simpler time - how about the sign in Julia's ( Lupino ) bakery shop - 10 cents a dozen for doughnuts ! Besides the main characters , it's also cool to see Will Geer , Paul Ford and Jay Silverheels in supporting roles , with a feisty Edgar Buchanan shuffling cards in his hat looking for that elusive ace of spades . Stay sharp and you also might recognize Billy Gray as the ' cookie boy ' . As for Lupino , it seems I only ever see her playing roles with a dark side , as she did in team ups with my favorite actor Humphrey Bogart - 1940's " They Drive By Night " and 1941's " High Sierra " . In fact , with the mountainous terrain at the center of this picture , that might have been a good name for this flick as well . With it's gold fever theme , colorful cast of characters , and greed at every turn , this is a worthwhile follow up to the better known " The Treasure of the Sierra Madre " , released a year prior in 1948 . Not as strong as ' Sierra ' , it's still pretty much a sleeper hit for fans of this unique genre , a mix of Western and gritty film noir .
368567	2707735	32484	8.0	" . . . don't tune me out , hang on a while , this is a big story . . . "	What's interesting for me in watching " Foreign Correspondent " is trying to imagine how American audiences of the time might have felt while on the doorstep of World War II with Europe about to blow up . In this country for only a short time , director Hitchcock's set pieces recreate the cities of London and Amsterdam in a tale of spies and traitors operating under the guise of a Universal Peace Party . It's chairman Fisher ( Herbert Marshall ) orchestrates the kidnapping of Dutch partner Van Meer ( Albert Bassermann ) , who has committed the details of a secret peace agreement to memory . Clause 27 turns out to be a classic Hitchcock maguffin , a device planted in the story to rouse the interest of the viewer , though it's details are never revealed . In fact , it's not necessary to do so , because the film's sleight of hand diverts us to assassination attempts , a Dutch windmill hideout for the villains and a harrowing plane crash into the ocean before it's all over . The intrigue moves along nicely with Joel McCrae as Morning Globe reporter Johnny Jones , who finds himself in the thick of things in more ways than one . He gets lured into the espionage drama after he witnesses what looks like the assassination of ambassador Van Meer , though by this time he's also becoming romantically involved with Carol Fisher ( Laraine Day ) . She's the daughter of the mastermind behind the spy ring , but having grown up British , her loyalty is staunchly pro Brit and anti war . Hitch builds suspense in the film on any number of levels , and each time it works , even when he goes for an ' in your face ' moment like Rowley's ( Edmund Gwenn ) attempt to push Johnny from the top of the cathedral . You know instinctively that Jones / Haverstock can't be dead , yet you maintain ever the slightest doubt until you see him again in the very next scene . But for sheer terror , the scenes of the ocean plane crash survivors scrambling onto the wreckage is about the most surreal and insane piece of film making ever , made all the more terrifying if you think of yourself being there . Personally , I can't even imagine confronting a horror like that , much less hanging on long enough to survive . Though not remembered as one of Hitchcock's better known films , the movie was nominated for six Oscars in it's day , ironically pitted against Hitch's first American film " Rebecca " which won Best Picture in 1941 . Though it may seem somewhat dated today , one can still have a good time with the movie by glossing over the less believable elements and riding it out for the mystery and adventure .
368539	2707735	33717	8.0	" Brother when they hang that number one tag on you they shoot first and argue afterwards , I know . "	By 1941 , Humphrey Bogart had nearly a dozen gangster roles to his credit , but in " High Sierra " we get to see a criminal with a heart . That aspect of Roy Earle's ( Bogey ) nature is played out with the chance meeting of Pa Goodhue ( Henry Travers ) and his pretty niece Velma ( Joan Leslie ) . Though their age difference is plainly visible , Earle experiences a pang of feeling for Velma , even though she is handicapped with a clubfoot . The story within a story of Roy's white knight effort to cure Velma's malady and find a way out of his life of crime is eventually derailed , but not before the viewer gets a chance to observe a tough guy's soft side . But then there's his hard side . Fresh out of Mossmoor prison , Roy Earle wastes no time in hooking up with former gangster friend Big Mack ( Donald MacBride ) who had arranged his early release , and has already lined up Roy's next big payday . Roy will have to get heavy handed with two rookie sidekicks ( Arthur Kennedy , Alan Curtis ) , who between them are juggling a pretty " dime a dance " girl along for the ride . The would be moll is Marie Garson ( Ida Lupino ) , who with one look at Earle instinctively knows her two companions are in over their head . Roy tries to keep his distance from Marie , but when Velma makes it clear that she's marrying another man , Earle's romantic interest in Marie is driven up a notch . The film makes good use of Warner Brothers stock players . Barton MacLane is on hand as a rogue cop who's taken up with Earle's boss Big Mack . Henry Travers is put to good use in a role that serves as a warm up for that of Clarence the Angel in " It's A Wonderful Life " . Cornel Wilde and Jerome Cowan find themselves in limited roles , Wilde as the smarmy Mendoza who sets up the hotel heist , and then rats out Roy to the authorities . And let's not forget Old Pard , the friendly mutt with an attraction to people who wind up dead . Pard had a good acting coach , he was Bogey's real life pet dog Zero . The newspapers hang a ' Mad Dog ' tag on Roy following the botched hotel heist and Earle's shooting death of Jack Kranmer ( MacLane ) . Presumably seeing Marie off to safety , he finds himself on the run and seeking refuge in the shadow of Mt . Whitney . Reacting to a radio broadcast , Marie retraces her steps back to witness Roy's stand against the police , knowing that he'll never allow himself to be taken alive . However Earle's final defeat doesn't have the defiance of Cagney's in " White Heat " , no ' top of the world Ma ' challenge to incite the authorities . In the end , a big time hood falls in disgrace . By then , you get the feeling that Marie already knows the answer to her own question when she asks a reporter - " Mister , what does it mean when a man crashes out ? " You may be surprised as I was to learn that Ida Lupino was actually top billed over Humphrey Bogart in " High Sierra " ; I'd be curious as to the politics involved in that decision . Though her performance is very good , her actual screen time is considerably less than Bogey's . Lupino also excelled in another team up with Bogart , that of the vile and conniving wife who murdered her husband in " They Drive by Night " . Catch that one for her intense courtroom scene , it's a blast .
367594	2707735	29864	8.0	" In an occupation as full of chances as mine , no use in taking unnecessary ones . "	Dr . T . S . Clitterhouse ( Edward G . Robinson ) is a cultivated and distinguished Park Avenue doctor , with a respectable list of clients . He's also obsessed with the workings of the criminal mind , and begins a research project that will help advance the cause of science and the medical profession in understanding the scientific basis for criminal action . As the film opens , the good doctor has just committed his fourth robbery , all jewel heists , and is now about to ingratiate himself with a mob , hoping to gain further insight . I found " The Amazing Dr . Clitterhouse " to be a blast , owing largely to Robinson's understated , almost casual performance as a master criminal . His random choice of a gang to work with leads him to Jo Keller ( Claire Trevor ) , and a short list of Warner stock players , including Allen Jenkins , Slapsie Maxie Rosenbloom , and Ward Bond as members of the mob . He's generally well received by all , especially after making Lieutenant Johnson ( Robert Homans ) sweat it out in a routine interrogation . The one thorn in Clitterhouse's side is Rocks Valentine ( Humphrey Bogart ) , who doesn't take kindly to the doctor's high society manner and scientific method . The fact that Jo might be falling for the doc is also a factor , though there is no chemistry to speak of between Jo and Rocks , their relationship primarily focused on the next big heist . What might have begun as scientific research begins to look a lot like enjoyment for the doctor , so after robbing a fur vault Clitterhouse decides it's time to take a break . He doesn't find it so easy though , as Bogie's character traces his identity back to it's Park Avenue origins and attempts to blackmail him . However the doc's knowledge of drugs give him the upper hand , and slipping Rocks a paradol chloride cocktail is enough to take him out of the picture . The cat and mouse game that follows between Police Inspector Lane ( Donald Crisp ) and Clitterhouse is well conceived ; as the doc is about to be arrested , the chance arrival of his lawyer offers an intriguing exchange that offers him a legal way out . With surprising calm , Clitterhouse learns that he's a megalomaniac , and as mad as a hatter if he thought he could get away with murder . The courtroom scene that follows turns into a three ring circus as the jury finds that Clitterhouse must be insane . One thing that surprised me though , is there such a thing as a " State Lunacy Commission " ? There are enough elements of each for this movie to be considered both a comedy and a crime film , with about equal parts of both taking center stage . Robinson's role is uncharacteristic of his typical gangster performances , here he's a cool and sophisticated operator ; he doesn't really believe he's doing anything wrong in his quest to advance scientific and medical science . Presiding over the final court room scene having given way to utter chaos , Clitterhouse calmly surveys the madness and can only comment - " Amazing , really amazing . "
368262	2707735	26029	8.0	" For all you know I may murder a woman a week . "	Time spent earlier in developing his craft allows Alfred Hitchcock to achieve a masterful film in the story of " The 39 Steps " . Combining a deft use of suspense and humor , the movie keeps one constantly off balance with it's story of odds defying events intruding into the life of a common man . Well , at least a common man who can instantly turn on a dime and outwit armies of police and address a political meeting as well as if he had prepared . The film's protagonist goes by Hannay ( Robert Donat ) , and when he's " picked up " by a music hall patron ( Lucie Mannheim ) , she winds up in his apartment with a knife in her back . That he's now a target as well in a mystery with few clues , Hannay embarks on a mission to uncover a state secret as well as save his own neck . Prepare for the unexpected when Hannay makes his first acquaintance with the man with the missing fingertip . Not only is the film fast paced and tension filled , but it's fun and sexy as well . The scene at the inn with Hannay still handcuffed to Pamela ( Madeleine Carroll ) is particularly memorable , made all the more so by the willful removal of her stockings , and I'm not just talking about the heat from the fireplace . It sort of memorializes Hannay's earlier line when the pair were on the run across the Scottish moors - " There are twenty million women in this island and I've gotta be chained to you . " Besides the humor , other Hitchcockian devices are at work here . One I was impressed with was the reaction from the woman who discovers the dead body in Hannay's apartment dissolving into the scream of a train whistle . The director himself provides one of his signature appearances as well , but you'll have to be attentive . As if to provide a satisfactory nightcap to the raucous proceedings , the movie's finale takes place during " Crazy Month " at the London Palladium , where Mr . Memory ( Wylie Watson ) reprises his act from the start of the film . As if in a trance , Memory reveals the 39 Steps as an organization of spies collecting information on behalf of the Foreign Office . . . You'll do well to view some of Alfred Hitchcock's prior films to appreciate the quantum leap in visual storytelling on view in " The 39 Steps " . It's reputation as one of his best films is well deserved , and is a must for fans of the master of suspense .
368053	2707735	462322	8.0	" Tonight , is a special night . "	Relentlessly outrageous and always over the top , " Grindhouse " is not a film for the masses , but if you go in knowing what to expect , this is one blast of a thrill ride start to finish . As a tribute to the sexploitation films of the Seventies , the movie is wildly successful in recreating the drive in movie experience of that era , complete with scratchy picture , missing reels and tons of gratuitous anatomical shots , if you know what I mean . Gory and violent too , to the point of squeamish if you have a weak stomach , but even then , it's in an effort to outdo itself in scene after scene . Now for the life of me , I couldn't really tell you what " Planet Terror " was supposed to be about . It's got mini scenarios about a feuding husband / wife doctor duo , a reuniting of former lovers ( Rose McGowan and Freddy Rodriguez ) , and lots of zombies . Bruce Willis turns up , but I can't say if he was a good guy or a bad guy . Lots of zombies too . There's so much going on , and one gets so mesmerized by Rose McGowan's amputated leg replaced by a stick and a machine gun that your rational mind has a little trouble keeping up with the sensory overload . Not to mention the zombies . The " Death Proof " segment is a bit more straightforward , and the title makes a whole lot of sense when put in context by Kurt Russell's character , Stunt Man Mike . Russell is maniacally effective as the thrill seeking lady killer , and the car chase scene has to be one of the best put to film . I could have done a lot less with the diner scene which seemed endless and virtually pointless , my mind straying to the one in Tarantino's " Reservoir Dogs " , which worked a whole lot better for it's relationship to that story . Before I forget , Russell gets to ham it up with a real cheesy John Wayne impersonation in the early going , way before the Challenger ladies turn the tables on him . Up front and in between , we're treated to four movie trailers and that instantly recognizable ' Feature Presentation ' music that was a mainstay of theaters back in the day . You couldn't get me to a drive in to watch any of this stuff when it was in it's prime , but today , reliving my youth , this stuff is a blast . The film gets a lot of mileage out of it's caricature of an era gone by , and that's the point , so you'll either get it or not get it , depending on your perspective . Oh yeah , my favorite grindhouse title of all time - " Sex Cures The Crazy " - never saw it , but still remember the title after almost forty years . Imagine the impact if I HAD seen it ! Hey , if you need a recommendation to see the film , I'll let Rosario Dawson's t-shirt tell the story - ' Badass Cinema ' - that's all you need to know .
368512	2707735	102744	8.0	" You got one shot left in that shooter , make the most of it . "	Up till now I've avoided Tom Selleck's Westerns , and really with no good reason . I was genuinely surprised at the characterization he gave to Matthew Quigley , a transplanted Wyoming cowboy answering an ad for a job in Australia . But let me get this straight , his intended employer wanted him to KILL native aborigines . Not relocate them , scare them away , or find a way to civilize them into the nineteenth century . He wanted Quigley to KILL them ! Now it's not like land owner Marston ( Alan Rickman ) would ever need even a part of the entire desert landscape he owned that took more than a few days to ride across . Marston is simply an evil person who deserved his initial trouncing by Quigley , thus setting up the eventual final showdown . The early appearance by Crazy Cora ( Laura San Giacomo ) makes one wonder what her eventual role in the film might be , and it turns out to be a good one . Cora delights in calling Quigley ' Roy ' for no apparent reason , but her looniness just might have a purpose . That scene in the desert cave against the dingoes was scary enough to complement a decent horror flick , made all the more horrific by actually being believable . When the moonlight hits those canine eyes , the resultant reflection makes you jump with anticipation . In it's own way , perhaps the real star of the film is Quigley's lever action breech loading Sharps rifle . Now the experts can have their say , but here's what this layman's takeaway is . When Quigley first demonstrates his ability with the weapon , he mentions that it's range for accuracy is about three thousand feet . Always one to question numbers thrown around in any context , a quick mental calculation pegs that at a fair range OVER half a mile . Today while on a flat stretch of highway I fixed my gaze on a location I deemed to be about a half mile away , and believe me , if there was a wooden bucket on the side of the road I would never be able to see it . However with an open mind , I'm open to referrals and demonstrations . At least ' Quigley ' prompts me to seek out some of Selleck's other Western fare since his story here is suitably impressive for a ' spirit warrior ' . And wouldn't you know it , Laura San Giacomo would find steady work in a comedy TV sitcom almost a decade later in a show ironically titled " Just Shoot Me " .
367578	2707735	25878	8.0	" The murderer is right in this room , sitting at this table . . . , you may serve the fish . "	An eccentric inventor has disappeared and his mistress secretary has turned up dead , after admitting that she has taken fifty thousand dollars worth of bonds from his shop safe . Enter Nick and Nora Charles ( William Powell and Myrna Loy ) , newlyweds who get pulled into the case in between social gatherings and martinis - " A dry martini you always shake to waltzes " . This is the first entry in " The Thin Man " series , named for the gaunt and wiry inventor Clyde Wynant . All signs point to Wynant himself as the murderer , especially after two more victims turn up . But Nick Charles isn't buying it , there are too many suspects - Joe Morelli , a hood that Wynant catches in his secretary's apartment , Wynant's ex-wife Mimi ( Minna Gombell ) who's always asking for more money , her new husband Chris ( Cesar Romero ) , the suspicious Tanner , Wynant's bookkeeper , and Herbert MacCaulay , his lawyer . Seemingly uninterested in the case , Nick wryly digests the events that unfold following Wynant's disappearance , exchanging snappy banter with wife Nora . One is caught off guard when Nick actually slugs his wife to prevent her from catching a bullet from the gun of Morelli , who comes to the Charles apartment to plead his innocence . To catch the murderer , Nick invites all the suspects to a dinner party , where he methodically reveals what he knows , waiting for an opening for the real killer to expose himself . It's all delightfully done , and Nick doesn't miss a beat for a second . " The Thin Man " holds up exceedingly well for it's seventy plus years of age , and is a classic comedy / mystery achievement , showing up on many " best " lists . Do give it a try , and it may wind up on yours as well .
367888	2707735	416449	8.0	" Spartans , prepare for glory ! "	When writer Frank Miller was a mere five years old , his older brother took him to an opening day screening of " The 300 Spartans " . That event remained permanently etched in his mind , and allowed Miller the luxury of years of research into the customs , traditions , training , weaponry and military strategy of the ancient Greeks . In 1998 , his graphic novel was released as a series of books from Dark Horse Comics , with Lynn Varley supplying the painted visuals in a stunning work that garnered numerous awards , both for the material itself and the artists involved . It was with some trepidation that I went to see the movie , as the few TV commercial ads I saw made it look like an advanced video game . By then though , the positive reviews had been piling up , from professional and amateur critics alike . Not to worry , though the degree of CGI involved in the filming is extraordinary , the actors themselves are very real . They had each other to work with , along with the singular artistic vision of director Zack Snyder , who kept copies of the ' 300 ' comic series on the set and referred to them daily to maintain the integrity of Miller's original work . In that regard , one might characterize the current film as a movie about a book about a movie , based on a real historical event . Of course liberties are taken in the telling of the story , but for veracity , you have history books . This piece is offered as entertainment , an often times brutal ballet of flashing swords and grisly hand to hand combat . The action scenes are further enhanced by a technique of speeding up and slowing down that helps concentrate the viewers attention . Be prepared for blood , but not in the spraying and pooling style of slasher flicks , here it's chunky and messy , crimson and muddy as befits the somber locale of Thermopylae , the ancient ' hot gates ' . To be balanced , a drawback of the movie might be the often clichéd dialog , spoken by Spartan friend and foe alike . However I found the appearance of Persian King Xerxes to be a cinematic and artistic achievement , an androgynous marvel who commands his screen time like no other villain I can think of . This movie won't be everyone's idea of a good time , however action / adventure fans as well as followers of Frank Miller's work will be well pleased . It should certainly be seen on the big screen to take advantage of it's unique filming style , and to get a good glimpse of the next generation of movie making .
368337	2707735	31971	8.0	" If there's anything I don't like , it's driving a stagecoach through Apache country . "	John Wayne's first appearance on screen in " Stagecoach " is one of the great character introductions in film . It's as if he took the energy from all those Republic , Lone Star and Monogram Westerns and compacted them into one grand entrance that subliminally announced ' here's a brand new Hollywood star ' . John Ford's trust in his actor friend forged a new chapter in American movie-making , and with it , the birth of the modern Western . I was surprised by the amount of humor in the story without a traditional comic relief character . For sure , you had Andy Devine in a characteristic role , but other individuals took their turn as well , notably Thomas Mitchell in his Oscar winning turn as Doc Boone , and Donald Meek as the subdued alcohol salesman . Can you picture him as the father of five kids in the story ? The best concept though was the ' Ladies of the Law and Order League ' ; who came up with that one ? For all the times he's mentioned by name , the one character who never winds up being a part of the action is the ' Apache butcher ' Geronimo . Checking even the secondary uncredited cast , one can find no mention of an on screen appearance by the Chief . One of the impressive things about the story is the way virtually all of the stagecoach characters start out as caricatures , and wind up evolving into three dimensional people you wind up either caring about , or disliking enough to want to see them get what's coming to them . They wind up feeling the same way about each other too , perhaps the relationship between Lucy Mallory ( Louise Platt ) and Dallas ( Claire Trevor ) to be the most transforming on a personal level . Hey , did the Plummer's ever have a chance once the Ringo Kid hit town ? Luke draws an aces and eights hand and a black cat crosses the path of the brothers as they take to the streets of Lordsburg . Wisely , the saloon owner took down the mirror over the bar , or there might have been seven years bad luck on top of the shootout . If I had to come up with a single odds defying moment that didn't work for me , it would have to be the ballistics ( is that the right word ? ) of the arrow that struck Peacock at the start of the Apache attack . It might have been possible if it had gone through the Doc's head first . On top of that , the booze salesman survived ! In fact , everyone on the stage survived , putting to shame the law of averages in a situation like that . One thing remained certain for John Wayne though , after dozens of Westerns , no matter what the situation , he winds up getting the girl . Unlike his many Lone Star films though , he actually had to work at it a bit , and vice versa for co-star Trevor . But at least it was neat the way Marshal Curly ( George Bancroft ) and the Doc gave Ringo and Dallas their send off , and it only cost the sheriff one drink !
368424	2707735	60196	8.0	" I'll dress , I'll kill ' em , I'll be right back . "	I guess I find myself somewhat in the middle on this film , I enjoyed it to a point , but I don't get the sense that this is one of the greatest Westerns ever , and the Western is my favorite movie genre . I much prefer a good psychological Western between complex antagonists , Eastwood's own " Unforgiven " would be an example . This was more a straightforward tale of three desperadoes consumed by greed who attempt to outwit each other on the trail to an unknown grave containing two hundred thousand dollars in gold coin . Each though , earns their respective title credit in the story , even if Eastwood's Blondie might be the ' good ' simply based on his classically rugged features . More on the plus side , it was really cool to hear the title theme music expressed in a handful of different ways throughout the story . The picture also captured the gritty realism of what the 1860's wild west was probably a lot like . You know , the more films I see of cowboys out in the desert days at a time with no access to soap and water , I start to wonder if they'll ever produce a picture that captures the fresh aroma of that experience . It's one thing to hear Tuco accused of smelling like a pig , but to actually get the full flavor of that would really be something . Then again , theater goers would never make it to the end of the picture - oh well for that idea . As for the film's length , I too side with those that feel it took a long time to get from Point A to Point B . I'm really wondering if it was necessary to bring in the Civil War battle for that bridge , but it did give rise to perhaps the most meaningful scene in the picture for me . Watching Blondie try to ease the soldier's death with his coat and a smoke was a masterful touch . You know , I could probably go so far as to put this film in the top twenty Westerns of all time , but it's position at # 4 in the IMDb top rankings of ALL pictures is just too much of a stretch . That's probably the reason I find myself going to that page less and less , and watching movies of all types more and more .
368497	2707735	16039	8.0	" Bring on the mastodons ! "	Having viewed " The Lost World " today for the first time , the predominant thing that struck me was the number of scenes that bore a similarity to ones in the original screen version of " King Kong " . However Kong was released almost eight years later in 1933 , which makes me curious as to how much an influence " The Lost World " might have been on one of my favorite movies of all time . For starters , you've got the principal character Professor Challenger ( Wallace Beery ) , who's convinced prehistoric dinosaurs exist in a section of the Amazon based on a notebook left behind by another adventurer , Maple White . White's daughter Paula ( Bessie Love ) survived an expedition there , though her father never returned . Challenger seeks funding to locate the missing White and prove that such creatures exist , but it would help if he wasn't such a nut . He goes completely berserk while making a presentation at the university when Edward Malone ( Lloyd Hughes ) reveals his identity as a newspaper reporter . Later he engages Malone in fisticuffs when the young man appears at his home to inquire about joining the expedition . Fortunately Malone has an agenda that appeals to Challenger , offering the financial backing of the London Record Journal in return for exclusive rights to the story . Other members of the Amazon bound group include Miss White , Sir John Roxton ( Lewis Stone ) , and Professor Summerlee ( Arthur Hoyt ) . Roxton fancies himself a love match for Miss Paula , but the age disparity makes that more than a long shot as the young lady's reaction suggests . The early stages of the trip offer a nice look at Amazonian wildlife , ranging from a jaguar and boa to a tree traveling sloth and a pair of adult spectacle bears that look more like cubs than the full grown animals they're said to be . Soon enough though upon arrival at the plateau where the original expedition traveled , dinosaurs make their appearance in quick succession . Heralded by a pterodactyl's appearance first , we're soon treated to brontosaurus , allosaurus and triceratops . For it's early use in movie history , the stop motion photography employed offers surprisingly adequate results . Considering that the film is eighty years old , it earns my appreciation for pioneering such a landmark technology . For me , the movie offers what I'm sure are some unintentionally funny moments . There's a scene when a brontosaurus prepares to do battle with an allosaur , and curls it's upper lip in a manner that would do Elvis Presley proud . Somewhat later , one of the camp orderlies throws a flaming branch at an allosaur making a night time raid , catching it in his mouth to resemble it's smoking a cigar . And is it just me , or did reporter Malone bear an uncanny resemblance to Charlie Sheen ? It's my understanding that versions of the movie exist in varying lengths ; the one I saw came in at just under an hour . As other posters have noted , there is a disjointed feel between scenes that cut quickly from expedition members to those of dinosaurs . My copy also offered an incessant upbeat piano soundtrack that didn't change tempo throughout the entire movie , somewhat disconcerting for those intervals of intense drama requiring a more somber or even a threatening tone . King Kong fans will sit up and take notice of some amazing similarities between the films . A log bridge connecting sections of the Amazon plateau is knocked down , this time by a brontosaurus . Later , when another bronto falls off a cliff into a mud pool , Professor Challenger has the bright idea of capturing it and bringing it back to London . Once there , the animal escapes to create havoc in the city as fleeing crowds run for their lives . Too big and bulky to climb anything resembling the Empire State Building , it does the next best thing by falling through and collapsing the Tower Bridge .
367763	2707735	38355	8.0	" My , my , my , such a lot of guns around town and so few brains . "	Starting out , I must advise that my review here is for the 1945 pre-release version of " The Big Sleep " , which had quite a few scenes redone prior to it's release to general audiences in October 1946 . With filming already completed by Spring of 1945 , there were two main reasons for the year and a half delay ; first , with World War II underway , Warner Brothers felt compelled to get it's war related films into theaters while they were still timely . Secondly , Producer / Director Howard Hawks was convinced he had to re-shoot some scenes involving Lauren Bacall , who was critically panned in her latest film , " Confidential Agent " with Charles Boyer . In the original print , Bacall is presented in a few scenes wearing a distracting veil , and it's her more glamorous side that the studio needed to capitalize on . Much has been made of the complexity of the " The Big Sleep " , and deservedly so . On my latest viewing , I took pen in hand to keep track of the characters and situations . That only helped so much . For example , Humprey Bogart's character , private detective Philip Marlowe is tailing rare book dealer Arthur Gwynne Geiger for his client General Sternwood ; Geiger allegedly holds gambling debts involving a few thousand dollars on Sternwood's daughter Carmen ( Martha Vickers ) . Following Geiger's auto to his residence , Marlowe studies his surroundings , and then hears a woman's scream and gunshots , followed immediately by two cars careening out of the driveway . Entering the house , he discovers the lifeless body of Geiger , and a spaced out Carmen Sternwood . Out of this scenario are offered two , maybe three possibilities . First , General Sternwood's chauffeur Owen Taylor is implicated , as he had fallen in love with Carmen and wanted to defend her from blackmail . Secondly , a shady Geiger accomplice Joe Brody may have done it , OR may have chased the guilty Taylor from the crime scene either to retrieve some incriminating blackmail film or to remove him as a potential witness . OR , the spaced out Carmen could have killed Geiger herself , and although this wasn't offered as a possibility in the film , she WAS present , and may have been entirely coherent when the murder was committed . And this is how the story proceeds . Even more characters are introduced to spin off the original plot , and Marlowe is off investigating the proprietor of a gambling house named Eddie Mars , Brody's accomplice Agnes Lozier , the salesgirl at the rare bookstore , and Harry Jones ( Elisha Cook Jr . ) , a tail on Marlowe who gets rubbed out after setting up a meeting with Agnes that might provide more information to go on . All of the intrigue aside , it's the chemistry once again between Bogey and by now , Mrs . Bogey , Lauren Bacall that propels this movie forward . Whether just sizing each other up at the beginning of the film , or as unwilling accomplices and possible lovers by film's end , it's the snappy banter and smoldering tension between the two that put the sizzle into this edgy noir thriller . As if to prove how great an actor Bogart was , this film offers us a glimpse at his incredible range . Of course I'm referring to the bookstore scene in which Bogey portrays a nerdy client seeking information on a non existent rare book . With a mere upturn of his hat's brim and a cleverly positioned pair of glasses , Bogart completely transforms into an almost unrecognizable comic character who befuddles and infuriates the store's proprietress . He follows that up with a walk across the street , and a double entendre filled conversation with a disarmingly seductive Dorothy Malone in a scene that could have lingered into X-rated territory if not for the task at hand . One could go on and on about " The Big Sleep " , and others have , but to appreciate the film's mystery , darkness and noir complexity you'll have to view it . But don't try to solve the case , you won't want to hurt yourself .
368561	2707735	61578	8.0	" Killing generals could get to be a habit with me . "	Wow , it's forty years since this film was made , and forty years since I last saw it . I've been revisiting some of the pictures I initially saw upon their original theatrical release in order to see how my impression of the movie might have changed over time . " The Dirty Dozen " still holds up as a strong war time drama , made most compelling for me by the way Major Reisman ( Lee Marvin ) reads each of his ' recruits ' in order to mold them into a cohesive unit . In fact it's the first third of the picture that I enjoy the most , as the major characters are introduced and we get to know just enough about each to understand how their motivations might be exploited . John Cassavetes ' portrayal of Victor Franko may have been the most complex on the surface , but Telly Savalas had an unusual assignment in the character of Archer Maggott . Although couched in religious extremism , I think the character went beyond that into a complex moral ambiguity . It was the kind of character that could have been the subject of a picture all by itself . The casting surprise , if you grew up in the 1960's , had to do with Trini Lopez as the soldier Jimenez . Until this picture , my only recollection of Lopez would be as a singer with some upbeat singles hits like " If I Had a Hammer " and " Lemon Tree " . I'm curious as to how he was selected for a part in this picture , since the other main characters were already fairly well established as actors ( Marvin , Savalas , Bronson , George Kennedy ) , or on the rise ( Donald Sutherland , Jim Brown ) . To his credit , Lopez did a fairly good job for the limited role he had . What I couldn't quite understand was why the Robert Ryan character , Colonel Breed , wound up at odds with Major Reisman and the Dozen . He was aware from the start that Reisman would be training his men in secrecy for a behind the lines mission , so it didn't seem logical to me that he would try to thwart it's progress . It was mentioned earlier that Reisman and Breed didn't see eye to eye based on a former association , but still , the new objective for which Reisman was training his men was for the good of the war effort . I've read with interest a number of the negative comments on the picture regarding the method of executing the mission via gasoline and explosives . I don't recall how that scenario was reviewed back in the late Sixties , but it seems we've come so far in terms of political correctness over the last forty years that there seems to be something to offend someone in every picture since , including cartoons . For my part , war is a dirty business where political correctness doesn't apply . Hitler didn't seem too concerned about incinerating women and children along with Jewish men as part of his ethnic cleansing program . If anything , the picture absolutely left out any hint of the savagery and brutality of Nazi officers , but I didn't read any complaints about that . Interesting . Also interesting is the point that the fictionalized events of the story were set BEFORE America's entry into the European Theater with the Allied D-Day landing at Normandy . It's easy to overlook that fact while the movie goes through it's paces , as the viewer's memory tends to recall events and battles of World War II that hadn't occurred yet relative to the story being told .
368319	2707735	31210	8.0	" Someday you'll learn that courage is in the blood . "	I can just picture theater patrons leaving this movie during it's original release , not a dry eye in the house ; an endearing testimony to the strength of Bette Davis ' portrayal of the young snooty socialite turned human over the course of the story . As Miss Judith Traherne , Davis exhibits a wide range of emotion in her role , helping establish her reputation as one of film's finest actresses . Along the way , Davis is supported by an unusually strong contingent of Warner contract players , most notably George Brent as the doctor turned husband , Frederick Steele . Established in a highly successful surgical career , Steele is continuously frustrated in his attempt to semi-retire to a life of research at his Vermont farm . Miss Judith is just his latest diversion , one that his professional reputation and personal responsibility will not allow to go without helping . During his association with Judith , he manages to fall in love , while creating the same intense and wonderful feelings in her . Where his nobility fails is in his attempt to keep Judith's true condition secret from her , in collaboration with Judith's best friend , Miss Ann ( Geraldine Fitzgerald ) . Fitzgerald's performance in it's own way is almost as touching as Davis ' own , as the loyal friend and confidante who must watch her best friend slowly fade toward an unhappy ending . Ronald Reagan appears a number of times throughout the film as a member of Davis ' social circle , and whether by design or not , he never appears sober . Henry Travers , the diligent wing earning angel from " It's a Wonderful Life " appears as Miss Judith's family physician in a subdued role . And to be completely honest , my original interest in this film was in completing my collection of Humphrey Bogart movies ; here he has minimal screen time as a horse trainer with an eye for Miss Judith who realizes that his station would never allow for such a match up . It's interesting to see Bogey near the end of the film in the obligatory trench coat for which he's well known . The film's ending is powerful and given added poignancy as Miss Judith plants a flower bulb after sending her husband off to an important medical gathering . With Judith's vision dimming , Miss Ann cannot contain her tears and is sent off by Miss Judith as well to remember happier times . As Judith stumbles up the stairs to her bedroom , the maid symbolically draws the curtain against the sunlight , while Judith says a final prayer , and it's over . Commence tears . To date , my viewing of Bette Davis films have been limited to her collaborations with Humphrey Bogart , but that's a total of six films , more than any other pairing with my favorite actor . Edward G . Robinson appeared with Bogey in five films , and one of them , " Kid Galahad " also featured Bette Davis , once again in a role showing many facets of her ability . Intrigued as I am with her performance in " Dark Victory " , I'll be looking forward to more of her films .
368463	2707735	54953	9.0	" Someone's got to take responsibility if the job's going to get done . "	Excellent action / adventure war film , even if fictional ; the set-up and follow through is generally believable and handled by a talented cast . I'm adding Gregory Peck to my list of favorite actors , having seen him now a number of times in " To Kill A Mockingbird " and as Johnny Ringo in " The Gunfighter " , along with a handful of other films . Peck's character , Captain Keith Mallory , becomes the nominal leader of a band of soldiers on a mission to take out a pair of radar controlled guns on a Greek island protecting access to the Aegean Sea . If they fail , two thousand British soldiers will die in a Nazi show of force intended to bring Turkey into the war on the side of the Axis Powers . This is the kind of movie made at a time when you just knew what the outcome would be , so the excitement had to be in the way you got to the finish line . The story here is a well crafted one , even if some elements defy credibility after the fact . Such as ' Butcher ' Brown's ( Stanley Baker ) reluctance to use fatal force to reckon with an enemy , thereby casting some doubt as to his nickname . Or the motivation of the traitor Anna ( Gia Scala ) once she reunited with her friend Maria ( Irene Pappas ) and fell in league with the Navarone team . Those issues were glossed over rather quickly if not very convincingly , but they weren't enough to defuse the intensity of the story . The best scenes had to do with one on one confrontations presenting a moral dilemma , like the early scene when Major Franklin ( Anthony Quayle ) faced down another officer over the fate of the laundry boy . Even better and more intense was the showdown over Anna between Mallory and Corporal Miller ( David Niven ) . The scene presented no other choice for Mallory than to do his duty , for which he was spared by the intervention of Maria Pappadimos , a clever twist inserted by the screenplay . The best ruse though had to do with Mallory's planting a false lead with the severely injured Franklin , a plot element virtually indispensable if the mission were to succeed . The other thing that kept one's interest aside from the Navarone mission was the unfinished business between Mallory and his former friend and ally Andrea Stavros ( Anthony Quinn ) . Again , one has a sense that they'll settle their score favorably , but it's always in the back of the viewer's mind as to how that scenario will play out . For a film that doesn't have to rely on lighter moments , I got a kick out of David Niven's mid film " Heil , everybody " ! But you have to admit , for all his misgivings about never learning to swim , he wasn't a very convincing drowner .
367559	2707735	53125	9.0	" Games , must we ? "	When you come right down to it , the title " North By Northwest " tells you nothing about the story , but it certainly rolls off the tongue a lot better than " The Man in Lincoln's Nose " as the movie was originally known . The official title comes from Hamlet - " I am but mad north-north-west " . Fortunately , a scene at the airline's ticket counter lends some semblance of credibility to the northwest connection . What had me going was how the film managed to keep up with the pretense of a phony George Kaplan , to the point where Cary Grant's character winds up becoming the impostor . Grant was a Hitchcock favorite , and the role here was written with him in mind , even though MGM wanted Gregory Peck in the lead . I don't know if Peck could have pulled off the auction scene the same way as Grant . His roles portraying slick hustlers like Walter Burns in " His Girl Friday " or the more sinister Johnnie Asgarth in another Hitchcock effort " Suspicion " , more than readied him to pull off the stunt and get away with it . Eve Kendall ( Eva Marie Saint ) is clearly a duplicitous character , one gets the impression that maybe Roger Thornhill ( Grant ) is just a bit too good for her . Hitch's penchant for beautiful blonds in his films gets the royal treatment here , Saint is radiant in nearly all her scenes , made more so by the bright red of her outfit on the train . You know , I could listen to James Mason speak all day , he's got that great resonant quality to his voice . Casting him as the villain lends immediate credibility to the bad guy cause in the story . Martin Landau appears in one of his first film roles as Mason's henchman . I always enjoy seeing Leo G . Carroll in a film , probably because of my fondness for his role in the early TV series " Topper " . Here he appears cast somewhat against type as The Professor heading up an unknown agency that attempts to take down Vandamm's ( Mason ) subversive little clique . It was actually a bit chilling to see The Professor willing to let the cards fall as they may as relating to Thornhill's dilemma . If done today , I'm sure the whole Mount Rushmore scene would be presented to look a lot more believable ; the way Thornhill prevails requires a stretch of the imagination . But by that time , I found myself saying ' who cares ' , because the thrill ride was worth it to see Grant come away the hero . Hitch pulls it off with that neat device at the end of the story so we don't get caught up in the whole cliff hanger ending ordeal . It's a clever little happy ending to an espionage tale that might have suffered in less capable hands , but here director Hitchcock keeps you on your toes and the edge of your seat in a way that delivers the goods .
368022	2707735	433383	10.0	" You know it occurs to me we might not get away with this one . "	If you were a kid growing up in the 1950's ( as I was ) , certain impressions remain with you to this day . I was only three years old during the months of depicted in this film , so I don't have first hand memory of Edward R . Murrow's broadcasts . However the paranoia of Communism remained for the remainder of the decade , and with it came the " duck and cover " air raid drills and canned food storage drives aimed at keeping children safe at their elementary or parochial schools . Imagine being a kid and wondering if the Commies might be sending their warplanes to America to drop bombs on us . Replace that fear today with the threat of international terrorism , and it appears that times haven't changed that much . " Good Night and Good Luck " plays as a unique microcosm of American life during the ' 50's . Smoke filled rooms and drinks after work were about as natural as breathing . David Strathairn gives an incredible performance as Murrow , made all the more remarkable for his virtual lack of emotion . I'm sure that at some time in his life the newsman must have cracked a smile , but you would never know it here . With dedication of purpose and carefully chosen words , Murrow's mission is to expose the truth , with courage and principle . Lately I've been getting a retro ' 50's fix of era TV Shows , movies , and commercials , and this movie supplies a well integrated blend of the politics , news and commercialism of the time . What it does best though is explore one man's battle against narrow mindedness . On that score , it's a classic real life story that can help us all learn how to agree to disagree .
368082	2707735	409459	10.0	" In my opinion , the existence of life is a highly overrated phenomenon . "	In anticipation of the movie , I read " Watchmen " just about a month ago , it was my fourth time . Each time , I came away with a greater understanding of the characters and story , in no small part due to the extensive narrative offered as backup to the panels one most closely associates with the comic book medium . To enjoy the movie , I don't think it's a prerequisite to read the book first , but I will say this - a viewer going in cold will have no idea that some of the scenes in the opening montage preface events in the story , like the young Laurie Jupiter watching her mother argue with her then husband ( who wasn't revealed by name in the movie version ) . I think having that insight only brings a greater satisfaction to the viewer who has an insider's understanding of where the story is going . What most impresses me with the film adaptation was director Zack Snyder's attention to detail , reminiscent of the same way he approached " 300 " , another graphic novel by veteran writer Frank Miller . Granted , the ending , which many devotees of Moore will find fault with , is somewhat different from the original , but I was left entirely satisfied with the way the movie handled it . So much so , that I was left wondering why Moore hadn't come up with a similar ending himself , it seemed to make a whole lot more sense given the attention to Dr . Manhattan's self imposed off planet exile . Even in the graphic novel version , the alien creature construct ( ' the squid ' ) , seemed clunky , perhaps more so in the artwork then in the concept . I say this after the fact of course ; upon an initial reading , the story flows quite logically in regard to Ozymandias ' scheme to defuse tension between the world powers . What truly amazed me about the movie was how the entire back story of the characters meshed perfectly with events happening now , with no disconnect to the chapters of the original graphic novel . That , and the virtually perfect casting of actors for the lead roles . The only character that I had some trouble with was Matthew Goode's portrayal of Adrian Veidt / Ozymandias , I was expecting someone a little older and perhaps a bit huskier in physique . But Billy Crudup , Jeffrey Dean Morgan , Patrick Wilson , and especially Jackie Earle Haley were perfect choices for their characters . Put Heath Ledger's Joker up against Haley's Rorschach and I think you'd be hard pressed to come up with a clear winner . The role of Laurie Jupiter could probably have been handled competently by any number of current young actresses , but with all said and done , Malin Akerman did just fine . As for the run time of nearly three hours , I might be in the minority on this , but I didn't have a problem with the length and pacing of the picture at all . In fact , I'm looking forward to the extended version when it eventually comes out on DVD . I don't understand why movie goers seem to have a problem with anything much over ninety minutes or so ; for my money , as long as the quality matches the content , more is always better by me . I mean after all , I'm going to a film to escape for a brief time from some of the lunacy going on in the world , so keeping me in my seat for an additional hour isn't the worst that could happen . With minor nods to the present , the " Watchmen " set in the mid 1980's doesn't seem like it would be much different from a fictional universe set in the present day . I'm thinking specifically about the notion of super power rivalry over finite resources and energy supply , and the ever elusive concept of a just and lasting peace between the major players on the world stage . In that regard , I'm reminded of a similar theme at the center of a movie that came out more than a half century ago . In " The Day The Earth Stood Still " ( 1951 ) , the Earth's major powers were faced with the threat of annihilation from an alien source if they persisted in continuing a rivalry that might lead to nuclear annihilation . The Ozymandias solution , for all it's intended ' good ' effort to sacrifice millions to save billions , in the end would never achieve success for the simple reason posited in the graphic novel by Dr . Manhattan , and in the movie by Laurie to Dreiberg in a closing scene - Nothing ends , nothing ever ends . . . " For all his effort , Adrian Veidt achieved only a temporary goal .
367734	2707735	52618	10.0	" How do you fight an idea , especially a new idea ? "	The word that kept coming to me throughout my viewing of " Ben-Hur " was ' grand ' ; the film has a wondrous feel of grandeur even in it's most serene moments . The vibrancy of it's color comes through gloriously , perhaps in part due to it's treatment on the four disc DVD special edition . It's a film that one can easily use to describe the term epic , the type of movie that comes out perhaps once in a decade . I'm particularly impressed with the way director William Wyler managed to intersperse defining moments of Christ's life in a way that did not detract from the character of Judah Ben-Hur ( Charlton Heston ) . Those include the Sermon on the Mount and the washing of Pilate's hands as the Judean governor turned Jesus over to the mob . In those instances , Ben-Hur is shown consumed by the urgency of his quest to oppose Roman authority . He is not a direct witness to Christ's mission , yet those pivotal moments come full circle when Ben-Hur realizes that the man to be crucified is one and the same who showed him a kindness as Judah was marched off , condemned to be a galley slave in a Roman war ship . The scene in the movie that everyone calls to mind obviously is the chariot race . Magnificently staged in an era bereft of the kind of digital effects available today , the segment withstands the passage of time for excitement and believability . What I found particularly intriguing was the incredible stunt work that had it's birth in the early days of the Western film genre , most notably in the work of Yakima Canutt . To my surprise , Canutt's name appeared in the credits as head of the second unit , along with his sons who took up their father's mantle in the business . The scenes of chariot drivers falling victim to their reckless abandon has the indelible stamp of Yakima Canutt all over it , owing in large part to stunt techniques he developed back in the 1930's . But back to the spiritual message . Judah Ben-Hur's ultimate victory does not involve hand to hand combat with an enemy , or leading a citizenry to revolt against a tyrannical Roman governor . It has all to do with the quiet power of Christ washing away the world's sins along with the disfiguring leprosy of Judah's mother and sister ; the same power that compels Ben-Hur to give up his sword , instead of wielding it for hateful revenge .
367571	2707735	338013	10.0	" Technically speaking , the procedure IS brain damage . "	After repeat viewings , it's still difficult to understand if this movie is brilliant or a director's simplistic mind game . Lately though , I'll side with the former . What the movie does is make you think , think about what's going on in the film , and maybe even what's going on in your own life . Because ultimately , we are our memories , and without them , we are merely shells . The disorienting camera angles during Joel Barish's ( Jim Carrey ) mind wipe procedure create an unsettling discomfort . Joel hears the voices of the technicians Stan ( Mark Ruffalo ) and Patrick ( Elijah Wood ) as Joel's breakup memory with Clementine ( Kate Winslet ) is being erased , and he furiously attempts to hang on and not let go . It's a torturous struggle as both the good and bad memories hold sway at different times . What Joel , Clementine , Stan , Patrick , Mary and Dr . Mierzwiak all seek are best expressed in Clementine's own words - " . . . you'll remember me in the morning , and you'll come to me , and you'll tell me about us , we'll start over " . Probably more than anything , " Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind " is about starting over . The futility and frustration of life and relationships are set aside when love conquers petty disappointments , and you have someone who understands you can turn to . Focus on the memories .
367597	2707735	24216	10.0	" It was beauty killed the beast . "	There are a handful of movies , my favorites , that I watch annually - the original " King Kong " is one of them . My timing this year is appropriately planned , the Peter Jackson remake is just a few weeks away . Generally , it's almost impossible to surpass the original of any title , but I'll keep an open mind . In the mean time , I'm still in awe of the cinematography , effects and story line of this 1933 classic . Right from the opening line - " Say , is this the moving picture ship ? " - you know something special is about to happen . Promoter Carl Denham ( Robert Armstrong ) is embarking on a fantastic voyage , and as the viewer tags along , all concerned are about to undergo a harrowing and exciting adventure . His discovery , Ann Darrow ( Fay Wray ) exudes a likable shyness along with her understated good looks , and if she has any reservations about Denham's offer to star in his movie , it's quickly replaced by the action , adventure and romance on the voyage to the mythical Skull Island . It's not on any of the navigation charts , but it's the perfect destination for Denham's recklessness and secrecy . " Did you ever hear of . . . Kong ? " Considering that the film was made over seventy years ago , I'm constantly amazed at the technical wizardry and attention to detail employed for what could have been just another monster movie . And make no mistake , this is the quintessential monster film . Once Kong makes his grand entrance to abduct the " golden woman " , a host of prehistoric beasts appear in rapid succession in grand stop motion photography . We're treated to a stegosaurus , brontosaurus , tyrannosaurus rex , a huge snake like lizard , and a pterodactyl , all supplying varying degrees of menace to Kong and humans alike . What's fascinating though , is the intricacy of the scenes , the predatory wagging of the T-Rex tail as he does battle with Kong , the flow of blood from the dead beast's head , the appearance of the scavenging prehistoric vulture feasting on the body . And it's not just the visual , the sound of the cracking jaw when King Kong defeats his enemy is raw and guttural , complementing a truly visceral confrontation . Kong's brief brush with the island natives after forcing his way through the wooden barricade is also remarkable for it's brutality . More than once , Kong is shown chomping on unlucky victims , while others are shown summarily trampled underfoot in the soft island mud . It's a fitting preview for the destruction in New York , where Kong's new enemies are photographers , trains and aerial dive bombers . Who can forget the pathos in the creature's face as he nurses his gunshot wounds , about to fall to his death from the Empire State Building ? The movie ends as it began , paying homage to an ancient Arabian proverb - " It was beauty killed the beast " . If you pay close attention , you'll be able to pick out the differences between the full body Kong and the separately constructed head and face used for close up shots . The full size Kong , an eighteen inch puppet , has a head that tapers more or less to an upward point , with a ridge line above the eyes . The closeup Kong's face is rounder and squatter , with those unmistakable canines ready to do business . " King Kong " would go on to create an entire genre of big ape movies , including it's own spin off , " The Son of Kong " , also featuring Robert Armstrong reprising his Denham character . Quite a few years later , Armstrong appeared in " Mighty Joe Young " , whose title character was a much more " normal " sized gorilla . The 1940's and 50's were ripe with " B " grade fare dealing with gorilla and ape themes , but by then it was usually a man in a monkey suit doing the honors . But they all owe it to the king of movie monsters - " King Kong " .
367591	2707735	33870	10.0	" I can tell you a thousand tales of the men and women who have hunted this evil bird . "	" Casablanca " may have the most quoted lines in film history , but " The Maltese Falcon " , pound for pound , or I should say scene for scene , has the snappiest banter and greatest one liners of any film I've ever viewed . Most of them come from private detective Sam Spade ( Humphrey Bogart ) , and the tighter the fix , the more clever they are . My personal favorite is " How'd I kill him , I forget ? " , when Polhaus and Dundy ( Ward Bond and Barton MacLane ) interrogate Spade about the death of his partner . In fact , if you're not paying attention , a lot will sail completely over your head , so it's best to watch the film distraction free and with a scorecard to keep track of the players . The cast is a colorful lot , populated by both good guys and bad guys ( and gals ) . Mary Astor turns up early , and with more than one identity before Spade pins her down as one Brigid O'Shaughnessy . She's on the trail of a fortune disguised as a pawn shop rarity , a black enameled bird rumored to be the fabled Maltese Falcon . Hot on her heels are Kasper Gutman ( Sydney Greenstreet ) , in league with a sinister Joel Cairo ( Peter Lorre ) , and a hot headed gunsel named Wilmer Cook ( Elisha Cook Jr . ) . Each is a dangerous character , but Spade sizes them up appropriately . Of Wilmer - " The cheaper the crook , the gaudier the patter . " Have you ever heard a better description of a crook too big for his britches ? Understated though her role may be , Spade's assistant and gal Friday is a sheer delight ; Effie Perrine ( Lee Patrick ) appears to have been around the block a few times , and could be a worthy gumshoe herself . Note how she describes Iva Archer's belongings on the night her husband died , with an eye for detail and a sense of mystery . Sam knows he has an able assistant there , makes you wonder why he hasn't made a move on her himself , though he'd already compromised himself with his partner's wife . That's why it comes as somewhat of a surprise at film's end when Bogie's character comes through it all lily white , willing to throw Brigid over in the name of fair play and standing up for one's murdered partner - " Don't be too sure I'm as crooked as I'm supposed to be " . He'd already served up all the suspects to Polhaus in as neat a bundle as the real one , the black statuette , which turns out to have been a stand in for the real thing . It's still out there somewhere , casting it's lure for another gang like Gutman and company . Wondering aloud what the " dingus " sitting on Spade's table is , his reply to the detectives sums up what the film's three murders can only hint at - " The , uh , stuff that dreams are made of " .
367925	2707735	44706	10.0	" People gotta talk themselves inta law and order before they do anything about it . . . "	" High Noon " has always been one of my favorite Westerns , heck , it's one of my favorite films altogether . The theme music stays with me for days after each viewing , not such a bad thing , though my humming does grate on the rest of the family . My unofficial count after today's viewing caught eight instances of the theme interspersed with scenes from the movie , not counting the complete rendition offered at the opening . Director Fred Zinneman broke ranks with many Western film traditions in his approach to this classic , and concentrated on three main ingredients to build suspense in the story . The threat imposed by the returning Frank Miller was continually reinforced by the still shot of the looming railroad tracks on which the villain would arrive . Marshall Kane's ( Gary Cooper ) repeated requests for help would be summarily turned down by virtually everyone in a town that feared for each individual's personal safety . Thirdly , the repeated use of the clock image , beginning at 10 : 40 A . M . , is used as the countdown mechanism to herald an impending confrontation ; it's use helps build suspense right up until the fateful steam whistle sounds at high noon . The reason fans can relate to Gary Cooper's take on Marshal Kane is a movingly human one - he can admit that he's scared . Yet there's that gnawing sense of duty to service and facing one's challenges that surfaces and takes over to drive Kane toward his destiny . That doesn't mean that Kane can't despair when his only ally deputy Herb ( James Millican ) backs out . Sure , John Wayne might have handled it differently , but that character would have been a caricature . Kane was about to face his mortality , and it wasn't a rosy picture . One thing did puzzle me though . Once the showdown began , the first time Kane is fired upon by an off screen gunman , the bullet strikes the side of a barn about a foot over his left shoulder . At the same time Kane grabs his upper left arm as if he was wounded . His shirt from that point on is torn as if damaged by a bullet . The ballistics involved for that scenario just doesn't work , the bullet would have had to bounce off Kane's arm in an impossible trajectory . I got a kick out of Lloyd Bridges ' recollection of the fight scene in the stable between his character Harvey Pell and Kane . Lloyd's son Beau was six years old at the time and he wanted to witness the filming of the scene , so dad hid him in the hayloft above the stable . When Cooper doused Bridges with a pail of water at the close of the scene , Beau burst out laughing , and they had to shoot it all over again ! Upon repeat viewings , you might pay attention to some of the nuances that give the film even more subtlety and substance , like the look Helen Ramirez ( Katy Jurado ) gives Harvey when the Kane's ride back into town , or the barber regarding the number of coffins the town has on hand . I got a kick out of that actually , note the sign in the barber shop offering ' Complete Funeral Service and Undertaking ' . Nice touch . For it's effort , " High Noon " took home four Academy Awards , led by Gary Cooper's Best Actor . It's theme music was rewarded with a Best Original Song along with a Best Scoring Oscar . Not too shabby for a genre traditionally overlooked by the Academy . For me , " High Noon " is one of those pictures that I like to bring out about once every year or so just to keep me focused on what good , tight story telling is all about . It's a classic underdog tale that ranks right up there with films like " On The Waterfront " , and " To Kill a Mockingbird " , as the lone protagonist finds the will to rise to the occasion and stand up for what's right . For Western fans , it stands alongside " Shane " as one of the best of the genre , without using a lot of complex techniques to explain itself .
