368415	2707735	75881	1.0	" Prepare yourself for a big surprise . "	My summary line above is an actual quote from the movie . The surprise of course is whether you ever make it through the entire flick . Let's see - 1977 , " Star Wars " , and 1977 , " Cosmos : War of the Planets " . One is a landmark movie that took sci-fi film making into the twenty first century , the other set back the progress of civilization for time immemorial . My question is - Is this movie about anything at all ? It's virtually an endless stream of darkened scenes where crew members of a space ship called ' MK 31 ' attempt to defeat an alien intelligence that threatens Earth . The alien intelligence actually states to Captain Hamilton ( John Richardson ) that it will conquer the galaxy when he repairs a bad circuit board . So what does he do - he repairs the bad circuit board ! ! ! ! The only redeeming factor for this mess is the go-go style space suits , all white with a red skull cap and trim that look particularly fine on the good looking female crew members . Other than that , this film goes where no film has gone before , and will stay there by the look of the comments already posted . Fortunately or not as the case may be , this was the last movie left to view of my fifty DVD sci-fi collection from Mill Creek / Tree Line Films . A bargain at about twenty five bucks , this is the kind of movie that demands a refund , even if it's only fifty cents .
367847	2707735	147467	2.0	" . . . and then it happened , I gave myself to him . "	The severely dated production values and stiff performances by the actors immediately calls to mind another ' educational ' gem of the era - " Reefer Madness " . In the name of sex education and the eradication of the evils of socially transmitted disease , the film begins with the earnest entreaty that " Ignorance Must Be Abolished " . But actually , if the presentation wasn't so corny and outmoded , one would be hard pressed to consider whether anything's been learned since the film was made , as the toll in human lives to STD's worldwide is at epidemic proportions . I guess you'd really have to be a viewer back in the 1930's to get the full impact of how titillating a lot of the film was . The burlesque sequence offered a lot more tease than the actual dance show , with a lesbian pursuing a hot conquest and a dirty old man type getting worked up enough to attack the first young lady he sees after the show . The main story involves a would be actress falling victim to an unscrupulous director only to find herself at the mercy of the dreaded syphilis , ultimately infecting her new husband and baby . Not entirely unimaginable , but confounded by the unsavory practices of medical quacks who take advantage of the uneducated and uninformed . As a period piece , this is another example of sensationalist film making and worth a look to see how far we've come as a society and a nation . It's unlikely that anyone reading this was even alive seventy years ago when the film was made , and that in itself is a remarkable testament to the staying power of a cult classic from a bygone era .
368309	2707735	54333	2.0	" Just you try that baby cakes . "	Had Roger Corman's name been attached to this picture , I wouldn't have been surprised . It's like " Swamp Women " times two set in a more idyllic tropical locale , whose creatures of the title make only an intermittent appearance just to remind us it's supposed to be their story . But it never is , the very few times anything resembling a spider shows up it's heralded by goofy metallic outer space sci-fi music , and then . . . . nothing ! The central plot involving an agent , his girlfriend and seven would be dancers winds up with a Clipper 247 crashing into the ocean on the way to Singapore . From there the film makes it's way into soft porn territory as one by one , the girls shed their clothes and cavort on their island paradise , unfazed by the occasional dead body among them that under normal circumstances might raise an eyebrow or two . The film is a mess , and couldn't have done worse if each player was given carte blanch to make up their own story as they went along . Come to think of it , maybe they were . Hard to believe that as late as 1960 , films were still being made where story continuity took place seamlessly with scenes alternating between day and night . It's the only movie I've ever seen where two guys go inside to have a fight , with the expected result of cracking up over how ridiculous that was . In the end , you'll shout , you'll scream , you'll wonder how you ever made it to the end . Fortunately , there was still room in my Top Ten list of all time worst movies for this bomb , if only Spider Island can stay afloat .
368538	2707735	46066	2.0	" In the continuing war for survival between man and the hexapod , only another fool would bet against the insect . "	" Mesa of Lost Women " has two early hooks that make it seem that the movie is actually going somewhere . Even before any opening credits roll , there's the seductive scene with Tarantella ( Tandra Quinn ) using her nine inch nails on a hapless victim . The nails are never seen again . While in a mountaintop surrounded by desolation , Dr . Arana ( Jackie Coogan ) explains he's isolated the growth hormone of the anterior pituitary , the substance that controls the growth pattern of humans . The writers must have been so impressed with this line that they used it practically verbatim twice . You can turn off your player right there . The rest of the film implodes in a veritable nightmare of nonsense and head scratching goofiness . With monotone voice over narration complemented by inane dialog , and a soundtrack composed of an incessantly strumming Mexican guitar , the viewer is challenged beyond physical endurance . Hey , here's an idea . Maybe someone could develop a video game based on the concept of the dwarf heads that pop into view every few minutes to eyeball the stranded group on the mesa . At least Dr . Arana had the right idea . His experiments were successful in staffing the mesa laboratory with a bevy of Miss Universe contestants . Wow , didn't Tarantella's anterior pituitary go into overdrive during that dance at the Mexican cantina ? I was mesmerized until the guy on the phone says - " Sheriff , the body just got up and walked out of here . " Contrary to all leading indicators however , this movie does NOT make my Worst Ten list . For that , a film has to be so egregiously bad that you can't even make fun of it . " Mesa of Lost Women " at least qualifies as feature of the week at the Muerto State Asylum .
367711	2707735	61850	2.0	" OK , see you day before yesterday . "	It's hard to believe that movies as bad as this were being made as late as 1967 . It's about as technologically advanced as any " B " grade film from the ' 40's , but done in color . However the garish orange of the lab setting and time capsule is so bright it will make you grab for a pair of sunglasses . So much for the high points . " Journey to the Center of Time " would be an embarrassment for a fledgling film student , that it was made at all with real money is to be questioned as much as the film's star Scott Brady questions his company's funding of research in the science of time travel . For two years , Doc Gordon ( Abraham Sofaer ) , Mark Manning ( Anthony Eisley ) and Karen White ( Gigi Perreau ) have only managed to navigate twenty four hours into the past . That's all about to change , as the trio , along with owner Stanton ( Brady ) kick start their time travel gizmo five thousand years into the future for a rendezvous with aspiring screen star Poupee Gamin , surely you recognize her name . One of her futuristic aides is Lyle Waggoner , who fortunately managed to survive this mess to earn a spot on the Carol Burnett Show and later , " Wonder Woman " . The time lab can best be compared to a time travel boomerang ; from the future the gang whips back to one million years B . C . to pick a nice round number , where the greedy Stanton grabs a jewel and takes off in the lab once again , stranding Manning and White in the past . In a series of frenetic flashbacks and flash forwards , the entire movie is relived for those of you who dozed off the first time . Getting beyond the embarrassment , you can have a fun time with this one as long as it's with a bunch of friends and the right mix of refreshments . The film can be enjoyed on many levels ; I know because it made as much sense played in reverse as it did played forward .
368070	2707735	200402	3.0	" It's only a building , lives are more important . "	The ninja kids in question are descendants of the Ming Dynasty who wear a talisman of their origin . The Ching want to kill them to remove all trace of their heritage . Just about the entire film is spent by the young martial artists in training with stone benches that will come in handy for the film's climax when they must do battle with the evil emperor in a giant spinning top . You couldn't make this up , so I'm wondering how they got that into the film . The movie mildly explores the relationship of an overbearing master who relentlessly trains his protégés , punishing them when they misbehave or don't perform to perfection . The scene when Wu Chan slaps the youngest boy changed the entire flavor of the story for me , especially since he didn't redeem himself in any way later on . The attempts at humor generally fall flat , like the pair of lanky warriors who might have been the two stooges of kung fu . There is one comedic scene done particularly well though . A few of the boys come upon a young female martial artist taking a bath in the river and one of the boys remarks - " Brother , why doesn't she have this ? " , while another checks his own anatomy for reassurance . I was perplexed by one scene near the end of the movie when the ninjas were working out in the cave . There on the floor in rather bold relief and colored in red was a large swastika . No mention of it was offered in the story , but it sure looked strange . Not being a big fan of the genre , I was intrigued enough to pick up this DVD when I saw the title in a bargain bin at a local store , especially since it was paired with another flick called " Little Mad Guy " . It only cost a buck , and to be honest , it was worth every penny , which is to say , about fifty cents worth .
367596	2707735	70569	3.0	" I wouldn't give you a plug nickel against fifty honest to God brass button soldiers . "	Chuck Connors and Cesar Romero head an otherwise unknown cast in this tale set in South America in 1870 , as Will Hansen ( Connors ) leads a group of four ex-Confederate soldiers now plying their trade as mercenaries . Hansen is the only member of the band that seems to have any hint of a hard edge , the rest are just a bunch of good old boys with no drive or direction of their own . The South American setting could be just about anywhere since no country is ever named , but it might just as well have been Mexico for the portrayal offered by the two opposing forces . On one side , General Alehandro Martinez offers Hansen and his comrades pay in exchange for information on the opposition in the valley town of San Carlos . Cesar Romero is the mayor there , determined to protect his town , but one wonders from what . The conflict between Martinez and Romero is never made known , maybe that's why Hansen and his men have no emotional involvement in the proceedings . It would be difficult to describe the action in the film - there is none . There are two romantic angles involving Hansen and a gypsy woman , while one of his men named Ike ( Aron Kincaid ) tries to woo a senorita from the local convent . If the film's pace wasn't slow enough as it was , it's accentuated by the doleful strumming of a guitar from time to time , bringing one's attention to the fact that nothing is going on . All doesn't go well for Hansen though , since he missed his appointment with General Martinez , he'll have to pay for that indiscretion . That prompts his men to think for themselves for the first time , and they take a stand with the citizens of San Carlos . You'll have to watch the film to see how far that goes , but even amidst the flying cannonballs , it's kind of anti climactic . One never feels any empathy for this bunch , and that's what makes the movie largely forgettable . If you're a Chuck Connors fan , you'll be better served by any single episode of his " Rifleman " , which will have more story and excitement to it in twenty six minutes than this hour and a half sleeper . The only thing I found interesting in the film was how much Connors appeared to have aged in the decade since the Rifleman series ended . Oh wait , maybe it happened during the filming !
368280	2707735	39743	3.0	" Well , you wanted jungle , from here on you've got it . "	The fact that nothing about this movie makes any sense is what also gives it it's dubious charm . I have to say the movie's opening had a pretty decent hook with the elephant procession in Akbar , India , while a pretty but demure Indian girl held out the hope of a mysterious adventure . Once on safari though , things take a downhill turn as wildlife stock footage threatens to overtake the main story , easily eating up a third of the film . Even the movie's title , " Queen of the Amazons " turns out to be a contradiction , as the main story plays out in Africa . In retrospect , the action could have taken place in South America just as easily , but then the film would be making a concession to at least one plot point . After all the intrigue inspired by talk of bad voodoo surrounding the jungle white goddess / she devil , it's almost comical to observe the Amazon Queen Zita ( Amira Moustafa ) coochie cooing with her boyfriend Greg Jones ( Bruce Edwards ) . Greg never bothered to get in touch with his fiancée about a change in plans , so now Jean Preston ( Patricia Morison ) is leading the search to find him . Side stories abound in this clunker , as expedition guide Gary Lambert ( Robert Lowery ) has it bad for Jean after it was established that he considers women on safari a nuisance . There's also the identity of an ivory poacher to be revealed , which doesn't take too much to figure out . Hint , it's the cook spouting bad poetry ( J . Edward Bromberg ) , who could have been given any kind of name besides Gabby , because after all , Gabby belongs in a Western . By the time it's all over , you'll be pretty much standing on your head trying to sort this all out . Fearless Zita ( remember that speech to Jean ) screams in fright when Gabby throws a spear in her direction . The icing on the cake though is the double ring ceremony at the end of the film , with the Amazon leader proclaiming that she's ready to leave her paradise - huh ? It was at that point that Greg Jones ' earlier comment made a whole lot of sense to me - " Zita dear , you're quite a queen . "
368343	2707735	52072	3.0	" OK , you bloodsucking weasel , where's Manfred ? "	The lone trivia note regarding this film states that it was made in color and released in the U . S . in black and white . Surprisingly then I suppose , the color version shows up on a three DVD / nine movie set of films from St . Clair Vision under their ' Pirates ' compilation . Echoing the sentiment of the only other reviewer for the film at this time , charisma is a word that need not apply here . In fact it takes some doing to figure out what's going on , but the basics are something like this . A usurper to the throne of Monteforte has done away with the Duke and has kidnapped his young son ( even though a quick storyboard at the beginning of the film states the Duke is in exile ) . Manfred ( Andrea Aureli ) is supported by Saracen pirates looking a bit like members of the Papal Royal Guard . A rival band of pirates from the Black Hawk are led by Captain Richard ( Gerard Landry ) , attempting to set things right by the original Duke . The Duke of Monteforte happened to have a rather beautiful daughter Eleanor ( Pina Bottin ) , thereby providing for the romantic angle . There you have it , that's about all you need to know before , during , or after the film is over . I would hope the original Italian dialog was more original than the English translation , which featured such Twentieth Century clichés ( in a Fifteenth Century setting ) as - " It's no good , let's make a break for it ! " In fact the most inspired line I heard in the film was the ' bloodsucking weasel ' reference in my summary above . Listen , you won't lose a lot of sleep if you pass on this salty sea tale on land , or conversely , if you do watch it , it just might put you to sleep . The best thing this one has going for it is the U . S . release title - " The Pirate of the Black Hawk " .
367608	2707735	44406	3.0	" And how are you today my little anthropoid ? "	The first time I ever heard of this title I thought it was a joke ; it was in reference to a movie poster for the film . Ever since , I've been on the lookout for the movie in any form , and today was my lucky day , in a manner of speaking . Not only did I find the DVD for just a buck , but the picture quality was excellent . That's where the superlatives end however , though as other reviewers have pointed out , this one merits viewing just because it's so goofy and entertaining . The Martin and Lewis shtick gets stood on it's ear by Duke Mitchell and Sammy Petrillo , a couple of characters I've never heard of , yet they appear here using their own names . Bela Lugosi gets to use HIS own name in the title , but portrays Dr . Zabor , a mad scientist working on experiments in evolution on the Pacific Island of Cola Cola . But the best casting decision in more ways than one was the role of Charlita as Nona , reminiscent of the part played by Zulu as Kono in the Hawaii Five-O TV Series of the late 1960's . I mean , what's the point , why not let them use their own names too . Lest I forget to mention it , the plot ( if there is one ) involves the jealous Dr . Zabor injecting Duke with his monkey serum , turning him into a man in a gorilla suit . Talk about typecasting - if you needed a man in a gorilla suit in the 1940's , you called Ray " Crash " Corrigan , a veteran of a fair share of " B " Westerns who somehow wound up in such monkey shines as " The Ape " ( 1940 ) , Nabonga ( 1944 ) and " The Monster and the Ape " ( 1945 ) . As an ape , Corrigan is no Andy Serkis but he's fun to watch . I guess fun is the operative word for this film . There's nothing here to be taken seriously at all , and Bela Lugosi must have known that too because he spends a good deal of time smiling broadly in the movie . For once I didn't feel victimized by the film's ending when it's revealed that the island action was all a dream . But it could after all have actually happened , since Passaic , New Jersey isn't that far from the Bronx Zoo !
368300	2707735	61217	4.0	" Are you people positive you know what you're doing ? "	Interplanetary hitchhiker Zontar sets his sights on Earth , communicating with scientist Keith Ritchie ( Tony Houston ) via a home made radio set up that's actually more impressive looking than all the room size computer equipment at the " Installation " . Houston resembles Jerry Seinfeld with a hard edge , so watching the film today makes his performance doubly amusing . I just love hearing the pseudo scientific explanations offered for all the mumbo jumbo in these grade ' Z ' sci-fi flicks , and " Zontar " doesn't let you down . Starting with a brief mention of hyperspace hypnotism , the film is on it's way with tales of injector pods and biological implants . The film is at it's most surreal though when John Agar trades in his cavalry mount for a bicycle , tooling around town in a business suit . His character is Dr . Curt Taylor , who gives it his all in trying to prevent Zontar's domination of earth , eight people at a time . But do you think he really had to kill his wife when she became a Zontar zombie ? Gee , maybe he could have figured something else out before the picture ended . It's amazing how sequestered every small town is in these types of flicks , the outside world is never heard from so it can lend a hand . At least The General ( Neil Fletcher ) makes mention of a Communist conspiracy to remind today's viewer of what was on a lot of people's minds back in the ' 50's and ' 60's . Can you believe that was so long ago ? Give Zontar credit though . He combines vacation plans with thoughts of global domination , preferring a locale noted for it's hot springs , with a bit of spelunking thrown in as well in the underground caves . Seems to me though he could have been more consistent with turning mechanical devices on and off at will . I guess he just didn't see that sting gun with the plutonium ruby crystal coming - too bad . Hey , don't blink . Right in the middle of all the fun is a quick flash of a woman in a bikini for no apparent reason . It's one of the endearing scenes that make Zontar a blast , even if you don't believe in hyperspace hypnotism .
368273	2707735	33760	4.0	" Do I look pale ? . . . I feel pale . "	Bela Lugosi portrays Charles Kessler , in denial over his wife's running off with another man years ago , and now missing or presumed dead since being involved in a car crash which killed her husband . Yet she's living secretly in the basement of the gardener's shed , believing she's dead , and occasionally strolling out to the grounds of the estate in her bathrobe . Now read those two sentences once again , because if you buy it , you won't have any trouble with the rest of the film . Whenever Kessler sees his wife , he goes into a catatonic trance like state , doing a Frankenstein walk as he finds a victim to strangle within his home . It's usually one of the staff , and with good help hard to find , this could be a bit troublesome . After his daughter's boyfriend is conveniently convicted for the murder of the maid , the lookalike brother conveniently shows up with enough common sense to help the inept police department figure out what's going on . There are some redeeming qualities to the film though . There's an interesting camera technique used for parlor shots done through the flames of the fireplace framing the characters inside . It's rather well done and memory doesn't recall it's use in any other films . Additionally , the part of black Butler Evans is played straight and dignified by Clarence Muse , unusual for the era , when many black parts were either racially denigrated or played for comic relief . When Muse's character failed to slide into stereotype , especially under questioning by the police , it was a refreshing relief . " The Invisible Ghost " probably won't make anyone's top ten horror list , or even top ten Lugosi list , though some of the prior postings on this film did surprise me . Although not " must see " in the usual sense , it does merit a viewing for a well rounded appreciation of Bela Lugosi's film credits .
367614	2707735	27255	4.0	" Ace , you were cold decked by that gambler in Nevada , and he's deader now than my Aunt Emma's hopes of matrimony . "	As the film's title suggests , the famed aces and eights poker hand plays a role in the outcome of the story , but this time it's not a murder . Cowboy star Tim McCoy portrays Gentleman Tim Madigan , a card sharp who's not above a little bottom dealing himself . His reputation is so renowned that posters warn other gamblers to keep their distance from the well dressed poker player . Madigan's sidekick is a fellow named Lucky ( Jimmy Aubrey ) , who keeps a pair of dice handy to consider what the day will bring . They ride across the border to Roaring Gulch , California following the murder of a fellow gambler that's pinned on Madigan . Madigan doesn't wear a gun , relying on his wits and power ; he can tear a deck of cards into quarters . In Roaring Gulch he's befriended by Don Julio Hernandez ( Joseph Girard ) and his daughter Juanita ( Luana Walters ) , while her brother Jose mistakenly believes he's the one responsible for the murder back in Nevada . In an effort to save the Hernandez ranch from crooked saloon owner Amos Harden ( Frank Glendon ) , Madigan challenges him to a poker hand using a clean deck . Seems to me that was quite a gamble , even IF Lucky rolled a seven that day . Perhaps in the end it was Tim McCoy's steely gaze that saved the day , I've never seen it better . The Marshal ( Earl Hodgins ) tailing Madigan becomes convinced that he's innocent of the Nevada murder when Madigan pulls a slug out of a wall fired from Ace Morgan's ( Wheeler Oakman ) derringer . It matches up with the slug found near the dead body , in a logic defying exercise in ballistics , since the bullet had to go entirely through the dead man's body and then fall to his side . Not only that , but the Marshal had to find it ! I'd like to see the Warren Commission explain that one . At least one interesting custom is explained in the course of the story , though I don't know if there's any basis in fact for it . At the Hernandez ranch , a chalice of gold coins , ' La Copa D'Oro ' , is on display in one of the rooms . The custom says that the coins are for any guest who finds himself truly in need , and even a thief would not dishonor that generosity . Given the story line and the opportunities made available to tempt fate , the cup made it to the end of the tale untouched . That at least seemed a lot more credible than the exact same ' aces and eights ' poker hand showing up at different times in the story , to the point of matching the fifth card in the hand each time .
368496	2707735	58084	4.0	" When life is suspended , time has no meaning at all . "	" Frozen Alive " plays it straight throughout it's eighty minute running time , and that might be it's biggest downside . With no pseudo scientific jargon to camp it up and little in the way of action , the film offers an early look at the field of cryogenics with a slight detour into a murder mystery . Dr . Frank Overton ( Mark Stevens ) and his assistant Dr . Helen Wieland are about to make a significant breakthrough in their research after chimpanzees frozen to eighty below zero are revived unharmed after three months . The next step is to find a human volunteer to undergo the same deep freeze treatment and prove that medical science can benefit from the process . However Overton's wife Joan ( Delphi Lawrence ) is extremely jealous of her husband's lab time with Helen , and seeks comfort from former flame Tony ( Joachim Hansen ) and refuge in a bottle . Giving new meaning to the term soused , Joan shoots herself in Tony's apartment and makes her husband a widower . He doesn't know it yet , because he's advanced the cause of science by becoming a guinea pig for his own experiment . Everything just described occurs in a rather monotone and understated fashion , and without even the help of a musical score to emphasize the high points , the film fails to deliver . The detectives who arrive at the lab wishing to interrogate Overton as a suspect in his wife's death seem virtually uninterested in the fact that he's a human popsicle . Keeping her own feelings for Overton in check , Dr . Wieland almost pulls the plug on him by botching the revival , while colleagues just stand around performing her instructions . At least the rhythm of Overton's heartbeat keep things suspenseful until it's learned that Mrs . O's gunshot wound was self inflicted . This film offered the hope of much more in the way of mystery and thrills but comes up short in both departments . As far as a recommendation , I would advise to keep this one on ice until you've exhausted the rest of your movie library .
368254	2707735	38246	4.0	" All right Mumbo Jumbo , bring the Fraulein with us . "	I went into " White Pongo " cold , preferring not to read the DVD sleeve to get a hint of the story . Lo and behold , it's another in a long line of gorilla films that found popularity in the 1940's , that perhaps thought it could enrich itself with a name no one had ever heard of before or since . Pongo rhymes with Congo , and that's where the action takes place , as an expedition heads into gorilla territory to seek out what may be the missing link between monkeys and men . Not only that , but the animal in question is a rare white gorilla , thought to be highly secretive and very hard to find , but is never more than a few feet away in any scene involving the intrepid explorers . Maris Wrixon provides the film's female lead and romantic interest , Pamela Bragdon . She's the daughter of Sir Harry ( Gordon Richards ) , and insists on being part of the adventure , citing her experience of having been born on a safari . She has eyes for her personal guard Bishop ( Richard Fraser ) , who's mission on the trip is of a dual nature ; he's really an agent attempting to get the goods on safari guide Hans Kroegert ( Al Eben ) , who may have murdered anthropologist Dierdorf . It's Dierdorf's diary that offers a clue to the white pongo creature's existence . Critics of the filmed versions of " King Kong " who find racism behind every banana tree would really have a field day with this one . The Number # 1 Porter Boy is called Mumbo Jumbo ( really , I'm not making this up ! ) , and it's a " white " gorilla considered the missing link , not a black one . I try not to get involved in political correctness with Poverty Row films dealing in monkeys , so those arguments are best left for another time . This movie is best viewed with a healthy dose of good humor and good friends . I will say there's a nifty fight scene between a " normal " gorilla and the pongo ; they batter each other with uprooted trees in a creative slug fest . Before it's all over , the white gorilla rescues Miss Pamela from the evil German guide ( Nazi overtones anyone ? ) and carries her off to his cave ; Pongo is no Kong however and has to hoist her over his shoulder . What's probably most disappointing about the movie is the way it ends . The expedition members capture the creature and crate him up for shipment to London . The film closes on that note , leaving the viewer to consider that maybe the movie makers dropped the ball , having never heard of sequel . This critic at least would have preferred to see the animal go free to create havoc another day in " The Return of White Pongo " . Oh well , maybe someone will remake " King Kong " . Oh , wait . . .
367744	2707735	49403	4.0	" Just one thing Jason , rifles and women don't mix . "	Nor apparently , do rifles and Comanches , as the Indians are shown to be willing to fight and kill for them , or conversely , are willing to fight and kill once they have them . I couldn't help thinking while watching , as another viewer commented on this board , that here was a half century early preview of the politics of appeasement that the liberal Democrats are waging during the present day Iraqi War . Let's just give the enemy what they want and go on our way , because then they'll be satisfied and leave us alone . The story , one might surmise , stays in one place literally and figuratively for it's entire run . A broken down Conestoga wagon remains behind for a wheel to be fixed as negotiations get under way as to how to deal with the hostiles . It's unfortunate that the nominal leader of this piece , Jason Clay ( Lance Fuller ) was the one to waver in his determination to get the wagon through with one hundred Kentucky rifles intact . That resolve was maintained by sidekick Tobias ( Chill Wills ) , shown to be correct when the Comanches force their own hand by shooting their bargaining chip Foster ( Jess Barker ) . Interesting how one can see more clearly when when one's life is on the line . The sub plot of a romantic triangle among Clay , Foster and Amy Connors ( Cathy Downs ) wasn't particularly necessary for the story , and didn't wind up contributing to the finale . However it allowed for Chill Wills ' character to fire off a couple references to how women and rifles don't mix , even if the connection was virtually negligible . It seems to me the run in with the Comanches would have occurred with or without women along for the ride . I don't think it's necessary to be as hard on the flick as other posters for this film have been , but it sure did take a long time to get from Point A to Point B as has been pointed out . Sterling Holloway gets minimal mileage out of his home made still bit , and Wills is mildly entertaining with ' Sweet Bessie From Pike ' . It gets a little embarrassing though to see how much confidence he places in his own Kentucky Rifle , especially when he offers up a prayer to help him shoot straight .
367848	2707735	30845	4.0	" Seems to me , I smell somethin ' that should be buried , smelly like a polecat . "	Since adding the Encore Western Channel to my cable TV lineup I've been overdosing on that particular genre , so I thought I'd take a break to check out a four disc , twenty movie DVD package I picked up from Mill Creek Entertainment . It's called ' Cult Classics ' , and the title that immediately called out to me was " Terror Of Tiny Town " . Wouldn't you know it , the darn thing turned out to be a midget Western . No , not a short feature , but a movie with an all midget cast ! It came out the same year as another novelty Western featuring an all Black cast called " Two Gun Man From Harlem " . The principle is pretty much the same here . Take your standard ' B ' oater , pit your white hat hero against a dastardly villain , and populate it with nothing but midget actors . What's sort of cool in the story is the early misdirection which seems to implicate Tex Preston ( Billy Platt ) as a cattle rustler before it's revealed there's a third party villain working the Preston's against the Lawson's . Bat Haines ( Little Billy Rhodes ) is as nasty a villain as you'll find in any John Wayne , Roy Rogers or Durango Kid picture , even to the tune of keeping the local sheriff in his pocket . The hero of the piece , Buck Lawson is played by Billy Curtis in his very first film role . Obviously he caught someone's eye to recommend casting him as the mayor of Munchkin Land in 1939's " Wizard of Oz " , from there going on to a rather prodigious movie career . Western fans will note the resemblance between the young Curtis in ' Tiny Town ' and the sixty four year old actor who was made mayor of Lago by The Stranger in " High Plains Drifter " . To his credit , Curtis did his best to stay away from roles that denigrated little people , and did a creditable job here . Still , it's hard watching the picture not to crack up every now and then over inadvertently funny scenes like the midget cowboys riding on their Shetland ponies , or walking into a saloon under the swinging door . The movie opted to drift back and forth between a normal adult size world and a miniature one to achieve different effects ; the scene I thought was exceptional was the one that played out with the runaway stagecoach built to little people scale . Some of the goofier scenes involved pint size singers whose voices were obviously dubbed . " The Terror of Tiny Town " won't make anyone's best films list , but you know , it really shouldn't be on anyone's worst list either . Take it with a grain of salt and you'll probably be entertained . A couple questions need answering though . Why was that penguin in the middle of the movie ? And if a regular cowboy fires a six-shooter , does a midget use a three-shooter ?
368216	2707735	28194	5.0	" Hey , are you the Three Meskeeters ? "	What got my attention right out of the gate was how young the principles were in this early Three Mesquiteers outing - Robert Livingston , Ray Corrigan and Max Terhune , the trio that participated in the most number of films as the title characters . " Roarin ' Lead " was only the third film in the series that eventually stretched to fifty one pictures , so it's not surprising that the boys still had that youthful appearance . As for the story , and this is not meant as a put down , but it's a largely forgettable one that once again explores a crooked town boss ( Hooper Atchley ) who's taking out local ranchers via the old rustlers stealing cattle gimmick , but with a bit of a twist . Hackett ( Atchley ) , as president of the Cattlemen's Protective Association , was paying out insurance claims on the stolen beef , but with funds running low , he intended to foreclose on the local orphanage , thereby adding a valuable piece of real estate to his holdings . Bad mistake - the Mesquiteers turn up as the trustees of the Clark Estate , majority stake holders in the company that owns the orphanage . What's different about this early oater is the inclusion of a variety show put on by the orphans who try to save their home . I would never have thought about the possibility , but Miss Doris ( Christine Maple ) actually frowned on adoption if it meant that the children would go to parents whose only intent was to use the kids as ' slave labor ' on their respective ranches . That term - ' slave labor ' - was used more than once , and really made me think about how kids might have been taken advantage of in a situation that presumably would have been for their benefit . Hey , did you catch that cliff jump into the lake by Stony ( Livingston ) and Tucson ( Corrigan ) to escape the bad guy posse ? And you thought that Butch and Sundance scene was entirely original ! I was surprised at the amount of screen time given to Yakima Canutt as henchman Canary , since he wasn't Hatchett's top gun , but reporting to George Chesebro's Captain Gardner . But the Swami gimmick that exposes Yak with an injured wrist was pretty lame , with Hackett making his own matters worse by trying to gun the good guys in a crowded hall . There wasn't too much thought put into these stories when you come right down to it , but if you're a fan like me , you're willing to cut everyone involved a little slack . Not too much more to add except for the puzzler ending - Did Lullaby ( Max Terhune ) really adopt Bobby ? ? ? ! ! !
368352	2707735	72615	5.0	" Well now , that's a freak of nature to behold . "	A young Sam Sutter ( Stewart Petersen ) sets out to rescue his older sister , captured by a trio of Indian braves at the Sutter homestead while they were the only two there . Apparently , Sam is motivated by an earlier conversation with Charlotte ( Jewel Blanch ) , who with Bible firmly in hand , declared that she would be willing to give her own life for a member of her family if that be her fate . Sam's mission almost ends before it begins , if not for the life saving action of the Russian , an old coot of an alcoholic prospector , who's life affirming motto seems to be " nothin ' prettier than sweet yeller gold " . The Russian is enthusiastically portrayed by the old paladin himself , Richard Boone , somewhat heavier and a lot more grizzled than his earlier TV Western character . The Russian's crusty mettle is challenged time and time again on the trail , with his trusty canine friend B'arkiller at his side . The key to Charlotte's location is learned by befriending a feeble old Indian discovered at a Cheyenne camp known by the Russian . Cut Tongue ( Henry Wilcoxon ) is at a disadvantage however , as his name implies ; he lost his tongue when captured by the Cheyenne and has been their slave ever since . His sign language and drawings in the dirt lead the Russian and Sam to the unnamed tribe that took Charlotte away . It's a wary squaw named Ashkea ( Brenda Venus ) that reunites Sam with Charlotte at the Indian camp . Seeing the love between brother and sister , Ashkea is moved to tears , unable to comprehend the devotion the two have for each other . Ashkea figures in the film's surprise ending , though observant viewers will probably see it coming well before it's revelation at the very end . Filmed in Deluxe Color , the movie was heavy on the blues and greens , and along with some washed out scenes the movie had it's distractions . As slowly as the first half moved , the latter part of the film had a forced pace that seemed off balance , especially when it came to young Sam's challenge . Originally intended to be a race against warrior Temkai , it turned out to be a race against time , with a questionable outcome the result . As a nice touch , the movie's title song is performed by Jewel Blanch , heard once midstream , and then again at the final curtain . It's not enough though to raise the film much above average , though as others have noted , it's sentimental treatment of family love and loyalty is a rarity by today's standards .
367861	2707735	37084	5.0	" The dead have no place for the living . "	Having just seen Boris Karloff in " The Ape " , I was somewhat taken aback to see another " man in a gorilla suit " sharing office space with the protagonist of " The Monster Maker " . Though not credited , I wouldn't be surprised to learn if it was Ray " Crash " Corrigan in the get up , up to his old monkey shines once again . In the movie , J . Carrol Naish portrays mad scientist ( is there any other kind in these 1940 era poverty row productions ? ) Dr . Igor Markoff , suddenly smitten with the appearance of Patricia Lawrence , daughter of famed concert pianist Anthony Lawrence ( Ralph Morgan ) . You see , she's a dead ringer for the mad doctor's own deceased wife , who we learn committed suicide when she was reduced to the ugliness of acromegaly , a disfiguring disease which is glandular in origin . Markoff had injected her with a serum when a romantic rival tried to steal her away years ago so he could have her all to himself . Obviously , Markoff believed in the adage - beauty's only skin deep . Markoff's plan to win Patricia involve injecting Lawrence with the acromegaly virus , with promise of a cure if the pianist can convince Patricia ( Wanda McKay ) to marry him . The makeup job on Lawrence was surprisingly well done , without being too outlandish . Holding out as long as he can , Lawrence finally seeks Markoff's help , but rather than committing to assist him in his scheme , he becomes Markoff's prisoner , with Markoff pulling more strings to entice Patricia to his lair . As usual , good triumphs over evil , as Lawrence breaks his bonds and wrestles a handgun away from Markoff , shooting him in the tussle . Markoff's able assistant Maxine ( Tala Birell ) , offers hope for a full recovery , as she is familiar with the doctor's work , and knows just where the X-54 serum antidote can be found - very convenient . The film ends as it opened , with Lawrence performing in concert to an appreciative audience that includes Patricia , her fiancé Bob , and Maxine , none the worse for wear for having endured his debilitating condition . Final mention must be made of Markoff's brutish lab assistant , played by veteran " B " heavy Glenn Strange , usually to be found in hastily turned out Westerns of the era . However in his career , he managed to portray the iconic Frankenstein on three occasions ( " House of Frankenstein " , " House of Dracula " and " Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein " ) . The twist in this film is the name he was given , for once the mad doctor was called Igor , and the assistant was " Steve " !
368044	2707735	34959	5.0	" I like women who ain't all sawdust inside . "	All the elements were here for an intriguing and gritty gangster / prison drama , but once Dot Burton ( Faye Emerson ) wound up at the penitentiary , the film started a lot to resemble a high school sorority league . All smiles and chatty , Dot and her new jailbird friend Myrtle ( Julie Bishop ) wind up scheming about how she can make the best of her sentence , until the time comes to claim the forty thousand dollars she scammed from her bumbling partners . I have to give the film makers credit for dressing up mobster Carey Wells ( Roland Drew ) in drag , that was both clever and corny at the same time . I'd love to know how many takes were necessary to film the visitation scene when Dot's ' sister ' comes to see her in prison . The relationship between Dot Burton and Ken Phillips ( Frank Wilcox ) didn't quite work for me either , especially from her side . I mean seriously , what did she see in this guy to spark a romantic angle ? Especially since she knew him as an adult when she was still a kid . The plot would have worked without going for this stretch . The surprise for me in the story was one of Jackie Gleason's very early screen appearances when he was still using the middle initial ' C ' . Unfortunately he didn't have a whole lot to do as the gang's getaway driver . If you get the chance , try to catch him in the Bogart film " All Through The Night " where in a similar role he gets to weigh in on World War II military strategy and how the Allies could win . As I sit here writing this , the thought occurred to me that as a Warner Brothers film , this could just as easily have been an East Side Kids story , with all the female leads replaced by Billy Halop , Bobby Jordan , Leo Gorcey , Huntz Hall , et al . Throw in Ann Sheridan for the Ken Phillips character and you would have had a much livelier story . Still , at just a couple of minutes over an hour , " Lady Gangster " is an interesting little diversion , but don't go in expecting to see a real lady gangster .
367752	2707735	43694	5.0	" When there's trouble in the jungle , it's everybody's business . "	I was getting a little worried , almost an hour into the picture and Jungle Jim ( Johnny Weissmuller ) still hadn't tangled with a wild animal yet , but at 58 : 08 he makes short work of a shark - no battle actually , he just stabs it ! That was right after the shark beat up on an octopus , so maybe he was too tired to fight . What's curious to me was how a shark and an octopus found their way into an African river . Besides the battle of sea creatures , we're also treated to a tussle between a pair of dinosaur impersonating lizards , one of which had a dimetrodon fin attached to it's back . Pretty cool stuff for a kid watching this stuff back in the 1950's , because after all , I was one of them . As for the movie's main plot , you really have to pay attention to let the whole thing sink in . An evil scientific genius ( Lyle Talbot ) discovers that boiling igneous rock will release the liquids and gases in it's magma composition , and when common sugar is added , a residue of carbon from the burned sugar is held suspended by the magma . Then when the whole solution is immersed in cold water , what's left is re-crystallized into synthetic diamonds - Whew ! When I tried it , I only got a hot , wet rock . You know , I think they made all that up . There must have been a reason each Jungle Jim movie offered a different female lead , this time it was Sheila Ryan as spunky photographer Ann Lawrence . They're out to find a former All-American football player who went missing in the jungle some nine years earlier . The opening film credits state ' Introducing ' Bob Waterfield , a real life pro player and coach for the Los Angeles Rams . The ' introduction ' tag is usually meant to herald an up and coming new star , but in this case , Waterfield's performance was decidedly less successful than his football career . At least Rick Vallin turns up one more time as yet another tribal chief named Bono , causing me to wonder where the current rock star Bono's name actually came from - Hmm . And say , you know who else gets an opening film credit - Tamba The Chimp ! ! I got a kick out of an early scene when Miss Lawrence first meets Jungle Jim when he saves her from drowning . Admiring his features , she asks him to ' turn your head to the right ' , to which he turns his head left ! Having seen about a half dozen Jungle Jim films recently , I have to admit that once viewed , they're largely forgettable , but at least when they're on they offer a lot of fun , even if some of it is just plain goofy . This one though , I must say probably had the best ending of one so far . Not only does Ann Lawrence get to kiss Jim's co-hero Bob Miller ( Waterfield ) , but Tamba gets to plant one on Jungle Jim himself !
368229	2707735	23556	5.0	" I'll knock her nose around her ear ! "	Starting out , I'd have to say that you'd be hard pressed to come up with a more attractive screen couple than the young James Cagney and Loretta Young . What got them there however , and what ensues is a somewhat haphazard mess of a story , though memorable for a lot of great scenes and characterizations , not the least of which is a quick appearance by George Raft during a dance contest ! As always , Cagney lights up the screen with his commanding presence ; here he's an independent taxi cab driver about to get embroiled in a dispute against a rival cab company that threatens the livelihood of the independents . Young's character , Sue Riley , is the daughter of a cab driver who dies in Sing Sing after killing a Consolidated goon who wrecked his vehicle . Uncharacteristically , Sue pleads for restraint at a meeting of the independent drivers , embarrassing Matt Nolan ( Cagney ) who wants more aggressive action . The first ' huh ? ' moment of the story occurs when Nolan and Sue are seen getting lovey dovey on line at a movie theater , when in the moment earlier scene she slapped his face , prompting the Cagney quote in my summary line above . But say , wasn't that the slickest wedding proposal ever when Cagney slipped the ring on Young's finger ? - very smooth ! The film gets some good mileage out of secondary characters as well , with George E . Stone as Nolan's pal Skeets , and Sue's girlfriend Ruby , played by Leila Bennett . Ruby is comically annoying with her ceaseless chatter about nothing in particular , though conversations about fish dying an unnatural death and her own matrimonial prospects are noteworthy . It was probably convenient for her to be dating Skeets whenever the couples went out , but how would you like to be on the receiving end of " Come on , I feel like being bored and you can do the job better than anybody I know . " You know , it didn't surprise me when she told Skeets her favorite actor was Joe E . Brown - who would have guessed ? Still , if you examine the film with any sense of credibility , you'll be left wondering about a whole host of questions . Like what did Marie ( Doroth Burgess ) ever see in Buck Gerard ( David Landau ) ? What would make ANYONE think they could get financial help for the killer of one's own brother-in law ? How could Sue rat out her husband when the cops came calling on the Gerard apartment ( quite convenient timing I might add ) ? And why , oh why , didn't Nolan , or anyone , ever reveal to Sue Riley that it was Buck Gerard who set up her father's ' incident ' that sent him away to prison ? Which makes the ending just a little TOO tidy for my taste , not that Matt and Sue couldn't live happily ever after , but geez , she pulled a gun on him just a few scenes earlier . BUT , if you're a James Gagney fan , this is a pretty good showcase for his talent , including some snappy Yiddish dialog , a fox trot that should have beaten Raft , and a quick tap dance at Sue's apartment . I'll watch it again !
368390	2707735	28589	5.0	" Maybe angel face can talk her way out of this one " .	I saw this film under the title " The Marijuana Menace " , and like that other period film about the ' dreaded weed ' - " Reefer Madness " , this one purports to be an instructional film about the evils of drugs and the consequences they lead to . I found this to be somewhat more titillating than it's counterpart , with a livelier bunch of partying teenagers . The opening sequence offers stern warnings about the use of marijuana with such newspaper headlines as ' Marijuana Crazed Youth Kills ' and ' Marijuana Deals Death ' . It would be great to hear commentary from someone who saw one of these films back when it was made to understand if the one sided nature of these pictures actually had an influence on anyone . They seem awfully camp today and it wouldn't surprise me if they were similarly dismissed by most folks back in the day . Apart from the drug theme , I got a kick out of how newspaper reporter Art Brighton ( Arthur Gardner ) simply walked into a confectionery shop and hired himself as a soda jerk on the spot . Then there's the favorite everyone seems to respond to on this board , Fern Emmett as the town gossip who just can't quit . I've only seen her in one other picture , 1943's " Dead Men Walk " , and wouldn't you know it , she was the local busy body in that one too ! That scooter complemented her character rather nicely , don't you think . As for the main character Joan Barry ( Luana Walters ) , could they have made her any more ditzy ? She kept falling into every trap set for her by scheming cousin Linda ( Fay McKenzie ) ; I don't think she needed to puff on anything to get in trouble . At one point , trying to be hip , she exclaims " I have the name , so I'll play the game . Let's make a wild one ! . . . Now what do I do ? " Oh brother . Fans of this type of stuff should be on the look out for the four disc / twenty film DVD pack from Mill Creek Entertainment at a price that makes it a super bargain , especially since it collects a bunch of drug titles under the heading of ' Cult Classics ' . They include the aforementioned " Reefer Madness ' along with other era films with titles like " Marihuana " and " Cocaine Fiends " .
368205	2707735	89823	5.0	" When I was your age , I sucked more blood than a California landlord . "	If , like the female protagonist in " Polish Vampire in Burbank " , you can't get enough of vampire movies , you might as well add this one to your list . But be warned , this ham and cheese fest defies simple classification , as it aims for comic horror and winds up a horrific comedy . To be sure , the simple plot has an original touch . The lead character , vampire Dupah ( Mark Pirro ) , has yet to bite his first victim ; he gets human blood from his father ( Hugh O . Fields ) and oversexed sister Yvonne ( Marya Gant ) on their nightly excursions , and drinks his allotment with a straw from a baggy . Utilizing every double entendre in the book , the film proceeds to follow Dupah's agonizing quest to lose his vampiric virginity . He laments that his fangs may be too small , he worries about his first act of penetration , and wonders if he can " go all the way " . Dupah is encouraged by the skeletal chatter of his older brother Sphincter ( Eddie Deezen ) , even though in life he hated the sight of blood , and met his demise when he couldn't outrun a sunrise , the classic curse of the vampire . There are more unique elements as well ; in a flashback sequence we learn how Sphincter almost had the Holy Ghost beat into him by the Judo for Jesus Girl ( Catharine Wheatley ) . The " Queerwolf " concept ( Paul Farbman ) is probably the best of the film , he was a normal man before " it " happened - but since being bitten by a queer during a full moon , he has trouble keeping his wrist straight . Eventually , Dupah jacks up the courage to bite his new girlfriend Delores Lane ( Lori Sutton ) , and as he completes his mission , his accomplishment is heralded by the strains of the " Rocky " theme . The film , produced on a shoestring by Mark Pirro doing triple duty as actor , writer and director , suffers from poor production values , but hey , it made a half million dollars on a next to nothing budget of twenty five hundred dollars . It makes me wonder what a big budget film with today's technology could accomplish . So , was there anything actually scary about " Polish Vampire " ? Well yes , there's Ernie and Misty ( Steven and Bobbi Dorsch ) doing a Sonny and Cher impression . One last thought , was it just me , or did the skeleton of Dupah in the film's finale look like Michael Jackson ?
368132	2707735	46065	5.0	" Shall I weigh the blastoff synchronizer sir ? "	Similar to the earlier patch job known as " Crash of Moons " , Space Ranger Rocky Jones ( Richard Crane ) assembles his gang here once again to avert a threat to Earth , though not as ominous as the one in the earlier film . Most of the action as it were , takes place on Fornax , a moon of Jupiter . The mystery of the film seems to be how Professor Newton ( Maurice Cass ) believes that the environment on Fornax might be hostile to humans , when eight years earlier an Earth rogue named Cardos exiled himself to the moon to escape his criminal past . There he's been ingratiating himself with Zoravac ( Walter Coy ) , the ruler of Fornax . What gives the film some of it's dubious fun is the extensive use of pseudo scientific jargon . Making a return appearance are the viseograph and the astrophone , but perhaps most impressive was the mechanical canary used to test the atmosphere on Fornax ; too bad they didn't come up with a more colorful handle for it . This time around , Rocky's young ward Bobby ( Robert Lyden ) is given a playmate , the daughter of Zoravac named Volaca . As expected , the pair wind up in places they don't belong , but manage to help Rocky and Winky ( Scotty Beckett ) save the day and the millennium . Once again , Winky has the film's most memorable line - " Well rattle my rocket reflexes " . Though uncredited in the film , bad guy Cardos is portrayed by Nestor Paiva . You might recognize him as the Amazon boat captain Lucas from a couple of the " Creature of the Black Lagoon " movies . Like it's predecessor " Crash of Moons " , this film is a fun diversion , even if just to get a view of how far we've come in both space technology and film making . I got a bit of a chuckle out of the mention of an interplanetary agency called the ' Office of Space Affairs ' . Had it still been around for the launch of the Star Ship Enterprise , they might have been kept real busy investigating Captain Kirk .
368282	2707735	28667	5.0	" Confound it Drummond , how is it that whenever I see you someone has either been murdered or disappeared . "	In this entry in the Bulldog Drummond franchise , the Captain ( John Howard ) finds himself on the trail of a pair of villains who have kidnapped his fiancée Phyllis Clavering ( Louise Campbell ) . What makes the story interesting are the written and audible clues that Irena Soldanis ( Helen Freeman ) and her brother-in-law Mikhail Valdin ( J . Carrol Naish ) leave for the detective . The motive behind the kidnapping hearkens back to a murder trial that sent Irena's husband to the gallows , courtesy of Drummond . " Bulldog Drummond Comes Back " seems to be a follow up to the same year's " Bulldog Drummond Escapes " . In that film , the running gag had Drummond's sidekick Algy ( Reginald Denny ) fretting over the birth of his first son ; this time out , Algy is worried about making the christening . Scotland Yard's Colonel Neilson is portrayed by the venerable John Barrymore this time around , and as befits his reputation , is actually top billed above the film's lead character . He earns it though , with a repertoire of disguises necessitated by the villains ' threat to kill Miss Clavering if Scotland Yard gets involved . But in this , my third viewing of a Bulldog Drummond movie , the scene stealer is once again Drummond's butler Tenny ( E . E . Clive ) , who's deadpan repartee and mannerisms make for beautifully understated comic relief . He's also a bit more adventurous this time out , inviting himself along as Drummond and Algy take after the bad guys . It's interesting to note that it was Tenny who figured out one of the clues to be the old disappearing ink trick . Note the scene in which Tenny hitches a ride on the back of the car which shanghais Drummond outside the Anglers Rest . Tenny looks into the rear window of the vehicle , and clearly visible inside is the back of a person's head . However inside the auto , Miss Soldanis and the kidnapped Miss Clavering are in the back seat , but with a shade pulled down over the window ! I've seen J . Carrol Naish now in a number of films , and he looks different every time out . Here , as the creepy villain Valdin he looks almost Oriental in appearance , in a characterization that would have done Peter Lorre proud . Before the mystery is over , Drummond , Algy and Phyllis must escape a death trap before succumbing to lethal gas . Ever the enterprising butler , Tenny makes use of a Scotland Yard auto to remove a fallen tree from the road and arrive just in time to make the save . One thing though , can you really shoot the pin out of a door hinge with a handgun ? If you can overlook some of the less plausible elements in this and other films in the Drummond series , they're worth the effort in entertainment value . I'm still waiting though to see if Captain Drummond ever winds up at the altar ; in both " Escapes " and " Comes Back " he winds up still single at the end of the film .
367881	2707735	30159	5.0	" Don't worry boys , we'll split all the medals three ways . "	The draw for this picture would presumably be the character of Wild Bill Hickok , but when all is said and done , the story plays out pretty much like any of hundreds of ' B ' programmers from the Thirties and Forties . George Houston presents a fairly rugged and good looking portrayal of the title character and it's pretty much his picture all the way . Al ( Fuzzy ) St . John is Wild Bill's sidekick , Whiney Roberts , and I have to give some writer credit here ; Whiney does seem to be a cross between a fox terrier and a jackrabbit . The story itself is a fairly standard and typical one for an old Western . Cattle rustlers are stealing large herds and disposing of lawmen sent to investigate , so Wild Bill is called upon to lend his Civil War buddy Steve Norris ( Dave O'Brien ) a hand when his own herd goes missing . When you get right down to it , you have to wonder why Wild Bill was given a nominal partner for this one ; Fuzzy doesn't have much to do here except watch Bill go one on one with the bad guys . At least he's comical to watch . I guess I shouldn't be , but I'm usually surprised to hear how black characters were treated in these old films . There's a party scene at the Norris home where Hickok calls over the black family butler , saying ' Oh , come here boy " . It's a rather innocuous line , but Mantan Moreland is such a great character actor that he's able to brush it off easily enough . I would have liked to see more of him in the picture , but he was only around for a few minutes . That didn't stop him though , from getting in the film's best line in a funny scene with Fuzzy . Neither of them can read , but Moreland has a unique explanation for why he can't read a hand written note - " I can read readin ' , but I can't read writin ' . " You know , I thought about that for a while , and it almost made sense !
368197	2707735	33390	5.0	" Am I dreamin ' or who am I ? "	I've never seen a Western before where the hero and his sidekick pals start out in jail ! It turns out to be a set up for the good guys getting sprung by a trio of look alike outlaws . Billy the Kid ( Buster Crabbe ) and his partners , Fuzzy ( Fuzzy St . John ) and Jeff Walker ( Bud McTaggart ) spend the rest of the picture attempting to get the goods on Mesa City town boss Stanton ( Glenn Strange ) and his gang of henchmen . It's actually a pretty creative idea that Stanton's gimmick is providing protection for outlaws in Mesa City with the help of a crooked town judge ( Milt Kibbee ) . Beyond that , what you have is a fairly standard ' B ' Western shoot ' em up , complete with a pretty female ( Anne Jeffreys ) who eyes up The Kid , but the hint of a romance is never really brought to the fore . " Billy The Kid Trapped " is the third in a series of films Buster Crabbe did for Producers Releasing Corporation in the early 1940's . Later on , because of it's negative connotation , the name of Crabbe's character was changed to Bill Carson . However even in his Billy the Kid stories , Crabbe was never portrayed as a bad guy , rather as a hero wrongfully accused of a crime . As for Anne Jeffreys , she appears in the story as a blond , and looking nothing like the character she portrayed in the Topper TV series of the mid 1950's . I just took a quick look at her stats on IMDb and nearly jumped out of my seat to learn that she's still alive ! , and will be appearing in a movie to be released this year ! ! ! Holy cow , maybe she really is the ghost of Marion Kerby ! Keep a keen eye on Fuzzy in the picture and you might catch the only time you'll ever see a bearded sidekick actually spit a chaw in the face of a bad guy ! Fuzzy had quite the staying power of a loyal pardner , and his career at PRC took him through a host of saddle pals , beginning with Bob Steele in the Billy the Kid series , followed by the stint with Buster Crabbe . Later , he teamed with George Houston and Bob Livingston in the Lone Rider pictures , and then a new PRC series with Lash LaRue . Closing out with a bit of trivia - Buster Crabbe rode a palomino in the Billy the Kid series , even though the horse appeared white . The horse's name was Falcon .
368306	2707735	29951	5.0	" Pardon me Sir , but these are not guns , these are pistols . "	The movie opens with a trouser less Drummond ( John Howard ) and his butler Tenny ( E . E . Clive ) , confined to Rockingham Lodge on the eve of the Captain's wedding to Miss Phyllis Clavering ( Heather Angel ) . Drummond's sidekick Algy ( Reginald Denny ) is holding their pants hostage to prevent his boss from getting caught up in a distraction that would disrupt the ceremony . Is it possible that they only had one pair of pants each ? Scotland Yard's Colonel Nielson ( H . B . Warner ) meanwhile , is about to be taken hostage himself by an old nemesis , Richard Lane ( J . Carrol Naish ) . Lane hopes to secure information about a newly developed radio-wave disintegrator , but when Nielson becomes uncooperative , Lane hustles him aboard a plane bound for Morocco where he'll have time to work him over for the secret . The early going is marked by a frantic effort to catch Lane and Nielson , as Algy valiantly tries to deliver the pants along the way . The ever patient and ever single Miss Clavering stows away aboard Drummond's plane as the good guys take flight to Africa . The final confrontation there involves a lion , strategically tethered to an uncertain stake with Colonel Nielson the prize should it give way . " Bulldog Drummond in Africa " offers it's share of characteristic good humor and camaraderie between Drummond and his cohorts , though this time around some troubling elements are included as well . Nielson's butler Phillips is dispatched by Lane , and Algy takes a bullet in the arm during the finale at Lane's estate . For J . Carrol Naish , this was his second unsuccessful attempt to outwit hero Drummond . He previously vied with John Howard in " Bulldog Drummond Comes Back " , though portraying a different character . Heather Angel reprises her role as Phyllis Clavering from " Bulldog Drummond Escapes " , the only film in the series with Ray Milland in the role of the title character . Howard and Angel would team up a total of four times , culminating in the 1939 entry " Bulldog Drummond's Bride " . Not having seen it yet , I've got my fingers crossed for an invitation to a wedding .
368232	2707735	29801	5.0	" Heap Big Show To-Morrow "	For an early Gene Autry Western , this one has a few interesting hooks to keep you entertained , chief among them the location in that far off western state of Georgia . I imagine it was necessary to pull off the premise of the title , since the story dealt with a community of ' turpentiners ' who made their living off the by-products of the local pine forests . It set up a type of range feud between encroaching ranchers who needed more grazing space for their cattle , pitting them against the turpentiners , who relied on the forest for their livelihood . Autry gets caught in the middle trying to do the right thing by both sides , and winds up becoming alienated from both . It's the only picture I can remember where any Western hero of note ( Autry , Rogers , Hoppy , etc . ) actually had a father in the story . I don't think I've ever seen Smiley Burnette looking as young before in a movie , to the point of being almost unrecognizable behind the mustache and meager girth . However when he lets out with the frog voice , there's no mistaking him . Ever the con man , Colonel Millhouse ( Burnette ) does some quick thinking on his feet when he declares a runaway team of horses a publicity stunt to help promote his Wild West Show . There's a nominal love interest for Gene's character in the person of young Milly ( Betty Bronson ) , who has an earnest crush on Gene and pines for him when he goes away to establish his career as a world champion cowboy ( sorry , couldn't resist the pun ) . That sets up the ensuing action when Gene returns to Pine Ridge as the star of the Millhouse extravaganza . The story moves along at a pretty rapid gallop , and you'll see some exciting horseback footage featuring Gene and the bad guys . I didn't see it as all that necessary to speed up some of the action footage the way director Joseph Kane did , for me it was a little distracting . Say , you know , I was curious about one thing - when Gene was late for his act in the Millhouse show , the Colonel threw in a ringer to impersonate him , but where did the Autry impersonator find a Champion impersonator ?
367895	2707735	43046	5.0	" You ever been to a necktie party ? "	This one starts with a fairly serious if not standard premise ; if the new railroad train can make it to the town of Tomahawk , Colorado by the prescribed time , they'll win a subsidy that gives the rail line an advantage over the local stagecoach outfit . Unfortunately , the film devolves into virtual farce by the last half hour , as a reluctant engineer ( Walter Brennan ) is faced with the necessity of taking his train apart ! in order to make it to the finish line . Which wound up being even more ludicrous than the team of horses it took to pull the engine and three additional railroad cars over forty miles of wilderness devoid of train tracks . If any of this was even remotely believable it would have made for an interesting story , but as it is , the picture is best viewed strictly for light entertainment . The surprising thing for me winds up being how this 1950 color picture previewed a couple of classic black and white TV Westerns down the road . In not too much of a stretch , Anne Baxter's character is turned into Annie Oakley for the 1954 series , the sharp shooting cowgirl who gained fame in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show of the late 1800's . And with Richard Sale writing and directing , there's no question that the Chief Yowlachie character was the basis for Yancy Derringer's sidekick and bodyguard Pahoo KaTeWah . The Chief used hand gestures to speak and portrayed the same stance and attitude as Pahoo , while using a tomahawk instead of a dagger . Need any more convincing ? - his name was Pawnee , the same tribe that Pahoo came from . This was my first look at Dan Dailey in any kind of role , and he coyly plays off of the female Kit Dodge ( Baxter ) in an amusing manner , particularly in that ' bussing ' routine . Lending support to the unconvincing dynamics of the story was his unique ability to participate in a perfectly choreographed song and dance routine with Madame Adelaide's girls , complete with his own props ! You know , one of the Madame's dancing girls looked just like a young Marilyn Monroe ! But geez , couldn't they get someone more authentic to play the role of Crooked Knife ? So I check the credits , and that's none other than the original screen Tonto , Chief Thundercloud , not even attempting some phony Indian dialect . What a let down , and not even upset that the railroad hands wiped out half of his war party ! At least the story had a neat twist finale when the Mayor of Tomahawk expanded the city limits to allow the train to achieve it's goal and ' win ' against all the obstacles thrown it's way . But good grief , what was that farewell between Kit Dodge and Johnny Behind the Deuces all about when her five ' kids ' joined to wave goodbye . Somewhere along the way Grandpa Dodge's birds and bees talk wound up being a mere afterthought .
368334	2707735	34064	5.0	" You know , you're a lot better man than you even think you are . "	Once again , a boxing milieu provides the backdrop to an East Side Kids film , as the boys initially make their way to a Civilian Conservation Corps camp under Danny's ( Bobby Jordan ) pretext of finding a training camp for Muggs ( Leo Gorcey ) . Muggs ' character follows the pattern of starting out as a street wise tough guy only to soften up when he comes to realize the world isn't out to get him . Along the way he manages to stage a few boxing scenes with various opponents , and interestingly , he doesn't actually win any of them . When I used to watch these flicks as a kid back in the 1950's I recall how frustrated I would get about the lack of character continuity from story to story . For example , in this picture , Scruno isn't a member of the East Siders , he's already at the CCC camp as a worker . Apart from the single demeaning chore of bringing in the boys ' gear , this film doesn't get into the rather common practice of providing racial stereotypes . The set ups in the film almost always center on Muggs ' character , and they never really get beyond simplistic . However I can see how young audiences of the era would be captivated by Muggs ' traits of loyalty to his friends and willingness to work things out for himself in a jam ; not squealing on a guy who might have gotten him into a mess was a plus . Even when he gets booed for bad sportsmanship in the first camp fight , you get the feeling there will be redemption on the horizon for this Vassey Street bad boy . As for the boxing scenes , there's not much to see in the un-choreographed action , which gets sloppy with pushing and shoving , and virtually no emphasis on technical pugilism . For some reason , those scenes were generally sped up adding even more to the unrealistic feel of the fights . Ultimately though it doesn't matter much , as the boys come through showing what they're made of , and that's usually a pretty good reason to cheer . Fans of the East Side Kids who want to sample more of the boxing adventures might try looking up " Bowery Blitzkrieg " and " Kid Dynamite " .
367827	2707735	43007	5.0	" Oh , no tellin ' what'll disappear next , maybe one of us ! "	By the time " Streets of Ghost Town " came out , Columbia was using more and more stock footage to keep expenses down , and it's quite evident here , particularly in those scenes with the voice over narration by Charles Starrett . The film also chews up a lot of time with endless back and forth riders on horseback and it's share of stampeding cattle . But for young matinée movie fans of the 1940's and ' 50's , this was the kind of action that kept all the young fans happy , both boys AND girls . I was intrigued by the location of the story , near Border Plain and the wild country of The Spur . That sounds really cool , but I wonder if there really is such a place ; Google gives you over a million hits , and I don't have that much time . With the ghost town theme , I thought the picture would get a little more mileage out of Smiley Burnette reacting to ghostly phenomena , but there was only that single Donner appearance in the window , and not too scary at that . As for Smiley , he only gets to do one musical number in the picture instead of his usual three or four , in fact the first is done by Ozie Waters and his Colorado Rangers . Then there's that curiously named boy actor , Little Brown Jug as Tommy Donner ; I really need to get to the bottom of that nickname . His real name , Don Reynolds is credited here , but I've seen pictures that list him only as Little Brown Jug . If you're a big time Durango Kid fan , you might think you've seen this picture before , there was a 1946 Durango film titled " Landrush " , also taking place in ' The Spur ' , and having similar elements , right down to digging trenches to fight the fires set by the villains . My guess is that if you watched them back to back , the land rush scenes from the earlier film are recycled here . As far as other ' B ' Westerns offering a ' ghostly ' theme , I would recommend Lash Larue's " Ghost Town Renegades " from 1947 , where the comedy antics are handled by Fuzzy St . John .
368475	2707735	44796	5.0	" People pay good money to see me get hurt . . . "	Probably one's only interest in seeing this movie would be to catch Leonard Nimoy in his first starring role , no mean feat as the actor had only two prior roles in film , one of them uncredited . The story itself is entirely uneven , and one is kept constantly off balance as to what Paul Baroni's ( Nimoy ) intention and motivations are . I had to do a double take as the opening credit introductions rolled , and we learn about the ' Billy Goat ' gang , of which Baroni and his pal Angelo are members of . There's not one shred of difference between Angelo and the Daily Planet's Jimmy Olsen , as portrayed by Jack Larson . As for the gang itself , they looked like they could mop up 106th Street and 3rd Avenue with the Dead End Kids , even with Leo Gorcey at the helm . I guess my main problem with the story is that there's never any real compelling reason for the decisions Baroni makes . For example , what was behind his desire to sing in the church choir , thereby alienating himself from the rest of the ' goats ' ? How does one run away from almost killing a priest , only to turn up in the headlines of the local sport pages - couldn't the authorities make a connection ? And above all , how do you double cross the bookmakers and then get to do it again with even bigger money riding on the outcome ? Which by the way , got the biggest ho hum reaction from a trio of losers I'd ever seen after dropping twenty grand . If only Mr . Spock could have foretold his future stardom he might well have passed on this groaner , but then again , who's to know - one has to start somewhere . Still , the first time you see Nimoy straight on with that goofy make up job of a nose you'll double over . Did anyone else get the impression that it was about to fall off ? I'm impressed though , that two Star Trek alumni got their start by actually starring in full length film roles . The other would be DeForrest Kelley , who did the same in a somewhat better picture , a psychological thriller called " Fear in the Night " from 1947 .
367998	2707735	27420	5.0	" Well there she is - Sofio - jumpin ' off place for the scum of the South Seas . "	With a name like " Captain Calamity " , I was surprised coming out of the film at how entertaining it actually was . George Houston portrays the title character , Captain Bill Jones , who gets a lot of mileage out of a single gold doubloon . Without ever actually lying about discovering a sunken treasure , Jones ' tall tale takes on a life of it's own after the seed has been planted with a nefarious saloon keeper named Joblin ( Harold Howard ) . After that , the treasure grows with each telling of the tale , until one imagines the Schooner Marigold sinking under it's weight . To be sure , the film is not an award winner , but it is a fun adventure . George Houston , who I'd seen before in some of his Lone Rider Westerns , is much more spirited here , as he performs a host of singing numbers while grinning broadly . You never quite believe he's going to turn over his leading lady Marian Nixon to a former beau after all the commotion over the non existent gold . The best lines of the film are delivered by Captain Jones as he re-establishes his acquaintance with Joblin henchman Black Pierre . During introductions , Jones remarks - " You know of all the guys I don't like , you're the one I like most " . Later in the film Jones reaffirms his mutual trust and distrust of Pierre at the same time - " I'd be quicker to believe you than any other liar I know . . . " Besides Marian Nixon's character Madge Lewis , the film is complemented by Margaret Irving as a conniving Madame Gruen in league with the film's bad guys , and a pretty island girl named Annana . I got a kick out of her screen credit , reminiscent of one for a character in the 1970's TV series ' Hawaii Five-O " . In that one you had Zulu as ' Kono ' , and here we have Movita as ' Annana ' . My question in each case - Why couldn't they have just used their own names ? As mentioned earlier , George Houston went on to do eleven films for Producers Releasing Corporation ( PRC ) in the period 1940-1942 as ' The Lone Rider ' . Though I haven't seen any of those in which he sings , he does belt out the Lone Rider theme song over that series ' opening credits . Houston's voice was by some estimates just a bit too formal and booming for lowly ' B ' Westerns , but in ' Calamity ' , he does sound pretty good ; that salt sea air does wonders . As time goes by , little known titles like " Captain Calamity " seem to be finding a wider audience with assorted compilations . I found it as part of a ten film , three DVD ' Pirates ' set recently released by St . Clair Vision , which has also put together similar collections in other genres . It's a terrific way to spend a few hours at a very reasonable price ( under ten dollars ) , and get to see a lot of actors before they became big name Hollywood stars .
368047	2707735	42311	5.0	" Speak or you die , where is She-Devil ? "	If you watch enough of the Jungle Jim movies , you'll realize that the stories all follow a pretty standard formula , just as Charles Starrett's Durango Kid films did in the Western genre . Which is OK on the one hand because they're entertaining in their way , but it also makes them highly forgettable once a couple of days have passed by . What's kind of interesting in this one is that Johnny Weismuller as the jungle hero is pitted against Buster Crabbe as the villain of the piece . Since both were genuine Olympic swimming champions , the stage might have been set for some sort of athletic rivalry , however since it was Weismuller's franchise , he's the only one we see doing the high dives and underwater heroics , this time against a crocodile . Central to the story is the rumored Wild Girl of Lake Pakongee , raised in the jungle and accompanied by a tiger . Her parents were murdered years earlier by the evil witch doctor Hakim , and it's Hakim's goal to kill her as well , before she can exact revenge . Interestingly , the actress portraying the Wild Girl , Anita Lhoest , appeared on screen only one time , and this was it . She too was an exceptional swimmer from California . As in all the Jungle Jim films , wild animals take center stage from time to time , but with budgets as they were back in the day , it's not too hard to pick out that monkey treetop scramble that appeared as stock footage in the prior two films ( " The Lost Tribe " and " Mark Of The Gorilla " ) . What makes this picture fun at the finale is the wild monkey rampage that overtakes the witch doctor and his tribal goons . For those keeping track , the non African animal appearing in the story this time , besides Wild Girl Joan's tiger , is a South American cockatoo . Say , if you stay attentive , there are a couple of interesting items to stay alert for . Right after Chief Mahala ( Rick Vallin ) banishes Hakim from the tribal village , there's a shot of Wild Girl up on a rock ledge , just as in the start of the picture . If you look closely , you'll note that the waterfall to her left is in reverse , it's rising instead of falling ! Later on in the story , listen closely and you'll hear a faint Tarzan yell during the panther / tiger scuffle . That was Weismuller's classic signature that he invented for his earlier Tarzan role . For me , I guess that's where the fun is in these Jungle Jim pictures , trying to pick up on the little idiosyncrasies thrown in by the director to make things interesting . Moving forward , we'll have to see if Tamba the Chimp becomes a regular as one of Jungle Jim's animal companions . He made fast friends with Jim's dog Skipper by trading a bone for a banana in the early filler part of the movie . Good thing too , or Jim and company would have never made it across the ravine !
367661	2707735	69057	5.0	" Gringos , come surrender ! "	Finally , the mystery solved as to how Telly Savalas became bald ! Starting out , " Pancho Villa " appears to be a serious treatment of the Mexican revolutionary's legend , but it quickly dissolves into a farcical comedy Western . Things get under way somewhat tentatively with Colonel Wilcox ' ( Chuck Connors ) ' fly in the mess hall scene ' , quickly followed by Villa trading a horse for Miss Clara's tin lizzy . By the time Villa feigns being dead , I realized for sure that this one was intended to be an over the top flick , with Savalas going over the top more than once . Without even knowing anything about the historical Pancho Villa , I'm sure this film had nothing remotely to do with him . It's always neat though , to see legendary TV Western personalities make a comeback , in this case , both ' Rifleman's ' Connors , and Cheyenne Bodie himself , Clint Walker . Walker portrays Villa's American sidekick , though it's never made clear why he sides with the Mexicans . A full decade following the end of the ' Cheyenne ' series , he looks as good as ever , but it's a mystery why he's in that seafaring get up , though it makes as much sense in it's way as the rest of the film . Even Anne Francis makes an appearance as Scotty's ( Walker ) ex-wife , giving further star power to this revolutionary tale . Others on this board have mentioned that train crash scene with some enthusiasm , so I'm not sure if the print I viewed was edited in some way . It appeared to me that once the locomotives made contact with each other the action froze and then we see the aftermath . Why not just show the whole wreck take place , unless it was to save those great antiques for real . Best line of the film - " He don't need a doctor , he needs a change of underwear " , as a doctor removes a lizard from Pancho's shirt while he appears to be dying from some sort of convulsion . But the one each of the principals had to be thinking by the end of the story - " You know , if I was you , I'd jump off this train " .
368369	2707735	40778	5.0	" Sometimes muddy waters when stirred sufficiently bring strange things to surface . "	Forged fingerprints in a Charlie Chan film were used as recently as 1946 in " Dark Alibi " , six movies prior to " The Shanghai Chest " . The same gimmick is used here again , this time with the fingerprints of a man who's been dead for six months . The prints are found at the scene of three murders , all of the victims having had some connection to the man who was sentenced to death for murder himself . But that may have been a frame up ; the man , Tony Pandello may in fact have been innocent , and someone is out for vengeance . Roland Winters portrays Inspector Charlie Chan in this 1948 Monogram release . Continuity in the later Monogram films seems to have fallen apart completely , as Victor Sen Yung appears as Number # 2 Son Tommy , contrary to his introduction in earlier 20th Century Fox and Monogram movies as Number # 2 Son Jimmy . Mantan Moreland is Chan chauffeur Birmingham Brown . In a jail scene , Birmingham and Tommy are released from the lock up , and in the next cell is Willie Best , appearing under his own name . Willie appeared in the Chan film " Red Dragon " as Birmingham's cousin Chattanooga Brown . In typical Chan fashion , the murderer revealed at the end is a surprise , having been a trusted aide of the first murder victim . But the case is wrapped up neatly by Charlie ; he outwits the villain , who did all of his dirty work in the dark of night in garb reminiscent of The Shadow .
367954	2707735	43982	6.0	" Get out of there , or I'll fill you full o ' lead " .	When one of Rocky Lane's courier buddies is shot and killed , the cowboy hero heads off to the town of Durango to help avenge his friend and get the goods on the bad guys who are looting local wagon trains and creating general havoc . It's true as another reviewer points out , that the town of Durango is never mentioned by name , however one of the local businesses names the town in the latter part of the movie . In the main plot of the story , local ranchers must wait a week for a forty thousand dollar payload to arrive in town in order to make their mortgage payments , and my timing in watching the film had me chuckling each time Sheriff Walters ( Ross Ford ) reassured the ranchers with " The money will be here in time " . It was like listening to a bunch of hot shot bankers who created the sub prime mortgage mess telling us that everything was really OK , until of course , it wasn't . Here's something to think about - when Rocky arrived in town and filled Sheriff Walters in on how his money pouch was stolen , they watch as Cricket Adams ( Walter Baldwin ) goes into a store across the street from the jail . The sheriff states that they could go out to Cricket's farm to look for the strongbox that the outlaws probably hid there . However Rocky was a stranger to Durango and didn't know any of it's residents , while the sheriff couldn't know Rocky was referring to Cricket's farm . Lucky guess ? - I don't think so . Or how about Rocky sliding across the dirt to escape a bad guy bullet at Cricket's farm ? When he gets up , his shirt isn't even dusty ! Now there's a super power I didn't know cowboys had . And say , wasn't that an awful big ranch house old Cricket had for a corn farmer ? I guess that's what makes a lot of these old ' B ' oaters so entertaining , even when a lot of thought wasn't put into the story line . What you need to do is concentrate on the cowboy hero , and in this one , Rocky's always well poised with his manner and his fists . I especially enjoyed his wild brawl with villain Blake ( Steve Darrell ) in the local saloon , making great use of breakaway props and furniture , along with that great rescue aboard Black Jack when Cricket's buckboard took off in an early scene . Also gratifying to see that the story's hero passes on making a play for the rancher's niece ( Aline Towne ) , deferring to the sheriff instead . Makes it a whole lot easier to move along at the end of the story .
367938	2707735	39157	6.0	" You better get those silver bullets ready for those ghosts because we're going in . "	Even with a fuzzy washed out print and voices out of sync with lip movements , " Apache Rose " is a fun Western in an uncharacteristic setting . Gabby , Andy and Smiley must have been unavailable because Roy Rogers ' sidekick here is Olin Howlin who I haven't seen before . As expected , he provides some of the film's comic relief as Alkali , the old timer with tall tales and a case of the dizzies whenever trouble's close by , which is pretty often . Dale Evans is on hand as Billie Colby , the owner of a tugboat , the " Apache Rose " . Just like her character in " Bells of San Angelo " , she and Roy start out at odds with each other , but eventually team up together to bring down a villainous plot to seize the oil rights from rancher Carlos Vega ( Russ Vincent ) . The lead bad guy is Reed Calhoun ( George Meeker ) , owner of a casino boat who's maneuvered Vega into running up a large gambling debt so he can get his hands on Vega's oil rights . I always get a kick out of seeing Pat Brady in a Rogers ' film before he became a mainstay in the TV series . Here he's involved in a Mexican hat dance with a senorita , and leads the charge with a battering ram to break Roy and Alkali out of a wine cellar . When you stop to think about some of the plot elements offered here , the film winds up being a bit silly . Men in business suits for example , operate out of a cave near the ocean . Near the end of the story , bad guy Calhoun grabs Carlos as a hostage with about two dozen of his ranch hands as witnesses , and when the villains find themselves on the short end of a shootout with Roy and the sheriff , they attempt a getaway with rowboats into the ocean . Not a very smart move with the tide rolling in ! As expected , there are a few musical numbers , and Dale gets to do a solo on her tugboat - ' There's Nothing ' Like Coffee in the Morning ' . The romantic angle between her character Billie with Roy and Vega isn't adequately resolved by film's end , though all signs point to her getting together with Roy . If you can get past some of the weaker points of the film , you can have a good time with " Apache Rose " . Dale Evans is a treat , and gets to share about as much screen time as future husband Roy .
368489	2707735	63459	6.0	" I don't know what I've got , but I'm about to share it " .	Abbott and Costello may have wreaked havoc on more branches of the military , but they never tangled with two at the same time the way Bob Hope does in " The Private Navy of Sgt . O'Farrell " . A somewhat uneven comedy , the film makes do with Hope's traditional one liners and does the best it can with a supporting cast that includes Jeffrey Hunter , Phyllis Diller , and Gina Lollabrigida . At the center of the story is Sgt . O'Farrell's ( Hope ) plan to bring women and beer to the island base of Camp Funapee . Once accomplished with mixed results , the story meanders off to allow Hope's character to capture a Japanese submarine single handedly , and close out the story arm in arm with the lovely Maria ( Lollabrigida ) . As for the beer , I was surprised to see that it wasn't Budweiser cans floating all over the Pacific , but those of then heavyweight Milwaukee competitor - Pabst Blue Ribbon . It made me wonder if the Anheuser-Busch folks might have been given a shot at the picture . By the time the film really gets rolling , there's a can of Pabst in just about every scene . Being a long time Bob Hope fan , I can't recall today if Pabst was ever a major sponsor of his programming . But I sure do remember Texaco . Hey , did you catch the nod to one of Hope's earlier pictures ? All the men are on the beach drinking when the Indian private says to Hope - " Excuse me Heap Big Paleface ? " There's also that funny sequence attempting to reenact the beach scene in " From Here to Eternity " ; Hope even throws Lancaster's name out there in a bit of self deprecation . Also , if you were waiting to see if Crosby would show up , there's that clip of " Pennies From Heaven " to keep the streak going . Yet even with all the typical Bob Hope humor , he seems just a bit out of place in this late 1960's flick pretending to be one from the 1940's . This one approached the beach blanket bingo genre just a little too close for my comfort , and I prefer virtually any of his earlier efforts in glorious black and white . For my money , if I'm looking for Hope in a military setting , I'd just as soon tune in to one of his many USO entertainment specials . If memory serves , one of them would also have showcased Gina Lollabrigida and Phyllis Diller .
368330	2707735	27707	6.0	" Watch her wiggle , watch her shake , and don't forget to watch that snake ! "	The story synopsis for this film on Encore Westerns stated that after being framed for murder , Gene Autry goes on a search for the real killers . I was wondering if he'd have better luck than OJ , so I tuned in to check it out . Actually , I knew he would , since Autry always gets his man , whether in the movies or on his TV show . This was an early Autry Western for Republic Pictures , utilizing a plot element I haven't seen before . Chief villain Morgan ( J . P . McGowan ) and his top henchman Conners ( Tom London ) attempt to run an infected herd with ' Texas cattle fever ' from Sage County across Colima County , where a quarantine is in effect . Autry's first brush with the bad guys occurs when he saves the sheriff's daughter ( Dorothy Dix ) from the gang . I got a kick out of that gun shot Autry used to knock the hat off Conners ; directly behind Conners were three of his men on horseback and not one of them or their horses were hit ! You know , there's a fair amount of entertainment in this picture for one that comes in just under an hour . Smiley does his usual thing with a colorful tune , and black character Eightball ( Eugene Jackson ) does a neat tap dance . My favorite was the way Dr . Parker ( Earl Hodgins ) discredited the phony vet with his quick delivery on matters of veterinary medicine . Maybe it was another rider , but I would swear that was Gene and Champion that took a tumble during the chase after the bad guys near the finale . If I'm wrong , someone give me a heads up . You know , I was just as curious as the town folk about that five o'clock deadline Connors gave Gene to get out of town . But somehow , it just didn't have the suspense of " High Noon " .
367846	2707735	47320	6.0	" Too late for a doctor , this boy's a fixin ' to die . "	Sorry I can't share the same enthusiasm for this film that prior reviewers have , but it seems to muddle from scene to scene in search of the righteous revenge angle that never quite materializes . The protagonist , Jet Cosgrave ( John Derek ) , never evokes the kind of sympathy one would expect for his cause , because even though he was swindled out of ownership of his father's ranch , he only seems one track minded on doing away with his uncle The Major ( Jim Davis ) . Along the way , he can't seem to keep his hands off the ladies , and I get the impression that if Mrs . Banner was a little younger , he might have tried to kiss her too . I guess where I lost empathy for Jet was when he failed to deal with his hired gun Dude Rankin ( Bob Steele ) for the shooting of the camp cook at the line ranch . It was almost like , ' well that wasn't a cool thing to do , but a purpose was served so we'll let it slide ' . Check the scene right after Jet admonishes Rankin , saying he's to do what he's paid for and not more ; as Jet turns his horse to ride away , the horse hits Rankin in the head ! I was surprised that wasn't a do over . You know what perplexed me - the showdown that I expected to occur between Jet and the Major the first time was interrupted by the love triangle , and the Major didn't do anything but hang out waiting for something to happen . Not very believable when he was already worked up enough to face off against his nephew . Then when it was set up again , attorney Devlin interfered to prevent a more satisfying resolution . In their own way , the only characters that seemed to maintain their integrity as bad boys were the gun for hire ranch bosses , Cal Prince ( James Millican ) and Dude Rankin . Oh yeah , and kudos to Curly too for remaining true to his principles and not selling out his boss ; what else would you expect from an actor named Nacho Galindo ? At least there was that cool fist fight on horseback between Jet and The Dude , I've never seen that before . Just about everything else though was pretty much by the book for a ' B ' oater . For a better John Derek effort in a Western , I would recommend checking out the 1957 picture , " Fury at Showdown " . It's got better atmosphere as a black and white film , a great bar room brawl , and an effective early appearance by Nick Adams .

The bad news would be that this was the first one , meaning that all the rest went downhill from here . Now don't get me wrong , I'm a ' B ' Western fan from way back , but if you get a chance to view any of these , you'll have to take them with a good ole boy grain of nostalgia and an appreciation for simpler times . Actually , " Rider of Destiny " might have been the better title , since it's Wayne's show all the way . He portrays Singin ' Sandy Saunders and has a reputation as the most notorious gunman since Billy the Kid . That's somewhat ironic though , since it's later revealed that he's a special Secret Service agent sent from Washington to investigate a land swindle scheme under the direction of town boss James Kincaid ( Forrest Taylor ) . How would he have earned that nickname having just arrived ? Some other bits don't quite jive as well , like Saunders ' finesse with a six gun . In the only actual one on one showdown with a villain that I can recall in a Lone Star , Saunders neatly places a bullet in each wrist of Slip Morgan ( Earl Dwire ) , thereby making him a threat no more to righteous folks . One wonders how he might have learned to shoot like that . But you know what . It doesn't make too much of a difference , because if you're a fan of these oaters , you'll have a blast with this one as much as all the rest . You've got your crazy horse spills , wild stage coach rides , and villainous intrigue to pull it all together . You also have your obligatory romantic leading lady , here portrayed by Cecilia Parker . Her character is Fay Denton , daughter of George ( pre-Gabby ) Hayes , and she signals her interest in Saunders right from the get go . He helps things along by serenading her with a few songs with Daddy present , and boy , they just can't get enough , even if his singing voice is nothing at all like his speaking voice . Yakima Canutt is on hand as an unnamed Kincaid henchman , and of course it's Yak that's responsible for all the daring stunt work , including that trademark ' jump on the horse team and go under the stagecoach ' trick , simply remarkable if you consider the timing and logistics involved . His fellow baddies include a comedic pair of stage drivers also working for Kincaid , Bert and Elmer ( Al St . John and Heinie Conklin ) . It would be a few years before Al becomes ' Fuzzy ' . Modern day viewers might be left scratching their head over a line spoken by Wayne's character early in the film . When he discovers sheriff Bill Baxter wandering in the desert with a bullet wound , he tends him while adding - " I'll have you in Starbucks before night " . A lot has been debated over who the singer was who dubbed Wayne's voice in this movie and " The Man From Utah " . A couple reviewers on this board credit old time band leader and crooner Smith Ballew , although Ballew himself denied it consistently until he passed away . The odds on favorite seems to be Bill Bradbury , son of director Robert North Bradbury , and twin brother of another era cowboy star , Bob Steele . Bill had a fine baritone voice , and used his talent to make some extra money while going to medical school . For anyone who cares to learn more about the controversy , check out the following page - http www b westerns com jwayne1 htm You'll have to scroll down to the bottom part of the page , and it's a good read . Anyway , for old time Western fans , " Riders of Destiny " is as good a place as any to see how John Wayne learned his craft . Hard to believe that by the time he made his breakout film " Stagecoach " to become an overnight success , he already had fifty one movies to his credit ! Only one question remains though while watching ' Riders ' - where were all those geese hanging out when there wasn't any water around ?
368093	2707735	452637	6.0	" There's no swimming after seven . "	It's been three weeks since I saw the film , and I've been thinking about it off and on ever since . I had difficulty at first deciding whether it was a genuinely brilliant exercise in film making , or a contrived piece of self indulgence from Shyamalan himself . I'm ready to side with the latter and call it a wrap . Here's why . In and of itself , the fairy tale bedtime story concept might work on the fly in real life , but here it looks like the movie itself was made up in the same fashion . What would have happened , one might ask , if the box of frosted flakes was on the other side of the oat bran ? Would that have led to a different interpretation ? It struck me watching the film how brazen M . Night stuck it in the face of film critics everywhere with his character Farber , brilliantly portrayed by the way by Bob Balaban . As for creating the mythology about his own self importance as a writer , I was reminded of that ' real men of genius ' beer commercial - ' Nothing says I'm important more than a man shouting I'm important into his cell phone ' . Redeeming qualities - there are a few . Paul Giamatti's performance was once again a pure gem of a portrayal . And lest you believe a one sided bodybuilder is too improbable to be true , there is in fact a real life counterpart to the character of Reggie in the world of sports . Anyone who's seen ' The King and His Court " four man softball team can tell you pitcher Eddie Feigner's right arm is twice the size of his left . So at least that bit of whimsy was credible . In the end , ' Lady ' didn't do it for me , and quite honestly , the only M . Night films that did were " The Sixth Sense " and " Unbreakable " . The 1960's ' Twilight Zone ' TV series had an episode with a cookbook also , but that was made by an alien race with recipes for humans . Now that was an original concept . If Mr . Shyamalan goes back to making thrillers that thrill and suspense films that excite , he won't have to tell us how brilliant it is , I think we'll recognize it .
367892	2707735	50763	6.0	" If we're all playing showdown , I'd like to see the cards when they fall . "	With " Night Passage " , you get Jimmy Stewart uncharacteristically playing an accordion and singing a few songs , and Audie Murphy in another one of his baby face villain roles . You also have Dan Duryea in a co-starring effort , but you have to wonder if he might have been hard of hearing during filming . He shouts every single one of his lines except one , as I was so curious about his over the top manner that I started to keep track . It actually distracted me at times because I kept wondering why he was yelling all the time . I also had to wonder why Jimmy Stewart appeared to be out of breath after his first encounter with villain Concho ( Robert J . Wilke ) while saving young Joey ( Brandon De Wilde ) from a thrashing . At fifty one , perhaps he wasn't in as good shape as he should have been to be riding horses and chasing down bad guys . As for the story , it's fairly formulaic with Stewart and Murphy as brothers on opposite sides of the law , a theme done countless times in Westerns . There's not much new to add here either , and as I've noted earlier , Murphy doesn't have the face to be taken seriously as a villain , the same being true for his portrayal as gunman Gant in the 1959 film " No Name On The Bullet " . Try picturing Roy Rogers as a bad guy . See , it just doesn't work . It was cool to see veteran Jack Elam as part of the Whitey Harbin gang , and whenever I see Hugh Beaumont in a non-Ward Cleaver role I have to wonder what the ' Beav ' is up to . Not a bad film , with some great Colorado scenery on display , but truthfully , the most emotion this got out of me was seeing Grant McLaine's ( Stewart ) accordion go up in flames . That was hard for this Polish boy . Say , here's something to wonder about . As Miss Charlotte ( Dianne Foster ) pines for The Utica Kid ( Murphy ) throughout the film , and she finally gets to hear that he wants to marry her , why isn't she all torn up with the way the gun battle plays out ? And brother Grant just moves right in ? Ready for another good brother / bad brother match up with a railroad theme ? Try 1949's " The Last Bandit " with Wild Bill Elliott and Forrest Tucker . No accordions in that one though , you'll have to hum .
367639	2707735	60261	6.0	" There can be no haste before the eternity of death . "	Knowing that a hellbender is actually a large type of salamander , I was weirdly surprised to see that the flag draped coffin bore a likeness of a salamander on it . The Hellbenders were a Confederate outfit in the film , with leader Jonas ( Joseph Cotten ) and his three sons attempting to revive the Southern cause with a million dollars in stolen money . The story starts out rather unbelievably as Jonas , with only two sons , wipe out a thirty man Union convoy from behind rocks and trees . Now that there's a ten thousand dollar bounty on their heads , their march back home to Nashville is fraught with peril on all sides . Jonas himself is rather a vile sort , establishing his authority early in the story , and when he yells jump , his sons know enough to ask how high . The development of the story allows enough time for son Ben ( Julian Mateos ) to come to question his father's autocratic supremacy , in no small part aided by a newly hired stand in daughter after maniac Jeff ( Gino Pernice ) dispatches the gold digging Kitty . However high stakes gambler Claire ( Norma Bengell ) is more than a match for Jonas when she pulls a fast one and has the group headed for Fort Brant where she insists her manufactured husband be buried . The whole time you wonder what evil plan Jonas will cook up for his ' daughter ' . There were a couple of clever symbolic moments in the story which left me wondering whether they were intentional . When the Indians appeared to seek justice for the death of the chief's daughter , it provoked a family Civil War , brother against brother with the outcome satisfactory to the chief . Anticipating a " Treasure of the Sierra Madre " type of ending , I expected to see the coffin release it's contents to the desert winds . The twist of course was just as satisfying , and led directly to an understated definition to the film's title . With time running out and the mission at a collapse , it was fitting to see the wounded Jonas slither across the parched banks of the Rio Hondo looking just like , well , a hellbender .
368560	2707735	48703	6.0	" Looks like we got all the foxes bottled up in one hole ! "	Well I don't know if there were more than three or four of the ten wanted men of the title to challenge Randolph Scott in this mid 1950's Western , which played a lot more like an oater from a decade or two earlier . This was not Scott's finest hour , which probably explains only a single outfit change from a plaid shirt to the standard black with white kerchief to wind up the picture . Probably the best reason to tune in is to catch some of the premier Western henchmen of the day chewing it up at the expense of the Stewart ( Scott ) clan . I think I prefer Richard Boone as a heavy , even though Paladin was a favorite character of mine . The best villain title of the picture goes to Leo Gordon in what could have easily been the second lead in the story to Randolph Scott himself . Gordon's character even turns on his boss Wick Campbell ( Boone ) , showing that you just can't trust a bad guy when it comes to money . Lee Van Cleef and Denver Pyle hadn't hit their peak yet as character actors , and it's cool to see them as part of Gordon's bad guy posse , even if they didn't last long . Skip Homeier makes quick work of Pyle , and Scott unceremoniously wastes Van Cleef's character in a quick gun battle . As for the main protagonists , I would have to say that the showdown between Randolph Scott and Richard Boone takes the prize as the shortest range shootout ever - about three feet across a wooden table ! They were so close they could have actually touched each other . Considering the way the picture started , that probably should have been the finale , but that was left to a Scott vs . Gordon confrontation that ended rather clumsily when the roof fell in . Seriously , Gordon went down under rafters and debris while Scott just stood there watching . I would have re-wound to see what I missed but I caught this on Encore Westerns , so there was no way for a do over . Oh yeah , there were a couple of romantic angles going on ( Homeier and Donna Martel , Scott and Jocelyn Brando ) , but the chemistry didn't seem right in either case . The picture ended with a double ring ceremony , but even that blew by pretty much off screen and you had to fill in the blanks yourself . All in all , a rather clumsy effort and not one of Randolph Scott's finest hours , though it might have been for Leo Gordon .
368057	2707735	23027	6.0	" Anything further , father ? "	Professor Quincy Adams Wagstaff ( Groucho Marx ) is the new president of Huxley College , and you get the impression that he feels about it as much as his opening song - " I'm Against It " ! . Wagstaff's main and perhaps only goal at Huxley is to produce a winning football team , good enough to defeat arch rival Darwin University . To do so , the plan is to kidnap two ringers from the local speakeasy , but this is The Marx Brothers , so the kidnapees turn out to be Baravelli ( Chico ) and Pinky ( Harpo ) . Thelma Todd is on hand as " college widow " Connie Bailey , and she is romanced in turn by each of the boys , as she attempts to hijack the Huxley play book . My favorite line from the film from Groucho / Wagstaff - " Why don't you bore a hole in yourself and let the sap out ? " Sheer Marx Brothers lunacy , and a fun ride , but don't expect the referee to enforce the rules .
367754	2707735	46876	6.0	" Even I , Lucas , have heard of the legend of a man fish . "	Just the name alone , " Creature From the Black Lagoon " conjures up all sorts of mental images of creepy , slimy monsters from murky underwater depths . And this 1954 Universal Film certainly delivers on that score , the legendary creature earning his place among the pantheon of Universal's all star lineup - Frankenstein , Dracula , Wolfman and The Mummy . The story however doesn't hold up as well as it's earlier classic counterparts , partly for it's lack of an enduring name star ( Karloff , Lugosi , Chaney ) , and partly for it's more modern look , having been released in 1954 . The film sets up the dramatic tension soon enough , within minutes we are treated to a quick glimpse of a fan shaped , webbed claw that eerily emanates from a swampy pool . In discussing the skeletal remains of an unknown creature discovered on a prior expedition , lead scientist David Reed ( Richard Carlson ) makes a prophetic statement about spaceships someday traveling to other planets . With financing provided by Mark Williams ( Richard Denning ) , the scientific group heads off to the upper Amazon Valley to try to unravel the mystery . Among the group is Reed's fiancé Kay Lawrence ( Julia Adams ) , providing the obligatory love interest for both Reed and the Creature . In fact , the Creature's obsession with Kay is craftily handled from the outset , it's first encounter resulting in a synchronized swim in the river and a playful tease of Kay's feet before she ever sets eyes on the monster . The underwater photography is deftly done , particularly since so much time is spent there . What does get somewhat annoying though is the persistent bickering between Reed and Williams on the goal of the expedition . Taking the scientific approach , Reed wants to catalog virtually everything to do with the Creature and it's habitat , while Williams wants nothing less than to capture the monster to make his mark in the scientific world . All bets are off though when the Gill-Man kidnaps Kay from the boat and brings her to his underwater grotto . In pursuit , Reed emerges into the grotto and is approached by a giant flying bat - did anyone else get the impression that it was about to turn into Count Dracula ? In somewhat of a standoff , Reed insures that the Creature is not harmed by the overzealous armed crew , as it makes it's way back into the safety of the lagoon . It appears to descend lifelessly into the murky depths , but even back in the 1950's the final fade seemed to scream sequel . And so it was , in two Creature follow ups , 1955's " Revenge of the Creature " and the 1956 film " The Creature Walks Among Us " , neither of which brought back any of the principals from the first film .
367643	2707735	31347	6.0	" Dead men don't recognize anybody . "	" Frontier Pony Express " features an early starring role for cowboy Roy Rogers , one in which he acquits himself reasonably well . Set in 1861 , Roy's a Pony Express rider and acknowledged as the best in the business , so it would be a major victory for Senator Lassiter Calhoun ( Edward Keane ) to convince Roy to cast aside his Union loyalties and work for the Confederacy . Calhoun's plans however go beyond that , he's attempting to establish California as a separate republic , one which he will lead as it's president . Rogers can't be bought , and the dramatic tension is established early on a number of fronts . Virtually all of Roy Rogers ' films employ a sidekick , and this one follows the pattern . Ray Hatton portrays Horseshoe , a trapper whose running gag has to do with a brooch he acquires from Mrs . Murphy ( Ethel Wales ) for a valuable beaver fur made from jackrabbits ! Horseshoe spends the length of the story trying to get it back as it trades hands among different folks in the story . Roy's romantic interest in the film is portrayed by Lynne Roberts , going by the name of Mary Hart . She played opposite Roy for a number of films in the late 1930's , to be followed by Pauline Moore , Jacqueline Wells and Sally Payne before Dale Evans became a staple following " The Cowboy and The Senorita " in 1944 . Hart's character flip flops loyalties a few times before the story's over , but winds up getting together with Roy in the finale . Generally , Roy would get to do at least three or four songs in his later films . Here he does a couple , including the standard ' My Old Kentucky Home ' and another tune titled ' Rusty Spurs ' . I was curious as to the selection of the first song , since Roy was a Northern sympathizer in the film . Even more curious though was the role of Roy's horse Trigger in the film . It appeared that Trigger was a Pony Express horse that Roy used during the story and didn't personally belong to him . Nevertheless , Trigger had his own reputation of sorts among the Express riders , since he was often requested by name . A riderless Trigger winds up saving a pouch full of Union vouchers by diving off a cliff into a lake to escape a bad guy posse , thereby earning another gold star as ' The Smartest Horse in the Movies ' . I'm sure there are loads of ' B ' Westerns with the Pony Express as a focal point , though I've only come across a couple myself . For anyone interested , check out the 1936 film titled " Cavalcade of The West " . It explores the beginnings of the Pony Express , and offers Hoot Gibson in a featured role .
368192	2707735	22676	6.0	" Oh that place , take it easy Sonny , this rushin ' will come in handy after you get there . "	Perhaps to underscore the quick pace of life in New York , " Big City Blues " moves along at a hectic sixty three minute pace , and tries to cram as much action as it can into that amount of time . Willow Station railroad agent ( Grant Mitchell ) has been there and done that , and bets a ten spot with a buddy that anxious traveler Bud Reeves ( Eric Linden ) will be back within a month . For his part , Bud is flush with enthusiasm and eleven hundred dollars and ready to make his mark on the big town . He's met by fast talking cousin " Gibby " Gibboney ( Walter Catlett ) , who has a knack for getting others to pay his way , and completely monopolizes the conversation in every scene he's in . He's on a first name basis with a few up and coming showgirls , particularly cute Vida Fleet ( Joan Blondell ) , who immediately becomes fond of the rube from Hoopersville , Indiana . Things move a bit too fast though , as Gibby organizes a welcome party for Bud in his room at the Hotel Hercules , and all manner of show biz types begin to arrive , among them Shep Adkins ( Humphrey Bogart ) . Shep is about to move in on Len Scully's ( Lyle Talbot ) girl , Lenny objects with his fists , and a brawl breaks out that leaves the young showgirl dead . Not knowing what to do , young Bud follows the example of everyone else at the party , he high tails it before the law can arrive . Night watchman Hummel ( Guy Kibbee ) revels in his five minutes of fame for finding the dead victim , while detective Quelkin ( Thomas Jackson ) tails Vida who he hopes can lead him to Bud Reeves , guilty until proved innocent . By accident , Hummel solves the case by going for his whiskey bottle in the hotel linen closet , where he finds Scully's body , a suicide victim with a shard of the broken bottle that neatly fits with the piece recovered by the police . Back at Willow Station , it only takes the railroad agent three days to collect on his bet , as Bud gratefully touches down on home turf . He still has visions of grandeur for life in New York , but has grown up enough to have some patience for it . Maybe next time , things will work out a bit better . By 1932 , Humphrey Bogart had a handful of movie credits to his name , but nothing significant as of yet . That was about to change with his next film , " Three on a Match " , which also co-starred Joan Blondell . Both would work together two more times , in 1936's " Bullets or Ballots " with Edward G . Robinson , and the 1937 comedy " Stand-In " . All are recommended for fans of either , while " Bullets or Ballots " is a fine early example of the mobster genre made popular by films like " Public Enemy " and " White Heat " .
367885	2707735	44460	6.0	" I don't want any part of any kind of war . . . , it has a bad smell . "	I found it interesting that the film's original working title was " The Rebel " , since some of the early footage was also used in the opening sequence of the 1959 Civil War TV series , " The Gray Ghost " . I'm pretty sure I've also seen it recycled in other movies with a Civil War theme . John Ireland stars as tired ex-soldier Jefferson Waring from Virginia , heading West without a gun and a vow to never use one against men again . Of course that's just the set up for the eventual finale when he does just that to take the side of settlers against scheming landowners led by Artemus Taylor ( Lon Chaney ) . Chaney's character is wheelchair bound throughout the story , but that doesn't prevent him from looking about as spooky as he did in any of his horror flicks . The most complex , actually frustrating character in the story for me was Marshal Harding ( Wayne Morris ) . He's in the pocket of villain Sam Tobin ( Lawrence Tierney ) , but is on the fence most of the time trying to keep a level playing field for Waring and his new friends . Curiously , he never uses his six gun , and actually seems to have an aversion to firing one ; he isn't even part of the finale when the settlers stand up for their rights . Where the film gets really gritty has to do with the treatment of Taylor's daughter Nora , who's every bit as ornery as her father . Following the ambush on Taylor's hired gunmen , she attempts to make a getaway with money from the local bank , and shoots banker Stone ( Charles Trowbridge ) in the process . Now it's not unusual for a woman in a ' B ' Western to get shot , even killed , but here , when Stone recovers , he shoots her IN THE BACK - Wow ! That was something I never thought I'd see , in fact , never even thought about it , even though it happened all the time when men were involved . A couple of things to keep an eye out for - early in the story when Waring first meets Peter Sharpe ( Frank Marlowe ) , they sit down , and Sharpe begins his conversation with " You know Randall . . . " . Ireland's character looks at Sharpe as if to say , ' hey , that's not my name ' , but the scene continues . Later on , I got a kick out of the funeral service being held in the local saloon for a couple that was killed by Taylor's goons . Right there on top of the bar was a sign stating - ' Bar Closed During Services ' !
368207	2707735	34613	6.0	" Someday the master will catch you , then you'll be sorry . "	I'm surprised at the rather low rating IMDb viewers have given this film , as I rather like the set up for this one . Beautiful young brides wind up dead at the altar just as they are about to recite their wedding vows , and their bodies are stolen shortly after . Mad scientist Dr . Lorenz ( Bela Lugosi ) is behind the mayhem in this low budget Monogram creep fest ; he uses glandular and spinal fluid from the victims to inject into his haggardly wife ( Elizabeth Russell ) to keep her young and beautiful . Countess Lorenz is rather one dimensional in her role , but at least she mimics Lugosi's speech pattern rather effectively . Lorenz is surrounded by a veritable menagerie of sideshow outcasts , including the wizened Fagah ( Minerva Urecal ) , and her two sons , one a hulking brute and another a freakish dwarf named Toby ( Angelo Rossitto ) . Hot on the trail of the missing bride mystery is reporter Pam Hunter ( Luana Walters ) , who follows up on her theory that the brides died from inhaling the sweet but deadly odor from a poisonous orchid developed by Dr . Lorenz . When Lorenz becomes wise to the reporter's initiative , he sets out to make her yet another victim , but alas , he's done in by his own sweet Fagah , in revenge for killing her brute son who had a penchant for stroking the hair of the doctor's corpses . " The Corpse Vanishes " offers just the right blend of atmospheric sets and bump in the night action to keep things interesting , a nifty little vehicle for Bela Lugosi's talents . You can have some fun with this one , made to order for that clichéd dark and stormy night .
367663	2707735	61587	6.0	" A man who knows what he wants is worth a lot . "	I would have lost a bet on whether Burt Reynolds ever appeared in a spaghetti Western , but you know what , this is actually a fairly entertaining flick once you get past the unbelievable body count by Reynolds ' title character , Navajo Joe . My unofficial count was twenty nine by the time the film was over , and when you throw in what had to be a dozen or so by the soldiers defending the money train , bandit leader Duncan ( Aldo Sambrell ) lost more guys than he started out with . I got a kick out of the scene when the Duncan brothers ride up on a pair of posters showing the reward for their capture , dead or alive . For Jeffrey Duncan ( Lucio Rosato ) , the two hundred dollar reward included ' murder , robbery , and other acts against the people of the U . S . ' Kind of makes you wonder what Mervyn Vee Duncan must have done to deserve a thousand dollar bounty . Incidentally , it was pretty cool how the elder Duncan crumpled up his brother's poster , but neatly secured his own after he took it down . Other reviewers on this site give high marks to the Ennio Morricone soundtrack , and it does have a catchy Indian themed spaghetti score . But I couldn't help noticing the repetitious ' Na-Va-Ho-Jo ' , ' Na-Va-Ho-Jo ' refrain , which if you think about it , would be a great scat line for a Howard Johnson in Arizona . Keep an eye on the opening scene when Duncan reaches to scalp the Indian woman he killed ; her eye twitches slightly before the camera cuts away . I managed to pick this film up on a four disc Western DVD set put out by Direct Source Special Products , a neat little package with additional films starring Telly Savalas , Martin Sheen and Clint Walker . Check your local Walmart bargain bin .
368235	2707735	26867	6.0	" An interesting example of antediluvian Americana . "	My experience of " The Phantom Empire " comes from the two hour movie pieced together from the twelve chapter serial , so admittedly , there is much I didn't get to see . To say that the film is unique is an understatement ; where else do you have a Western blending with sci-fi and dating back to 1935 ? Gene Autry stars in one of his earliest films , hosting a daily broadcast adventure with his Radio Riders . He's also assisted by Frankie and Betsy Baxter ( Frankie Darro and Betsy King Ross ) , who are the young leaders of the National Thunder Riders Association . The group is fashioned along the lines of the Boy Scouts , taking their name from the thundering sound of horses ridden by an underground race called the Muranians . Viewers are also treated to an early pairing of Gene with a very young Smiley Burnette , though his screen time is limited as one of Gene's Radio Ranch singers . As typical with " B " Westerns and serials of the era , the emphasis is on action and danger , here provided by unscrupulous men who invade Gene's ranch because of radium discovered there . Meanwhile underground , the action on the ranch is monitored by Queen Tika of the Muranians ( Dorothy Christy ) , who must protect her stronghold from the people of the surface world , while at the same time fending off a revolutionary advance by one of her ministers , High Chancellor Argo ( Wheeler Oakman ) . Science fiction tangles with science fact at all levels here , and it's a hoot trying to make sense of it . For example , the elevator that transports the Muranians back and forth travels a distance of 25 , 000 feet in about three seconds , that translates to about 6 , 000 miles per hour ! However there's one very interesting statement made by Queen Tika that proves to be entirely prophetic - " Get the captain of the Thunder Riders on the wireless cell phone ! " Before it's all over , Gene escapes from such terrors as the D-Ray Lithium Gun and the Chamber of Death , while impersonating a Muranian himself along the way . He obviously takes his role seriously , pay attention to an early scene when he's shot off his horse ; he hangs on to his hat while tumbling all the way down a hillside . If you don't have the patience for the five hour serial , the recently made available DVD from Digiviews offers a reasonable alternative , though purists may not think so . However the gist of the Phantom Empire experience is presented well enough here with acceptable quality , and enough songs by Gene Autry to make your viewing time worthwhile .
368174	2707735	24628	6.0	" I have my own way of dealing double crossers " .	I wouldn't have bet a plug nickel that " Sucker Money " would wind up as entertaining and interesting as it turned out to be . It had the look and feel of those 1930's era ' educational ' films that purported to warn the viewer about the dangers of illicit drugs , alcohol or sex , but in this case the film was an attempt at exposing the psychic racket . The story actually had decent continuity , even if some of the players presented were extremely over the top , starting with the phony Swami ( Mischa Auer ) , and including characters like Princess Karami ( Mona Lisa , why not use her real name ? ) , and the two black bodyguards dressed in their own set of Indian Hindu garb . Seeing them , I knew it was only a matter of time before the flick fell into racial stereotype , and they're shown throwing dice in a subsequent scene , as reporter Jimmy Reeves ( Earl McCarthy ) notes to the one rolling a winner - " Yo ' sho ' is lucky , Big Boy " ! The thing is , while watching , I got a sense that old Swami was a truly evil guy , and it wouldn't take much for him to dispose of anyone who got in the way of his making a really big score . Which got kind of wasted when he discovered Reeves ' real identity as a newspaper reporter , and then just let him roam around fairly freely within the confines of the operation . You would think that Jimmy would be a quick goner , and the Swami and his crowd could have pulled off the twenty thousand dollar heist of old Walton without any further trouble . It also seemed pretty convenient that the law showed up in time to make the save , but this was over seventy years ago , and there wasn't a whole lot of time and effort that went into making a story believable if put under a microscope . Which is OK if it passes the entertainment test , and I think this was a good try if one's not too critical . I really have to thank Mill Creek Entertainment for putting out a package that makes pictures like this available to old time film junkies like myself ; without them one would never even know that they existed . This one was part of a two hundred fifty movie set on sixty double sided DVD's as party of their Mystery Collection . The great thing is , by the time you get around to viewing all the movies in the set , you wind up forgetting what the first ones you saw were all about , and you can go ahead and do it all over again !

"	Filmed in 1932 , " Love Affair " has traces of the silent film era coming to a close , particularly in the wide eyed and innocent faces of the two female leads , Dorothy Mackaill as free wheeling socialite Carol Owen , and Astrid Allwyn as struggling actress Linda Lee . Linda is the sister of Humphrey Bogart's character Jim Leonard , a former flight instructor with bigger things on his mind , as he seeks financial backing for his new airplane motor that he touts as the " greatest motor in the world " . The only trouble is , wealthy businessman Bruce Hardy ( Hale Hamilton ) , who's willing to back Leonard , is also backing the penniless Carol Owen , who is completely in the dark about her financial situation . Hardy wants to marry Owen , even as he entertains an occasional dalliance with actress Lee , all without the knowledge of any of the other players . When Jim Leonard meets Carol , he is immediately smitten with her looks and charm , and begins spending time with her at the expense of the new company he's just formed . But there's a nagging feeling in the back of his mind that he's just not worthy of big spender and girl about town Carol . There's a well done counterpoint at the beginning of the film when Carol first meets Jim . She requests him for her first flying lesson , and he obliges by performing some daring flight stunts , chock full of rolls and dives . As Carol turns green ( you can tell , even though the film is black and white ) , she returns the favor once on the ground by giving Jim a harrowing ride into town in her roadster . At sixty eight minutes , the film is probably just a bit too short to effectively tell it's tale . There are a number of quick cuts and fades that create a somewhat choppy feel , though they are coherently done and maintain the flow of the story . In what could have been a disastrous ending , Carol , unwilling to marry Hardy for his money , and too embarrassed to come crawling to Jim , leaves a suicide note for airport manager Gilligan . As can be guessed , Jim races after Carol who's about to take off for a one way solo flight , and manages to create some tension as he hangs on for dear life of his own before scrambling into the cockpit of the airborne plane . The movie closes on the two lovebirds as they head off into the skies , Bogey thumbs up to indicate everything will be A-OK . Humphrey Bogart had five films under his belt by the time " Love Affair " was released . This would actually be his first leading role , and though capably done , it would be a few more years before he got to portray real meaty characters like Duke Mantee in " The Petrified Forest " ( 1936 ) , and " Bugs " Fenner in the gangster drama " Bullets or Ballots " ( 1936 ) . As a Bogey fan , I recommend them all , even if you're not .
367878	2707735	43733	7.0	" Well corn my pone and chit my chittlins . . . "	The thing I noticed about thirty minutes into the picture was how complicated the plotting got for a movie from the early Fifties . Not what I was expecting from a title like " The Lemon Drop Kid " , whose title character is wonderfully performed by one of my all time favorites - Bob Hope . Hope is his trademark self most of the time with the snappy quips and one liners , but it wasn't just Hope playing Hope , indeed it appeared that Bob actually got into his character based on a Damon Runyon story . With any other actor , The Lemon Drop Kid might have come across as the smarmy con man that he was written to be , but Hope makes him a likable chap , even when he's robbing you blind . The other major curve that the picture throws at you about mid-way through is that all of a sudden , it becomes a Christmas story ! I wasn't really ready for that , and yet right from the opening sound of " Silver Bells " , it all seems to fit together perfectly around a con game to bring home the bacon for Nellie Thursday's Home For Old Dolls . Hope has just the perfect cast of characters to pull off this grift - Jay C . Flippen , Ben Weldon , and Tor Johnson among others , and it was especially cool to catch William Frawley in a role apart from his Fred Mertz character . I'm not so sure this bunch could have pulled off the caper in real life quite so easily , but I think you can cut the film some slack in that regard ; getting there was all the fun it could be . With any of these older flicks , I'm always on the lookout for reminders of simpler times gone by - how about a hot pastrami sandwich for fifty cents ! Say , I wonder too , if you can still get a salami gift wrapped for the holidays ? There's also the era preoccupation with getting as many profile shots of the picture's leading lady into view as possible . On that score , Marilyn Maxwell's figure never disappoints , strategically positioned whenever possible in conversation with Lemon Drop or Oxford Charley ( Lloyd Nolan ) . After a while I began to wonder why she ever stuck it out with The Kid , but I guess every heel has some redemptive qualities . I don't know if I'd make this a must see every year at Christmas time , but then again , it might not be the worst choice out there . It takes you back to a way simpler time than say , " Bad Santa " , and you won't have to screen out the language for young viewers . All in all , a fun picture and a fine effort from Bob Hope and his gang of usual suspects .
367706	2707735	39372	7.0	" I knew that tonight , I'd be afraid of the dark . "	It's hard to separate DeForest Kelley from his Star Trek persona as Dr . Leonard " Bones " McCoy , so it's always a blast to see him in a totally unrelated role . He guest starred in many T . V . Westerns of the 1950's and 60's , but to see him actually playing the lead in the 1947 noir film " Fear in the Night " was a veritable treat . Kelley's character is Vince Grayson , a rather meek bank clerk who has a dream that he kills someone . As circumstances suggest that he actually might have done it , he confides in brother in law Cliff ( Paul Kelly ) , a police detective who at first dismisses Grayson's ramblings , and then begins an investigation when a rain shortened day trip brings them to the scene of the crime . Major suspension of belief is required here , as Grayson locates the house where his dreams took place , and why one asks , would the day tripping foursome seek shelter in an unoccupied house just because of a little rain ? I got a kick out of a goofy conversation on an elevator when DeForest Kelley's character asks if it can go any faster ; the operator's response - " I've got it wide open " ! Long story short - Vince Grayson DID kill someone , but he was hypnotized into doing so . If you just go with the flow , this is an entertaining and provocative mystery , but not to be taken too seriously . The print I viewed on DVD had some annoying cuts and jumps , though it didn't appear that the story was affected . The early narration by Kelley's character had a Peter Lorre quality to it that got my attention . View it for DeForest Kelley's performance , all the more memorable since it's also his very first credited movie role !
368266	2707735	31747	7.0	" I haven't done anything , except kill a lot of coyotes in self defense , if you want to put it in law talk . "	If you can't picture James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart as gun totin ' Western outlaws , then give yourself a treat and try " The Oklahoma Kid " . Granted , neither actor appears as comfortable in their cowboy persona as they do as gangsters , but they manage to pull off a fairly credible and interesting story , with a rather talented cast around them . The setting is the 1883 land rush that civilizes the six million acre Oklahoma Territory known as the Cherokee Strip , and future site of the city of Tulsa . Cagney's entrance as the Oklahoma Kid is heralded by his hijacking of Whip McCord's ( Bogart ) plunder of a stagecoach carrying money in payment for Indian land . The Kid is the " good " outlaw , who for the remainder of the film plays out his secret identity of Jim Kincaid , who's businessman father ( Hugh Sothern ) and sheriff brother ( Harvey Stephens ) attempt to bring McCord and his gang to justice following their illegal land grab . Adding an element of romance to the story is the presence of Jane Hardwick ( Rosemary Lane ) , daughter of Judge Hardwick ( Donald Crisp ) , who's involved with sheriff Ned , but is immediately smitten with The Kid ; Oklahoma endears himself to newcomers by asking them to " feel the air " . When bully McCord frames John Kincaid for murder , he sends a phony letter to Judge Hardwick to get him out of town , so his own hand picked replacement can push through a guilty verdict . With time running out , The Kid is too late to stop the mob hanging of his father , and sets out to administer his own brand of justice on McCord's henchmen - Indian Joe , Curley , Handley ( Ward Bond ) , and Doolin . The finale finds the Oklahoma Kid and McCord in a rather well staged barroom brawl that ends with the " good " bad guy on the winning end . OK , high drama it's not ; for a truly memorable film of classic status in a Western setting with either of these stars , you'll have to turn to Bogart's " Treasure of the Sierra Madre " . But if it's offbeat Cagney and Bogey you're after , this is a good place to start . You'll have a better time too if you go for the enjoyment factor and not for critical viewing , there's enough fun stuff here to take the edge off a rainy afternoon .
368513	2707735	463959	7.0	" You an outlaw now , Pa ? "	With the Hallmark name attached I expected somewhat more from " Desolation Canyon " and was less than impressed and satisfied with this picture . The feature players were prominent enough to carry off their roles , but somehow Patrick Duffy didn't seem to pull it off as the grizzled sheriff of Green River . There was no hard edge to his demeanor , and even less urgency to taking up the chase after the Press Reynolds gang after they kidnap a young boy . Now I can bow to the wisdom of his older partner Sam ( Stacy Keach ) who seemed to know a whole lot more about the tracking business than sheriff Swede . As it turns out , the quarry includes Swede's own son turned outlaw , and the kidnapped boy is Sam's grandson Abe . The good guys are aided by an uprooted Boston banker ( David Rees Snell ) who knows something about handling firearms , and that's one of the twists of the story . In one of the better conceived scenes of the film , Edwin confronts bounty hunter Winters , leaving him both confounded and weaponless when he simply takes a six gun right out of his hand . On the flip side , that probably would never happen in a real life situation . Another scene defying credibility occurs when the good guy trio pauses on the trail at a saloon , soon followed by Press Reynolds ( Kenny Johnson ) and his main henchman Jack McAllister ( Courtney Gains ) . Press and his boys blew up the bank at Green River , stole seven hundred dollars , and conspired with Johnny Kendrick ( Victor Browne ) to kidnap Johnny's son . With all the build up aimed at convincing the viewer what a fearsome reputation Sam Kendrick had as a gunman , the movie could have been almost over right then and there . But nothing happened . At least some credit goes to the kidnapped boy Abe , wisely leaving a wooden toy horse on the trail as a clue to follow . Later when one of the wounded outlaws is left to oversee the boy , and just as I finished saying to myself the kid just ought to get up and go , the kid just gets up and goes ! However take away points for running into an open field where the gang picks him up again to resume the cat and mouse game . As other posters on the film have noted , clichés abound , mainly written for Patrick Duffy's character , but the one that came out wildly but unintentionally funny was uttered by hard boiled Sam at the final showdown - " Reynolds , you worthless piece of . . . . dung ! ! ! Obviously cleaned up for the Hallmark audience , the remark only drew more attention to itself as wholly unrealistic given the circumstances . It's soon overshadowed though when Reynolds sends Johnny out with a single bullet to kill his father . In probably the only moment they ever faced each other man to man , Johnny implores - " Make sure Abe don't turn out like you and me " - just before he's sent to Boot Hill by Reynolds . Except for the gorgeous scenery and superb cinematography , " Desolation Canyon " winds up merely adequate as a made for TV Western , while the relentless pace of the commercials in the final third of the story didn't help . Even the title hearkens back to the days of the ' B ' Western , when the name of the film had little or nothing to do with the story . There never was mention made of a canyon , desolate or otherwise , and the final showdown occurred at Antelope Springs .
368029	2707735	24314	7.0	" Excuse me boss , I ain't no lawyer , I can't talk without thinking . "	" The Mayor Of Hell " has the feel of an early Dead End Kids film , but with a much harder edge and very few light spots , preceding the first appearance of the Dead Enders by four years . James Cagney has a full screen opening credit , even though technically , the ' mayor ' of the movie's title is actually portrayed by Frankie Darro , one of several boys sent to reform school during the opening scenes . Darro's character is Jimmy Smith , a young tough who's befriended by ' Patsy ' Gargan ( Cagney ) , and is elected to the position when Gargan takes a chance at humanizing conditions at a state reformatory . Warner Brothers made a lot of these types of films , attempting to provide a conscience of sorts in an era that only too well knew about the effects of crime and poverty . This movie is quite gritty , with no apologies for ethnic stereotyping , as in the submissive posture of a black father in court or the way a Jewish kid gets to run a candy shop in the reform school . The rules at the reformatory are simple enough - work hard and keep your mouth shut ; step out of line and you answer personally to Warden Thompson ( Dudley Digges ) . Cagney's role in the story seems somewhat ambiguous , since even though he makes a serious effort to improve conditions inside the reformatory , on the outside he's still nominally in control of a criminal racket . The film's attempt to juggle this dichotomy falls short in my estimation , the finale attempts to wrap things up in a neat package as Gargan awaits the outcome of a near fatal shooting of one of his henchmen . Not exactly the kind of role modeling one would look for in a film like this . Warner Brothers would sanitize some of the elements of this story in a 1938 remake titled " Crime School " , featuring Humphrey Bogart in the Cagney role , and Billy Halop in the Frankie Darro part . If you're partial to the Dead End Kids you'll probably like the latter film better , since it also offers familiar faces like Leo Gorcey , Huntz Hall , Bobby Jordan and Gabriel Dell . However the ending is somewhat muddied in that one too , with Bogart's warden character involved in a cover up of a prison breakout . Both films offer a romantic interest for the lead characters , in ' Mayor ' , Madge Evans is a reform minded nurse that falls for Cagney's character . Curiously , a lot of James Cagney's early films aren't commercially available , so you'll have to keep your eyes peeled for a screening on Turner Classics , or source the film from a private collector . Personally , I can't get enough of this kind of stuff , and find intriguing points of interest in the films of all genres from the Thirties and Forties .
367703	2707735	25238	7.0	" Holy smoke , look at the trim lines on that destroyer ! "	For me , it's always cool to come away from a picture with something that was entirely unexpected . In the case of " Here Comes The Navy " , I literally did a jump in my seat to see and hear mention of the U . S . S . Arizona , the famed battleship that went down during the infamous Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that brought our country into World War II . I had only seen this huge ship before in documentary footage covering that historical event , so it was a rare treat to see aspects of daily routine occurring aboard ship during the film's run . The other treat of course , is catching Jimmy Cagney and Pat O'Brien in the first of their many team-ups for First National / Warner Brothers . You know , I still can't get over the fact that some of their best work together took place over seventy years ago ! In this one , the duo is at odds with each other , as Cagney's character Chesty O'Connor , signs up for a stint in the Navy just to get aboard the ship commanded by his nemesis Biff Martin ( O'Brien ) . There's not a whole lot of credibility to the timing and coincidence necessary for that particular circumstance to take place , but that's no problem for the movies . Complicating matters further , wouldn't you know , is that Martin has a sister ( Gloria Stuart ) that Chesty goes for , so right there you've got the makings for an even more heated rivalry . Speaking of which , that seemed to be a common plot element in many of the early Warner Brothers flicks of the era . In the 1937 prison movie " San Quentin " , inmate Humphrey Bogart had a sister that the warden fell for , thereby giving the impression that Bogey's character was getting preferential treatment . The warden - Pat O'Brien ! You really have to catch one of Cagney's early films to get a sense of where all that enormous talent came from . This picture offers a dance scene , part of the ' Iron Workers ' Frolic ' , that allows Cagney to strut his fancy footwork . I got a kick out of the poster advertising the dance contest ; I've never seen one before that promoted ' Big Doings ' ! Just another one of the visual treats you can appreciate from a picture from the 1930's . Another was catching Guinn ' Big Boy ' Williams as the dance floor manager looking almost impossibly young , but in checking , I was shocked to learn that by the time of this movie's release , he had already been in over eighty pictures ! ! ! Learning something new every day . Anyway , story wise , you won't find anything resembling an Oscar contender here , but you can still have some fun with this first Cagney / O'Brien team up . Character actor Frank McHugh , a frequent Cagney supporter is on hand to lend comic relief . His gimmick has to do with buying his mother a pair of false teeth - and to think , back then you could do it for twenty dollars ! Now that's the good old days !
368531	2707735	58165	7.0	" When you keep a rattlesnake around , you always pull his fangs . "	The setting is Comanche Creek , Colorado , 1875 ; a band of outlaws headed by Amos Troop ( DeForest Kelley ) breaks an unsuspecting jailbird out of the town lockup and kills the deputy . The gang then uses the outlaw as a front man for their other robberies . As the reward money on the bad guy escalates , the gang then shoots him and turns him in for the reward , all nice and legal like . Only trouble is , this time the victim was a member of the National Detective Agency gone undercover , and a close friend of Bob Gifford ( Audie Murphy ) . Now the job of infiltrating the gang goes to " Gif " , who insinuates himself into Comanche Creek society as a free spending high roller , as the agency creates a back story and wanted poster for " Judd Tanner " . The earlier Murphy Westerns usually cast him in the baby face role of a good guy ; in 1959's " No Name on the Bullet " , Murphy's character John Gant was a hired assassin , and even then his youngish countenance didn't seem to match his character . Here the older Murphy pulls off the outlaw gimmick a bit better , with wits quick enough to match the ever changing dynamics of his masquerade . When the cover is blown on the agency plant , Tanner maintains his cool , only revealing his identity to gang member Bill Carter , who's anxious to leave the outlaw life behind . With a lesser known supporting cast , the gunfight of the title eventually sets things right and settles the score against the bad guys , who have been masterminded by the sheriff of Comanche Creek , Marshal Shearer ( John Hubbard ) . DeForest Kelley is so closely identified with his Star Trek role as Dr . Leonard " Bones " McCoy , it's easy to forget that he appeared in a fair share of Westerns , beginning with a 1949 Lone Ranger appearance . He also turned up in episodes of " Gunsmoke " , " Trackdown " , " Rawhide " and a host of others . " Gunfight at Comanche Creek " winds up being a fairly intriguing Western , made so by the plot twists that keep Murphy's character on his toes . I found the background narrative a bit annoying though , as the story played itself out well enough without the commentary ( by uncredited narrator Reed Hadley ) . Otherwise it's a generally worthwhile hour and a half of Audie Murphy entertainment . Update - / 2007 - Apparently , this movie was a remake of the 1957 film , " Last Of The Badmen " , with Audie Murphy reprising the role of George Montgomery . Both movies were released by Allied Artists , even though the writers credited for each film are different . Check it out !
368548	2707735	27440	7.0	" Look at him . . . , that guy sings every night , it makes me screwy . "	The beginning credits of " Charlie Chan at the Opera " casts Warner Oland vs Boris Karloff , though Chan's investigation ultimately causes him to protect Karloff's character , the insane opera singer Gravelle . With a sufficiently mysterious and atmospheric opening scene , Gravelle is introduced as a resident of the Rockland State Sanitarium , where he has been living as an amnesiac for the past seven years . When a newspaper brought by an attendant features his former wife Lilli Rochelle ( Margaret Irving ) on the front page , Gravelle's memories slowly begin to surface , and he embarks on a desperate journey to recover a past that included an unsuccessful attempt on his life . The 20th Century Fox Charlie Chan films are notable for their strong continuity from film to film . Note that when Chan first appears on the scene in the office of Police Inspector Regan ( Guy Usher ) , Regan compliments him on how he solved his most recent case with only a minor clue . This occurred in " Charlie Chan at the Race Track " , the film immediately prior to " Opera " - " Small thing sometimes tell large story . " Unfortunately , another element from the Chan films is glaringly apparent here as well , as Police Sergeant Kelly ( William Demarest ) is given the racist chore of denigrating Orientals - " Where's Regan and his pal Egg Foo Yung ? " Be alert for an error that got past the film's producers while still at Inspector Regan's office . As Chan examines Gravelle's newspaper recovered from the Sanitarium , he comments on the presence of a footprint that the suspect must have left as a clue prior to tearing it up in a rage . However if you rewind to the earlier scene , the torn paper hits the floor with not a mark on it ! " You Will Die Tonight " is the message on a floral greeting card that brings Lilli Rochelle to the Inspector's office , along with her lover , baritone singer Enrico Borelli ( Gregory Gaye ) . Chan's first step in the investigation brings him to the floral shop that sold the arrangement , where we are introduced to Number # 1 Son Lee ( Keye Luke ) who joins his " Pop " on the case . Lee spends most of his time in the film disguised in theater garb as a costumed soldier , providing the comic relief as he thwarts Detective Kelly's feeble attempts to uncover his identity . It turns out that Gravelle seeks revenge for being locked in a burning theater many years ago , the victim of Madame Lilli and her lover Borelli . When both in turn wind up dead in the theater during performances of the opera " Carnival " , Gravelle becomes the most likely of suspects . But as in all Charlie Chan films , the obvious suspect is never the real culprit . In this case , it's Madame Borelli herself who uses the presence of a maniac as a cover to dispatch her cheating husband and lover , given away by the blood stained sash that Charlie recovers as a final clue . " Charlie Chan at the Opera " is regarded as one of the best , if not THE best of the Chan series ; it's on my top five list as well . In addition to the compelling and well laid out mystery , there's also the presence of the decidedly sinister Boris Karloff . The best line of the film occurs following the ruckus in the theater caused by the first Gravelle sighting . In a nod of respect to Karloff's most famous film role , the stage manager utters - " This opera is going on tonight even if Frankenstein walks in ! "
368583	2707735	64273	7.0	" If innocence is repaid with prison , then I've earned the right to kill " .	Klaus Kinski is one of the few B list performers I'll go out of my way to see , and this Euro-West feature is a good example of his sinister presence on screen . You'll generally catch him as a villain since he so naturally looks the part , though in " And God Said to Cain ' he portrays an anti-hero out for revenge against the man who framed him for a gold robbery during the Civil war . The film is a good one if you stay with the basic premise , but it's sure tough to follow the action as most , probably three quarters of the picture takes place at night . Complicating matters further , Kinski's character , Gary Hamilton , traverses the underground caves of Santa Maria while on his mission of revenge . A conveniently conceived tornado also hits town to lend a further atmospheric dimension to the story , though that doesn't amount to much more than a big wind . The picture provides a couple of cool elements I haven't seen in a Western before , much less the spaghetti variety . The dripping water in the cave in an early scene seemed to provide a natural musical accompaniment to the movements on screen just before Hamilton took out his first victim . Later on , I thought it was pretty clever the way Hamilton made a bell ringer out of Miguel , if you know what I mean . I'm certainly not as well versed on the genre as many of the other posters on this board , and I usually learn a lot about a film by reading what others have to say . What I found most interesting about this film's background was the horror influence inspired by it's director Antonio Margheriti . In the picture , those elements are used to good effect to enhance and build tension in the story . The outcome itself is fairly predictable , so it's up to the ride that gets you there to be as entertaining as possible .
367767	2707735	27407	7.0	" Whenever mugs get into a jam , the first thing they do is start knifing each other . "	Detective Johnny Blake ( Edward G . Robinson ) plays both sides of the law in this 1936 gangster / crime drama . In the early part of the film , we see an increasingly disillusioned Blake forge an odd relationship with crime boss Al Kruger ( Barton MacLane ) . But when anti crime publisher Ward Bryant is murdered by Kruger's top man Nick " Bugs " Fenner ( Humphrey Bogart ) , it's fully revealed that Blake is working undercover for old friend and new Police Commissioner Dan McLaren ( Joe King ) . Kruger takes in Johnny Blake because of his fierce reputation for integrity , and both quickly become the target of " Bugs " Fenner , who up till then has had the number one spot in Kruger's gang . As Johnny masterminds a new source of revenue from running a numbers game in the Bronx and Harlem , his star rises while Fenner steams . Johnny also has to contend with the pretty Lee Morgan ( Joan Blondell ) who initiated the numbers racket , but is now being cut out of the action by Kruger's edict . Working from the inside , Blake turns over information to McLaren ; and as profits from the numbers game escalate , Kruger's other operations get hammered by McLaren's forces on the street . As Fenner reaches the boiling point , he takes out Kruger and goes gunning for Blake . Meanwhile , the invisible heads of the crime syndicate backing Kruger are revealed as ( dis ) honest businessmen cashing in on all the illegal activity . Fingered by a Fenner crony , Johnny and " Bugs " shoot it out on the steps outside a city apartment . Blake hangs on long enough to make his final report to the police commissioner , his only regret being he won't be able to enjoy a last beer with the boss . " Bullets or Ballots " is a taut crime drama , showcasing Edward G . Robinson some five years following his breakout performance in " Little Caesar " . He and Bogart would appear in five films altogether , " Key Largo " being the most highly acclaimed , and the only film in which Bogey would get top billing over Robinson . But for sheer entertainment value , I would recommend 1938's " The Amazing Dr . Clitterhouse " , which showcases a much wider range of Robinson's acting ability . Joan Blondell appeared with Bogart in 1932's " Three on a Match " and 1937's " Stand-In " , along with an uncredited Bogey appearance in 1932's " Big City Blues " . " Bullets or Ballots " is the only time she and Robinson worked together .
368149	2707735	62218	7.0	" My only bad luck is you're not dead yet . "	It's a bit unusual seeing Dean Martin play the part of a villain , especially having been a regular viewer of his variety show back in the 1960's . I couldn't help thinking that any minute he would enter the Ace Deuce , hop up on a piano and start belting out ' That's Amore ' . There was at least one similarity to Martin's weekly show with the presence of a gorgeous blonde babe hanging around . No , not Jean Simmons , but that saloon girl Claire ( Carol Andreson ) , who if I had to bet , would probably have shown up on one of his shows as well . Actually , Martin handled the role of a heavy pretty well , but I kept wondering if the movie might have been better served with Dino and George Peppard switching roles . The casting of Slim Pickens as Alex Flood's ( Martin ) top henchman also seemed to go against the grain . I mean , can you picture Andy Devine as a bad guy , or Smiley Burnette , or Chill Wills , or . . . , well you get the idea . But at least Pickens took the role and ran with it , nasty bull whip and all . As for Peppard , he becomes the reluctant hero after Flood pushes all the right buttons , and especially when he makes the move on Molly Lang's ( Simmons ) stagecoach business . Martin's character makes it a point to own fifty one percent of every enterprise in Jericho , but you know , I kept wondering why he allowed the 4 Aces Saloon to operate in town ; it didn't seem like Jericho was all that big . Hey , can you beat those medical fees back in the 1800's ? For fixing up a gunshot wound in old Ben Hickman ( John McIntire ) the Doc charges just a dollar ! Kind of makes you wonder how much it cost to go to med school . Too bad Hickman didn't make it to the end of the picture , I kind of liked his deliberate , methodical style . Of course the ending is never in question , the fun is in watching how the good guy plan separates Flood's gang of outlaws so they can narrow the odds . The one thing I would have allowed for earlier in the story would be showing Peppard's character and his prowess with a knife . As it is , the way Dolan took out Flood made me sit up and ask , ' where did that come from ' ?
368514	2707735	31060	7.0	" Have you got a pencil , I left my typewriter in my other pants . "	Future viewers of " At The Circus " be warned - " Lydia , Oh Lydia ( The Tattooed Lady ) " is one of those tunes that stays with you long after the movie is over . It happened the first time I watched this film , and it's happening right now as I write this review . That's not necessarily a bad thing , provided you don't drive your family crazy with the lyrics over and over again . That's one of the bright spots of this Marx Brothers escapade , in a film that spotlights a ten thousand dollar circus heist , an inverted ceiling walker / aerial trapeze artist ( Eve Arden ) , and a club wielding gorilla named Gibraltar . Put all those elements together and you have an amusing and entertaining little number , though not generally credited as one of the Marx Brothers finest . Perennial wealthy Groucho patron Margaret Dumont makes her appearance rather late in this movie , befuddled as usual about attorney J . Cheever Loophole's intentions , which are actually commendable - he's attempting to negotiate a ten thousand dollar payday to save the Wilson Wonder Circus from the clutches of evil financier Carter ( James Burke ) . Earlier , owner Jeff Wilson ( Kenny Baker ) fell victim to Carter's strong arm and henchman Goliath ( an unrecognizable Nat Pendleton ) , who in concert with circus midget Little Professor Atom ( Jerry Maren ) , stole the money that would have given Wilson clear ownership . The clichéd theme is rounded out by Wilson's romantic interest Julie Randall ( Florence Rice ) , who probably should have been given more to do than just look pretty . The movie boasts a rather involved musical number featuring Harpo and a large , young black cast before settling into a standard harp routine . In an amusing sketch , Chico's character Antonio Perelli continually frustrates Groucho's attempt to interrogate the little professor about the stolen money . Later , Chico and Harpo team up to wreak havoc in Goliath's stateroom ; the feathers fly ( literally ) as they try to find the missing stash . Goliath by the way , bears such a striking resemblance to Harpo , that more could probably have been done to capitalize on the similarity . As in " The Big Store " , the movie spirals out of control with a rousing trapeze number featuring the boys , Peerless Pauline and Gibraltar the gorilla . It's vintage Marx Brothers , so swing your way to a good time !
368130	2707735	42324	7.0	" OK Coach , where's the field and who do we play ? "	With some minor plot revisions , " Chain Lightning " would just about qualify as a remake of Humphrey Bogart's 1936 film , " China Clipper " . In both stories , Bogey's character is a former military pilot who takes on a civilian job as a test pilot for demanding bosses . Raymond Massey portrays the owner of the Willis Aircraft Company , a role performed in the earlier film by Pat O'Brien . Both men are hard driving , ruthless individuals who put work and success above having a personal life , whose ambition test the people around them , including the Bogey character . The minor difference might be in the romantic interest for Bogart ; in ' Clipper ' there was none , here he's on again , off again with Jo Holloway ( Eleanor Parker ) in a romance that tests one's patience throughout the film . I don't know when the device was first used , but in this movie , the opening scene serves as the introduction to a flashback narrative that winds up back at the same point later in the film . The bookends are fairly successful in delivering a complete story , but left this viewer wondering how much of it was based in fact . A reference was made to breaking the sound barrier by Chuck Yeager's earlier 1946 flight , and it seems that the story builds on technological advances in the history of military flight building up to the invention of the ejector pod . Bogey's conflicted character is in it for the money right up to the point he hears his buddy's voice recorder message detailing how he lost his life in a failed test of a ' JA-4 ' experimental craft . Will he or won't he ? If it means hurtling back to Earth to be with his one true love Jo , all systems say go . I must say , I was a bit dismayed by Colonel Matt Brennan's ( Bogart ) post war job prospects . He's shown running his own flight school and charging customers three dollars an hour for the privilege . When a novice crash lands his only plane , it's time to look for more meaningful possibilities . What he's offered at Massey's company turns out to be seven hundred fifty dollars per MONTH ! The good old days swung both ways . Humphrey Bogart and Raymond Massey worked together once before in the 1943 war adventure " Action in the North Atlantic " . Interestingly , Bogey was top billed in both films , while Massey's character was his boss in both . Sometimes things just work out that way . As mentioned earlier , the film doesn't elaborate on events portrayed when it comes to accuracy . Obviously the ejector pod was someone's good idea at some point in time , but the way it's presented here would have meant more in a historical context . Even so , this viewer was kept interested enough by events in the film , even if the romantic angle between the principals seemed forced . Perhaps the film makers couldn't decide between Bogey landing his girl the easy way or the hard way .
367691	2707735	31149	7.0	" If you did do it , I'm all for you . That woman had at least one murder coming to her . "	" Charlie Chan in Reno " offers a cleverly woven mystery in which the murder suspects are all revealed to have had some involvement with each other in the past . It helps when watching to keep a scorecard to keep track of events and relationships so the final revelation makes sense . Not only do we have a murder victim , but an attempted murder as well . When Mary Whitman ( Pauline Moore ) is found over the dead body of Jeanne Bentley ( Louise Henry ) , she of course is the obvious suspect , and with a firm motive ; Bentley was going to marry Whitman's about to be ex-husband . But Bentley had a unique way of alienating most everyone with her ingratiating manner , not the least of which was another suitor , Wally Burke ( Robert Lowery ) . Burke comes across as suitably suspicious , as does Dr . Ainsley ( Ricardo Cortez ) , who is surprised to be discovered in the murder room of the Hotel Sierra , claiming to be looking for the money won by Bentley at the casino , offering robbery as the motive for the crime . Charlie Chan ( Sidney Toler in his second performance as the Oriental Detective ) is aided in the case by Number # 2 Son Jimmy ( Victor Sen Yung , credited as Sen Yung ) . Jimmy is on spring break from the University of Southern California , and gets himself mugged by a pair of con men who steal his borrowed car ; he's identified by " Pop " in a police line up . There's also Police Chief King ( played straight by Charles D . Brown ) and an inept Reno Sheriff Tombstone Fletcher ( Slim Summerville ) . Fletcher is quick to dismiss Chan's serious questioning and investigative work , preferring to pin the crime on the innocent Mary Whitman . Once Charlie gets down to business , a whole host of new clues and information come to light . The investigation eventually leads to an abandoned ghost town outside of Reno , and yet another suspect , this time Jeanne Bentley's ex husband George . For trivia fans , there are two actors in " Reno " that also appeared in Toler's first Chan adventure in " Honolulu " . Phyllis Brooks as Vivian Wells is ultimately revealed to be the murderer ; while Eddie Collins does a comic turn as the talkative cab driver . Collins was the lion keeper aboard a freighter in the " Honolulu " film . Before the mystery is over , Chan unravels an entire network of entanglements that connect the murder victim with each of the suspects , and the suspects with one another . It's rather cleverly done , and promotes this film to one of the better Charlie Chan titles , particularly those of Sidney Toler .
368344	2707735	34428	7.0	" I never discussed being a traitor with a man , you'll find it easier if you don't think about that part of it . "	The original theatrical trailer to " Across the Pacific " offers Sydney Greenstreet introducing the story as an even more astonishing tale to tell than " The Maltese Falcon " . He should know , he was there for both , reuniting with fellow co-stars Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor in a tale of espionage and intrigue touted with the tag line " behind every smile an invitation to disaster " . The film opens on November 17 , 1941 , with Bogie's character Rick Leland summarily dismissed from the Army for the indiscretion of borrowing military funds . With a reputation that moves even quicker than he does , Rick is turned down for service in the Royal Canadian Army , or as a wartime recruiting poster advertises - Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry . With time on his hands , Rick boards the freighter Genoa Maru , seemingly to cross paths with a mysterious woman introduced to us as Alberta Marlow ( Astor ) , yet with a larger goal in mind , that of finding a sponsor so he can fight yet again . It's not until he arrives in New York that we learn that Leland is in fact a spy , attempting to get the goods on the saboteur , Dr . B . F . G . Lorenz ( Greenstreet ) , and Japanese plans to blow up the Canal Zone . Interestingly , the Japanese are depicted on both sides of the American fence . Lorenz describes them as " wonderful little people " , as Captain Higoto of the Genoa Maru dispatches an adversary in a New York back alley , and henchman Joe Totsuiko ( Victor Sen Yung ) demonstrates his judo skills in a couple of scenes . Yet in Panama , Leland's friend and hotel owner Sam Wing On ( Lee Tung Foo ) demonstrates genuine concern for Rick's well being , and directs him to a theater where he'll get his next set of instructions . With ominous portent , the date on a Panamanian newspaper reads December 6 , 1941 , Pearl Harbor looming only one day away , even as the headline reads " Hirohito Reply to Roosevelt Will Insure Peace " . Snappy dialog and gritty one liners are a trademark of the film with Astor's character getting off her own fair share of zingers , keeping the romantic angle between her and Rick sufficiently off balance . Apparently , the writers were quite pleased with themselves over a line that's uttered not once , but twice ; referencing the difference between their respective firearms , Bogie warns Greenstreet's character - " Remember , mine's bigger than your's " . Bogart fans will no doubt be intrigued by the coincidences between " Across the Pacific " and some of his other movies . For example , the " Fat Man " line is used by Bogie's contact in the Panama Theater , a reference to Greenstreet's character , and a description that followed him from " The Maltese Falcon " . The name of " Sam " , the hotel owner in Panama , would turn up again almost immediately as that of Rick Blaine's piano player in " Casablanca " . And need it be pointed out , Bogart is " Rick " in both films ! As a fan of the Charlie Chan series of films from the 1930's and 40's , I was intrigued by the fact that Number # 1 and 2 Sons both appeared in this movie . Although Keye Luke has a throwaway part as a steamship office clerk , Victor Sen Yung enjoys a meatier role as Greenstreet's heavy . Oddly , out of forty two surviving Chan films , they only appeared once as brothers together , in 1948's " The Feathered Serpent " . With both " The Maltese Falcon " and " Across the Pacific " sharing name stars along with director John Huston , the comparison between the two films is inevitable . I find " Falcon " to be the superior film , but don't let that dissuade a would be viewer . However with " Pacific " , you'll have to overlook the array of coincidences necessary for the story to unfold , particularly with respect to Rick Leland's roundabout way of getting to the heart of the Canal Zone sabotage plot . You'll also have to overlook the title , the movie never gets that far !
367777	2707735	38777	7.0	" I'll meet you half way , bring the frucci and leave the gucci here . "	I'm not a connoisseur of the Marx Brothers films , and therefore take delight in reading some of the reviews from other posters for this and other movies of theirs on this site . What I can say is that I enjoy their pictures , and " A Night in Casablanca " is no exception . With such a title , I might have expected more of a connection to the famous Bogart film ( my favorite of all time by the way ) , but then again , that wasn't important . Sure it had scheming Nazis and exotic looking sets reminiscent of Rick's ' Cafe Americain ' , but the letters of transit intrigue is replaced by the search for a missing Nazi treasure , and even then , it's the antics of Groucho , Chico and Harpo that take center stage . There might be fewer gags and one liners here than in their better hailed classics like " Duck Soup " , but things get off to a quick start with Harpo's ' holding up the building ' gag in an opening scene . Groucho , ever with an eye for the ladies , remarks on a rear view of Nazi accomplice Beatice Rheiner ( Lisette Verea ) - " That reminds me , I must get my watch fixed " . Later , appearing the worse for wear following some more commotion - " What happened , I was stood up by a woman and knocked down by a car . " I got a kick out of the clever gag using the center leafless table during the packing / unpacking scene , featuring almost everyone in the story . It would have been cool to have a cameo or two by some of the principals from Bogey's " Casablanca " like Sidney Greenstreet or Peter Lorre , but since that wasn't the case , you have decent support from Sig Ruman as undercover Nazi big wig Pfferrman / Stubel and Dan Seymour as Prefect Brizzard . Verea introduces " Who's Sorry Now ? " in a singing number , sounding very little ( at least to my tin ear ) like the hit Connie Francis would make of it . All in all , the film is an entertaining hour and a half , and a pretty good send off for the Marx Brothers .
368090	2707735	46414	7.0	" I just like to know who's making friends with my friends . "	Bogey himself called it a mess , but it's a delightful mess that doesn't spoil things by making it's characters go for outright comedy . The humor is in the cleverly written and subtly delivered lines , often catching up with you in the next scene and suggesting you hit the rewind button . The Alpha Video DVD I picked up probably offers a better copy than many reviewers in this forum have mentioned , I found it to be acceptable enough though slightly washed out . Bogart's character is Billy Dannreuther ( uniquely pronounced like the famed newscaster's name ) , married to Gina Lollobrigida , and in cahoots with an international band of swindlers . They must be up to no good according to Gwendolen Chelm ( Jennifer Jones ) , because after all , they don't even look at her legs . Gwen's husband Harry ( Edward Underdown ) fancies himself an upper crust Brit , who plays at it effectively enough to con the main hoods into thinking he's a member of landed gentry , instead of someone who's just landed . The crooks are a colorful lot , led by Robert Morley in what would have been the Sydney Greenstreet role if this were a class reunion . A dozen years since " The Maltese Falcon " seems to have filled out Peter Lorre's frame to ample proportions , while the rest of the evil quartet is rounded out by Ivor Barnard as The Galloping Major Ross , and Marco Tulli's Ravello . Each seem to have their own unique charm , except Ross , who relies on his swagger dagger a bit too much . While playing at international intrigue , the Dannreuther's and Chelm's also play at a little spouse swapping . You never completely figure out if Mrs . Chelm is off her rocker or not , but she describes herself best with - " I'm something of a witch , my old Spanish nurse said I could have been professional " . That's why the film's payoff with the bad guys led off in chains seems a bit forced , Gwendolen's soliloquy on her husband's disappearance sounds like the ramblings of a nut case . For reasons unknown , Bogey's character gets away with it , but what IT is , I don't know . " Beat the Devil " may be one of Bogart's quirkier films , but by no means his weirdest . On that score , I would point to " Swing Your Lady " and " The Return of Dr . X " , a bit hard to find since they're not commercially available . This one is at the far other extreme , a public domain film that can be found anywhere and everywhere , and worth the trouble of rounding up for it's offbeat cast and story .
367883	2707735	27113	7.0	" He who filters your good name steals trash . "	I'm always learning something new when I research a film on the IMDb , like how this Laurel and Hardy short was a sequel of sorts to " Them Thar Hills " . So now I'll have to search that one out to round out the experience . When I watch anything with Stan and Ollie in it today , I have to marvel at just what a pair of comic geniuses they were . As a kid , I always preferred Abbott and Costello , but I realize now that that with A & C , they did funny things , but Laurel and Hardy did things funny . As an example , just check out the timing involved whenever they leave Hall's grocery store and eat one of his cookies . They start out very simply and wind up after three or four tries in an increasingly complex choreography that's just brilliant to watch . There's also the misdirection with the pilfering customer in Stan and Ollie's electrical supply store , who starts out on foot and winds up hauling the entire store away in a moving van . With the boys none the wiser , they carry on their feud with Hall in an escalating series of comic encounters . And how about Ollie getting away with that line to Hall's wife coming down the stairs from the bedroom - " I've never been in a position like that before " . I would never have picked up on that double entendre as a kid , but boy oh boy , it was right out there in plain sight for the alert viewer to pick up on and and go ' huh ? ' . In any event , just about any Laurel and Hardy short offers as much entertainment as anyone else's full length feature , so taking in three or four at a time can only quadruple your fun . And by the way , why is it you never hear about alum any more ?
367911	2707735	466909	8.0	" My son is dead , I don't know who's son I'm raising . "	Mea culpa . I may be one of the few people on the planet who hasn't seen the original film , though that won't remain the case for long . Because the comparisons are inevitable , I'll have to make mine in reverse order , but for now I'll have to say that " The Omen " succeeds as a patently scary film , and decidedly superior to a lot of what passes for over the top in horror today . The part of Mrs . Baylock was a casting coup for the film , Mia Farrow handled it with such delicious intent . I would have gotten a bigger kick however if the name of Rosemary had come out of her resume . The hospital scene featured her in full malevolent glory , earning her the title of apostate from hell . I also found it intriguing the way she fed young Damien his dessert , sort of a strawberry communion ; did anyone else make that connection ? I generally don't fall for the jump scenes but this one had me going a few times . It helped that the attendant volume often approached blast level , thereby adding to the effect , but I would have liked to give it a try a little more subdued at times . Hey , did you think " The Shining " when little Damien made his appearance on the tricycle on the hard wood hallways ? It seems to me that Kate Thorn ( Julia Stiles ) could have found a safer way to water that plant . I caught a mini TV documentary on the casting of the movie and found it interesting that Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick literally beat out a field of a couple thousand to earn the Damien role . Down to the final two he nailed it in a screen test with that dourly menacing look throughout the story , capping it off with the smile to the viewer at the very end . But for my money , the most demonic look of all seemed to be the one on Liev Schreiber's face throughout the picture . One last note , a number of reviewers on this site mention Hurricane Katrina as one of the modern disasters shown as a precursor to the arrival of the anti-Christ . Sorry folks , that was the tsunami tidal wave that hit Sri Lanka .
368180	2707735	52311	8.0	" Just because he speaks a little guilty that don't make him innocent , you know ? "	I've only seen a few of Orson Welles ' pictures , the ones that count presumably - " Citizen Kane " and " The Stranger " . Without question , his presence in " Touch of Evil " earns him my esteem as one of the all time great actors . His presence literally fills the screen every time he appears , in part due to his considerable girth , but more so I think because of the intense characterization he imbues his portrayal with of police captain Hank Quinlan . Quinlan embodies the personification of the movie's title , and one would be hard pressed to think of another actor who could have done the job better . Fans of noir films may be surprised to see the cinema form elevated a considerable notch above it's traditional ' B ' movie platform here . From the intense cinematography to the expansive story straddling the Mexican American border , the picture reveals one sordid surprise after another as it rages across the screen . Yet at the same time , one must suspend a good measure of disbelief at some of the less credible elements that are offered in support of Mike Vargas ' ( Charlton Heston ) mission to solve a murder mystery . Virtually neglecting his wife ( Janet Leigh ) on their honeymoon to help investigate a case in which he has no jurisdiction is just the beginning . The way the new Mrs . Vargas handles herself in a handful of precarious situations simply defy anyone's definition of acting rationally in extreme circumstances . I just can't picture a real life scenario where a woman would openly challenge the supremacy of a mob boss on his home turf and expect to get away with it . All of which creates a unique dichotomy . One wants to consider that this could be one of the all time great mystery thrillers , but there are just too many significant distractions in the way . Yet it all falls into place by the time Quinlan is called upon to face the consequences of his own corruption . Which owes partly to the redemption of his partner Menzies ( Joseph Calleia ) , even as Menzies himself is brought down by events of the story . As for the role of Charlton Heston portraying a Mexican - I thought it worked once you get beyond the celebrity of the man himself and see him as police detective Vargas . Janet Leigh has the almost thankless task of the put upon newlywed who seems to be just a bit too understanding given the circumstances . I thought Marlene Dietrich brought a larger presence to the events in the story than her minimal screen time might have hinted at . However I was left scratching my head as to why Zsa Zsa Gabor was called upon to appear as a strip club owner if she was only going to be on screen for a literal blink of an eye . In summation , " Touch of Evil " is an oddly curious film , and depending on the frame of mind of the viewer , might be considered one of the best or one of the worst ever . For all it's flaws , I come down on the plus side for now , realizing that I really need to see this one again a few more times before I can say I'm a true fan . I'll just have to wait and see .
368035	2707735	43503	8.0	" If you're smart you can be a hero , if you're dumb you can be dead . "	You won't hear " The Enforcer " mentioned when it comes to Humphrey Bogart's body of famous work , but it's a very watchable mystery that pulls you in early , and keeps you interested with each new revelation . Bogie's character is Assistant District Attorney Martin Ferguson , who along with police pal Frank Nelson ( Roy Roberts ) , unravels a murder for profit enterprise in a deftly told story with a clever twist that finally sinks the big fish behind it . Like the Charlie Chan films of an earlier era , I found that keeping a scorecard for the colorful cast of characters is helpful to keep track of the action . You've got names like Big Babe , Philadelphia Tom , Smiley , Sad Eyes and Duke Molloy to keep track of , all as the story unfolds in a flashback within a flashback framework . One of the more interesting things for me in this 1950 film was it's explanation of the terms " contract " and " hit " , obviously recent additions to the crime lexicon for it's day , though hardly unknown today . The movie offers a lot of clichéd lines that were probably fresh at the time , take Ferguson's command to the paranoid Rico ( Ted De Corsia ) the day before he's set to testify against mob boss Mendoza ( Everett Sloane ) - " He'll die , he's got to die , and you're going to kill him . " Though Rico dies in a fall while trying to escape from testifying , we later see him in a flashback scene recounting how he was present at Mendoza's first " hit " of a café owner . Apparently , Mendoza's murder for hire racket had quite a few customers ; when Ferguson has the authorities dredge a swamp where a couple victims were expected to be found , they wound up with an evidence room table filled with the shoes of his victims . That was one of the credibility defying scenes that seemed a little over the top , even though done in understated fashion . With only a few hours to find a way to put Mendoza away for good , Ferguson strains his memory for a possible clue that may have been largely ignored when Rico initially gave himself up . I think they had a song for it - " Don't it make your brown eyes blue " . If you can get your hands on this little gem , give it a try . One of Bogie's last films , it holds up well , even though certain elements mentioned earlier mark it as a period piece . For all that , it offers a capable cast that delivers it's story well , amid dingy interrogation rooms and sordid back alleys . Have fun !
368053	2707735	462322	8.0	" Tonight , is a special night . "	Relentlessly outrageous and always over the top , " Grindhouse " is not a film for the masses , but if you go in knowing what to expect , this is one blast of a thrill ride start to finish . As a tribute to the sexploitation films of the Seventies , the movie is wildly successful in recreating the drive in movie experience of that era , complete with scratchy picture , missing reels and tons of gratuitous anatomical shots , if you know what I mean . Gory and violent too , to the point of squeamish if you have a weak stomach , but even then , it's in an effort to outdo itself in scene after scene . Now for the life of me , I couldn't really tell you what " Planet Terror " was supposed to be about . It's got mini scenarios about a feuding husband / wife doctor duo , a reuniting of former lovers ( Rose McGowan and Freddy Rodriguez ) , and lots of zombies . Bruce Willis turns up , but I can't say if he was a good guy or a bad guy . Lots of zombies too . There's so much going on , and one gets so mesmerized by Rose McGowan's amputated leg replaced by a stick and a machine gun that your rational mind has a little trouble keeping up with the sensory overload . Not to mention the zombies . The " Death Proof " segment is a bit more straightforward , and the title makes a whole lot of sense when put in context by Kurt Russell's character , Stunt Man Mike . Russell is maniacally effective as the thrill seeking lady killer , and the car chase scene has to be one of the best put to film . I could have done a lot less with the diner scene which seemed endless and virtually pointless , my mind straying to the one in Tarantino's " Reservoir Dogs " , which worked a whole lot better for it's relationship to that story . Before I forget , Russell gets to ham it up with a real cheesy John Wayne impersonation in the early going , way before the Challenger ladies turn the tables on him . Up front and in between , we're treated to four movie trailers and that instantly recognizable ' Feature Presentation ' music that was a mainstay of theaters back in the day . You couldn't get me to a drive in to watch any of this stuff when it was in it's prime , but today , reliving my youth , this stuff is a blast . The film gets a lot of mileage out of it's caricature of an era gone by , and that's the point , so you'll either get it or not get it , depending on your perspective . Oh yeah , my favorite grindhouse title of all time - " Sex Cures The Crazy " - never saw it , but still remember the title after almost forty years . Imagine the impact if I HAD seen it ! Hey , if you need a recommendation to see the film , I'll let Rosario Dawson's t-shirt tell the story - ' Badass Cinema ' - that's all you need to know .
367578	2707735	25878	8.0	" The murderer is right in this room , sitting at this table . . . , you may serve the fish . "	An eccentric inventor has disappeared and his mistress secretary has turned up dead , after admitting that she has taken fifty thousand dollars worth of bonds from his shop safe . Enter Nick and Nora Charles ( William Powell and Myrna Loy ) , newlyweds who get pulled into the case in between social gatherings and martinis - " A dry martini you always shake to waltzes " . This is the first entry in " The Thin Man " series , named for the gaunt and wiry inventor Clyde Wynant . All signs point to Wynant himself as the murderer , especially after two more victims turn up . But Nick Charles isn't buying it , there are too many suspects - Joe Morelli , a hood that Wynant catches in his secretary's apartment , Wynant's ex-wife Mimi ( Minna Gombell ) who's always asking for more money , her new husband Chris ( Cesar Romero ) , the suspicious Tanner , Wynant's bookkeeper , and Herbert MacCaulay , his lawyer . Seemingly uninterested in the case , Nick wryly digests the events that unfold following Wynant's disappearance , exchanging snappy banter with wife Nora . One is caught off guard when Nick actually slugs his wife to prevent her from catching a bullet from the gun of Morelli , who comes to the Charles apartment to plead his innocence . To catch the murderer , Nick invites all the suspects to a dinner party , where he methodically reveals what he knows , waiting for an opening for the real killer to expose himself . It's all delightfully done , and Nick doesn't miss a beat for a second . " The Thin Man " holds up exceedingly well for it's seventy plus years of age , and is a classic comedy / mystery achievement , showing up on many " best " lists . Do give it a try , and it may wind up on yours as well .
367557	2707735	34167	8.0	" That ain't no rookie , that's Buffalo Bill ! "	When you hear it said that truth is sometimes stranger than fiction , it's the story of " Sergeant York " that might have been the inspiration . I'd been on the lookout for this film for some time when it appeared today on Turner Classic Movies as part of a Veteran's Day tribute . I tried to picture the real life hero Alvin York on the battlefield amid enemy fire pulling off the ruse that led to the capture of one hundred thirty two enemy soldiers , and all because a superior officer ordered him to take charge . Perhaps he should have been ordered to win the war . I would like to have seen the real Alvin York , he must have been quite the extraordinary person . Not in a celebrity fashion , but in a deep spiritual sense , to have integrated his pacifist background with a sense of loyalty and brotherhood with his fellow soldiers . I can think of no other man you would want more in your corner when the chips are down and it's a matter of life or death . Gary Cooper's Best Actor Oscar was well deserved for his portrayal of Sergeant York . He's convincing throughout as he transforms York from a rabble rousing back woods country hick to a principled man of values and ideals . The scenes where he records his meager earnings in hopes of buying some fertile downland is nearly heartbreaking , made even more poignant when he later makes amends with the men who essentially betrayed him . Cooper is backed up with a fine supporting cast , but I have to admit I wound up chuckling a time or two when Walter Brennan's pastor character appeared . For some reason , those bushy black eyebrows called to mind an image of Groucho Marx that I just couldn't shake . Margaret Wycherly brings a matriarch's knowing instincts to the part of Mother York , somehow knowing that her son would eventually get his own patch of land someday , even when her own husband's experience seemed to suggest otherwise . It was somewhat surprising yet gratifying at the same time to learn that the real Alvin York shunned all attempts to cash in on his name and hero status in order to get back to his home and family responsibilities . When he finally relented to numerous requests to make a film of his war time achievements , he had only two conditions - that all of the proceeds go to religious charities , and that the actor to portray him would be Gary Cooper . I'd say he cut a square deal .
368419	2707735	482857	8.0	" Never use money to measure wealth , son . "	The previews for " Broken Trail " were incessant , and almost promised more than it could deliver . Hyping a ' limited commercial interruption ' format , that too seemed to go by the wayside after the first half hour or so each evening . Still , there was a lot to enjoy with the film , and a lot more to ponder given the grim circumstances of its ' participants and the fate of five young Oriental women plucked from their homeland and sold into a life of slavery and depravity . In my estimation , Robert Duvall cemented his acting career and reputation with the performance in " Open Range " . When you can't tell an actor is acting , completely transforming into the character he represents , then that's a pure joy to behold . Duvall has consummately mastered his craft , and having done so in a Western is uniquely gratifying , as this is my favorite film genre . Print Ritter's ( Duvall ) relationship with nephew Tom ( Thomas Haden Church ) starts out tenuously , though the uncle's argument about making a go of it is presented both as a challenge and an offer - " You ready buckaroo , let's do it ! " . One has the sense that there's something incomplete about Ritter's life ; bridging the gap between his deceased sister and her son is almost as much a mission as driving the herd to market . AMC is to be commended for it's choice of subject matter for their first attempt at a made for TV mini-series . I'll have to admit that I never even thought about the importation of Chinese women for the purpose of prostitution in the Old West . Given the brief moments of horror and inhumanity we're presented on screen , one can imagine that it must have been a thousand times worse for those who couldn't escape their circumstances . The poignancy of Ye Fung's ( Olivia Cheng ) situation after the brutal rape that leads to her suicide on the trail was probably the saddest part of the film , and yet an understandable option for one who has already crossed the ' eighteenth gate of hell ' . Almost every film offers an opportunity to learn something new ; how is it I had never heard of therapeutic papers before ? A hint for the uninitiated , they have no wood chips or splinters . Another compelling sidebar to the story was the exchange of two horses with the Crow Indians for crossing their land . Ritter's solution uniquely allowed for both parties to be winners in the trade . Aside from Duvall , the best casting decision in the picture has to be that of Rusty Schwimmer as Big Rump Kate . In her own way , she was every bit as ruthless and scary as " Deadwood's " Al Swearengen . The thought occurred more than once that her appearance in that series would be perfectly at home amid the mud and rabble . Not once in the previews I saw did " Broken Trail " hint at it's being based on a true story , so the commentary at the close of the film regarding the outcome of the participants seemed like a surprise ending . In fact , screen writer Alan Geoffrian researched little known histories of the Old West , incorporating them into the story of " Broken Trail " .

"	I wasn't aware of this Hitchcock ' true story ' until I ran across it today , and it proved to be an edgy and haunting film , especially when one realizes that it could happen to you . Watching it , I was drawn into Manny Balestrero's ( Henry Fonda ) ordeal , and not so much as a viewer , but as someone undergoing the excruciating uncertainty of what was going to happen if this mess wasn't straightened out . In that regard , the somber musical score adds even more tension to the grim story , and I felt myself getting almost suffocated by Manny's dilemma . You knew it was going to be different from the usual Hitchcock fare when the director appears before the movie to announce that the story was based on an actual event . Hitch's trademark cameo is noticeably absent , and that was by design . The almost documentary style of the film was entirely story boarded to the most minor detail , the way Hitchcock liked to work , so that by the time it got to filming it was almost like a bother to the director . Yet the end product is a haunting and moving story that's as effective as any of Hitchcock's best thrillers . Henry Fonda excels in his portrayal of Manny , coming across as your typical everyday Joe . He has a happy marriage and two kids he adores , but once caught up in the ordeal of finding a lawyer , looking for witnesses that will clear him , and working to pay off his growing debt load , his wife Rose ( Vera Miles ) slowly succumbs to depression and paranoia . The second half of the film in a way becomes her story , as her condition requires professional help and assignment to a sanitarium rest home . As somber as the tone of the story is already , Rose's declining mental stability would have been the straw to break most men in Manny's situation . The film makes use of overt Catholic symbolism with devices like Manny's rosary at the police station , and a picture of Jesus in the latter part of the story . Balestrero's faith is conveyed to be a factor in the resolution of his legal case , as the real thief that Manny was mistaken for is caught in the same neighborhood committing a similar crime . I thought it would have been much more vindicating for Manny to confront his original accusers the way he did the man who was arrested ; I certainly felt like lashing out at those two women for sending this man and his family into a living nightmare . It's not unusual that Alfred Hitchcock would find this real life story a fascinating topic for a movie , considering he dealt with fictional cases of mistaken identity in films like " North By Northwest " . All too well though , " The Wrong Man " is one of those stories that help assert the fact that truth sometimes , is stranger than fiction .
367551	2707735	42648	8.0	" We got you here Charlie , to tell you you've just been signed by our ball club . . . "	There's the great scene in " The Public Enemy " where Cagney leans against the lamppost in the rain , defining his character and persona as a force to be reckoned with . In " Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye " , it's the one where the oblique upward camera angle captures Ralph Cotter over the garage pit right after he dumps the body of Vic Mason ( Rhys Williams ) . It personifies the ' stark staring nuts ' quality of Cagney's character , ranking him right up there with Tom Powers and Cody Jarrett . The film skillfully weaves together strands of various sub plots to create a masterful gangster drama , even if it isn't as well known as Jimmy Cagney's premier movies . Teaming up Ward Bond and Barton MacLane as corrupt cops comes in stark contrast to their pairing in Bogart's " The Maltese Falcon " ; it never took much time for Inspector Weber ( Bond ) to cave in to Cotter's demands when it meant a bigger and bigger payoff . Somehow I don't think the cheesecake calendar in Weber's office would be deemed politically correct today . I'm a bit apprehensive over the Holiday Carleton character , I actually found her to be somewhat pathetic , particularly when she trades lip locks with Cotter after he slaps her around with a towel . Then again right after she manages to miss Cotter with all that kitchen artillery . For Cotter to be attracted to her didn't require much of a stretch though , he was as much a womanizer as a maniac . Here's a puzzler . When it was revealed that Ezra Dobson was the most powerful man in the state , and that he could get the goods on anyone within twenty four hours , how is it he didn't find out that there was no such person as Paul Murphy ? As mad as he was when he first discovered Cotter / Murphy and his daughter together , I wonder what he would have done if he hadn't caught the newlyweds fully clothed in separate beds . Even though a modern day remake of the film would find a way to eliminate those pesky plot points , I'm not sure you'll ever find a better gangster to take a powder on screen than Cagney's death scene here , in an ode to the movie's title ; it was brilliant . If one didn't know better , it looks like it might have reflected a personal experience . I wonder though , if an earlier line uttered by an off screen elevator operator was meant to reference Cotter's ultimate fate when he asked - " Going down ? "
368206	2707735	55824	8.0	" A type like that is an animal , so you've got to fight him like an animal , that's my advice . "	" Cape Fear " is an hour and a half long movie on a short fuse , ignited by Robert Mitchum's visceral portrayal of villain Max Cady , recently released from an eight year prison hitch for rape . The testimony of Sam Bowden ( Gregory Peck ) helped put him away , and for that exercise he's about to pay dearly . Now a lawyer , Bowden finds himself suddenly searching for intricacies in the law that will allow him and the authorities to keep Cady reigned in . But this is one clever fellow , and as a viewer , you find yourself wanting to reach right into the screen and wreak vengeance on Cady yourself , so despicable and smarmy is the character that threatens the peace and sanity of an otherwise charming Southern couple and their young daughter . Polly Bergen is Mrs . Bowden , and Lori Martin is young Nancy Bowden , who winds up being menaced for just about the entire film . In addition to the lead players , you've got some major Hollywood heavyweights lending their talents in supporting roles here ; Martin Balsam is Police Chief Dutton , and Telly Savalas with hair is private investigator Charles Sievers , hired by Bowden to learn Cady's intentions . A number of seamy scenarios are presented before Bowden succumbs to his baser nature , and hatches a plot to take out his aggressor with the tacit complicity of both . Cady won't go down easy though , and he remains a step ahead of Bowden at nearly every turn . When he makes his appearance on the houseboat and confronts Mrs . Bowden , the tension is palpable , and Polly Bergen's performance as she gasps for mercy is riveting . Soon enough though we learn that Cady's real objective is young Nancy , thereby extending the cat and mouse game into extra innings . As Cady emerges from the Cape Fear River drenched and oozing subdued hostility , director J . Lee Thompson draws us right into the action with a host of menacing camera angles , setting us up for the confrontation between the lawyer and the rapist . Their see saw battle is deftly handled ; Bowden's decision to go limp and pretend to be drowned allows sufficient time to gather his wits and fashion a weapon from a submerged rock . When the final reckoning comes due , you find yourself rooting for Bowden to pull the trigger , but his inner strength forces a decision to allow justice to take it's course . " Cape Fear " was remade some thirty years following the original with Robert DeNiro in the heel role , and Nick Nolte portraying lawyer Bowden . Interestingly , principals Gregory Peck , Robert Mitchum and Martin Balsam were called upon to play minor parts . Having seen the newer version first many years ago , I'll still tip my hat to the original black and white film of 1962 as my preference . Taking nothing away from the superb DeNiro , Robert Mitchum achieves an on screen menace almost effortlessly , endowing his character with a creepiness that infects every scene he's in ; he puts the fear into " Cape Fear " .
367872	2707735	79668	8.0	" Back off , dead men comin ' through . "	I can't really say why it took so long to get around to watching this film , it made critical waves when first released in 1979 , and I remember the controversy surrounding it . It's a harrowing story , more so for the aftermath of Detective James Campbell's ( Ted Danson ) murder and the withering descent into melancholia for his partner Karl Hettinger ( John Savage ) . For a petty hood , Greg Powell ( James Woods ) commands center stage in the story as he takes over his own criminal defense . In a brazen mockery of the judicial system , Powell puts his own parents ' on trial ' for the shortcomings of his adolescence . It's a scene that will make you want to scream . The movie has it's share of defining scenes beyond the actual murder . Besides the one mentioned above , you've got Christopher Lloyd's turn as a smarmy jail house lawyer as he counsels Powell's partner Jimmy Smith ( Franklyn Seales ) , and the first hint of Hettinger's slide into depression with the theft of a watch . Hettinger's subconscious desire to be punished for not doing his duty turns into a year long bout of kleptomania , eventually resulting in the loss of his position with the police department . He was fortunate to have a good wife at his side to provide support until the decision that resulted in a life sentence for the onion field killers was rendered . Watching " The Onion Field " will make you want to count your blessings . It's a disturbing film , suggesting that one never knows when a routine life might take a sudden turn that fractures all semblance of normalcy .
368037	2707735	34398	8.0	" Whoever is bitten by a werewolf and lives becomes a werewolf himself . "	Could there be a better movie to watch on Halloween Eve , other than the original " Dracula " perhaps ? Lon Chaney Jr . ' s portrayal as " The Wolf Man " earns him iconic status along with Universal's " Frankenstein " and the aforementioned role made famous by Bela Lugosi . Lugosi is present here as a gypsy fortune teller named Bela , with the forced diction of his earlier portrayal nearly gone . With a brief introduction to the subject of lycanthropy , or " werewolfism " , the story unfolds with wonderfully creepy fog enshrouded sets and logic defying werewolf history that almost makes sense within the context of the story . Bitten by a werewolf , the anguished Larry Talbot ( Chaney ) struggles with the knowledge and curse of becoming a werewolf himself , though others of saner persuasion continually enforce their doubts of the ancient gypsy curse , repeated with regularity throughout the film . As if to counterpoint the mental illness of lycanthropy , take note of the name on the store front next to Conliffe's Antique Shop , it's called Saneman Productions Ltd . Perhaps Talbot could have used their help ! " The Wolf Man " belongs on every horror fan's must see list ; it's story holds up well , along with the special effects that are obviously primitive by today's standards . Even so , the story of a man who turns into a werewolf as one of cinema's great horror themes gets it's best screen history send off in this classic film .
367974	2707735	114938	8.0	" He had found the band of jackals he needed . "	I've only recently become aware of this movie and had it on my short list of films to see at the first chance ; subscribing to the Encore Western channel just this week made the screening of the film feel like a sign on bonus . I always go into stories like this with the expectation that historical accuracy is an unknown concept , so in that regard , I don't come away disappointed . I have to say that this was an entirely entertaining film , with elements of story telling and filming technique that go beyond the formulaic and ordinary . As a fan of HBO's " Deadwood " , it's difficult not to make comparisons between that Western series and " Wild Bill " . I would like to have seen more of James Butler Hickok in " Deadwood " , but of course that wasn't the point of the show . Before getting to the meat of the story here , director Walter Hill provides a few quick glimpses at events in the life of the legendary gunfighter from his days in the Nebraska Territory of 1867 , up to his arrival in Deadwood Gulch in the summer of 1876 . The portrayal of the mining camp in both productions is effectively done , calling to mind the description Obi Wan Kenobi offered upon setting eyes on Mos Eisley - " You'll find no greater hive of scum and villainy " . Roughly paraphrasing the film's voice over narration , the town resembled that part in the Bible right before God gets angry . I'd say you pretty much have it right there for historical Deadwood . I would take it as a pretty safe bet that Wild Bill ( Jeff Bridges ) and Calamity Jane ( Ellen Barkin ) were never interrupted on a card table , but with it , the obligatory tease for story purposes was quickly consummated . With it too , the firm intention , yet not the resolve of Hickok's ultimate killer , Jack McCall . David Arquette would probably not have been my first choice for the role , catching me off guard with a passing resemblance to Emilio Estevez's Billy the Kid in " Young Guns " , and looking slightly better groomed than Garrett Dillahunt , who portrayed McCall in the ' Deadwood ' series . I liked the way the picture took hallucinatory turns with the black and white flashback scenes . They seemed to offer the perfect vantage point from which Hickok and the viewer could examine a troubled past and it's tumultuous incoherence . The most surreal one had to be when Bill recalled the duel with Will Plummer ( Bruce Dern in one of the best casting decisions of the film ) . It showed at least that Hickok had some sense of fair play in his make up , bringing himself down to the level of a cripple to even out the playing field so to speak . This will be a good one to catch a few more times to allow the bizarre nature of the film to sink in and mellow with familiarity . It definitely sets me in the direction of finding out more of the real life Wild Bill Hickok , a name that seems to grow in significance with each re-telling of the legend .
368106	2707735	23245	8.0	" Death . . . eternal punishment for anyone who opens the casket , in the name of Amon-Ra , King of the Gods . "	Boris Karloff follows up his exceptional 1931 performance as the Frankenstein Monster the following year in another Universal horror hit , " The Mummy " . In the film , Karloff portrays not only the title character Imhotep , but also his modern day counterpart Ardath Bey , whose mission is to reunite with his long lost love Princess Anck-Es-En-Amon . It was the 1921 British Museum Field Expedition that discovered the Mummy's remains along with the Scroll of Thoth , whose mystic message contains a spell that can raise the dead . When expedition member Norton ( Bramwell Fletcher ) unseals the scroll , the Mummy slowly comes to life in a sequence designed to create nightmares in young children and shivers in the timid . Fletcher's descent into madness is conveyed by a maniacal rant as his mind fails to accept what his eyes are showing him . His response to expedition leader Sir Joseph Whemple - " He went for a little walk , you should have seen his face " . Fast forward to 1932 , Sir Joseph and son Frank return to Egypt , and aided by Ardath Bey , discover the tomb of Imhotep's lost love of 3700 years prior . In ritual prayer , Bey summons the spirit of Anck-Es-En-Amon to seek life in the body of Helen Grosvenor . As Helen slowly succumbs to her new identity , Imhotep uses his mystical powers to remove his opposition , willing Sir Joseph's demise and nearly doing the same to Frank . In an illuminating sequence , it's revealed how Imhotep came to be buried alive for his sacrilege of stealing the sacred Scroll of Thoth , and memorizing it's prohibited secrets . For fans of classic horror and Universal monsters in particular , the names of Frankenstein , Dracula and Wolf Man will always remain the big three , but that in no way can lessen the importance of " The Mummy " when it comes to one's must see list . Boris Karloff would have been considered legendary for either one of his signature characters , to have portrayed both Frankenstein and The Mummy so effectively is significant testimony to his " monstrous " talent .
368342	2707735	116282	9.0	" . . . and I guess that was your accomplice in the wood chipper . . . "	It's funny how the simple word " Yaaah " sounds so dimwitted in the movie , yet turns out to be one of the few affirmations of normalcy in a maelstrom of frenzied lunacy . " Fargo " is the quintessential film of how a bad idea can only get badder ( worse ? ) when put in the hands of inept bunglers who can just about taste a big payday . What happens to them is a sort of poetic justice , but there's nothing as lyrical or pretty as poetry going on here . Here's a movie where you can't picture any of the principals being portrayed by anyone else . It's the perfect meld of characters , dialog and situations that domino from one disaster to another with eerie precision , and the unsettling feeling that yes indeed , as nuts as it all is , this is something that could actually happen . For whatever reason , I haven't seen a lot of the Coen Brothers pictures . I came across " The Big Lebowski " a couple of weeks ago , and decided to catch this film today to keep the streak going . I'm suitably impressed by their quirky characters and bizarre , colorful plots to keep on going . Bitingly original , they leave one somewhat disturbed , but curious for more . Frances McDormand , William H . Macy and Steve Buscemi are stand out in their roles here , but except for a few brief minutes shared by Macy with each of them , their characters never really appear together . Chalk it up again to the story tellers who move things along in spite of the hapless Jerry Lundegaard , someone we can all relate to whenever things we can clearly see in our head just don't quite turn out the way they're planned . Poor Jerry , he never even came close ; kind of makes you wonder how he ever became the executive sales manager . Say , I wonder if Gaear ( Peter Stormare ) got his inspiration from Paul Bunyan ?
368575	2707735	29843	9.0	" The man who wins the Golden Arrow will be Robin Hood " .	The word that comes to mind in describing " The Adventures of Robin Hood " is rollicking - it's just a rollicking good time from start to finish . I was most impressed with it's brilliant use of Technicolor cinematography and the dazzling displays of swordsmanship , with many action sequences well placed from start to finish . As others have mentioned , it's hard to picture anyone else in the role of the title character other than Errol Flynn , so it was a surprise to learn that Warner Brothers ' first choice for the lead was James Cagney . Cagney however played hardball with the studio , so they went with the actor who made such a splash in 1935's " Captain Blood " . I tried picturing Cagney in the green tights and involuntarily began to chuckle at the image , but Flynn and his cohorts seemed to look ideal in their outfits . Flynn's natural athleticism is certainly on display here ; the scene that really surprised me was the one where he grabbed the rope of the castle gate , the weight of which hauled him to the top of the barricade as he scrambled up for an even better vantage . I guess it could have been a stunt double , but it sure was an impressive maneuver . I recall seeing a documentary on Steven Spielberg stating that he took some of his inspiration for the ' Star Wars ' franchise from pirate and adventure flicks of the 1930's . That's certainly evident in the light saber scenes we're all familiar with , but what I noticed here was how much the hooded cloaks of the Jedi Knights might have been modeled after the garb of King Richard the Lion-Heart and his men . Something to think about . I've seen Basil Rathbone before primarily in his portrayal of detective Sherlock Holmes , and only in black and white pictures of the era . So again , it surprised me to see how robust and athletic he was in this picture . It adds another dimension to my appreciation of the actor outside of the stereotype . He also mixed it up pretty well with Flynn in the action sequences , until his demise at the hand of the film's hero in the finale . Then of course there's Olivia de Havilland as Maid Marian , understated in her charm and beauty in contrast to the way the role might be cast and played in a film made today . A bit of trivia I've always remembered about this picture involves Maid Marian and the horse she rides . A sturdy palomino , it's name was Golden Cloud , and appeared in this film uncredited . That may sound odd , but that same steed went on to become the ' Smartest Horse in the Movies ' as the partner of none other than Roy Rogers .
367984	2707735	67185	9.0	" Oh my , how the world still dearly loves a change . "	With one of the most surreal opening sequences ever , " Harold and Maude " goes on to create a unique black comedy , uncharacteristically teaming up teenager Harold Chasen ( Bud Cort ) with an older woman . Not the kind of older woman found in " The Graduate " , but a nearly eighty year old free wheeling free spirit named Maude , convincingly portrayed by Ruth Gordon . Together they form a symbiotic relationship that proves both charming and unnerving , as Harold searches for the meaning of life , and Maude does nothing more than show him how to live it . Once you get past Harold's first two suicides , the rhythm of the movie switches gears slightly , focusing now and then on Mrs . Chasen's ( Vivian Pickles ) attempt to hook up her son with prospective wives utilizing a computer dating service that screens out the fat and ugly . With composure equal to the task , Harold convincingly asserts his preference to remaining single with almost comic results if his tactics weren't so gruesome . You have to pay attention to Mom's answers for the dating questionnaire , it's about the funniest deadpan you'll ever hear . All the while the picture utilizes an effective Cat Stevens soundtrack , the songs appropriately selected for the scenes they play against . They would have worked better for me had Stevens never endorsed the Ayatollah Khomein's call for the death of novelist Salman Rushdie , but that's another story . Stevens ' music strikes just the right melancholy , interspersed among assorted funerals , manic car cruises and a display of inspired lunacy between the title characters to thwart a military induction for Harold . In the end , " Harold and Maude " is a life affirming film that takes a road less traveled to convey it's lessons . Not entirely believable of course , but then the film would have lost some of it's quirky power and resonance . Also not for every taste , but for anyone eager to ' greet the dawn with a breath of fire ' , the film has enough going for it to recommend at least a single viewing .
368358	2707735	346156	9.0	" It's only a movie Mr . Paley , I'll bring you some popcorn . "	But Oh ! , what a movie it is ! Taking it's inspiration from the Golden Age Comics and pulp fiction of the 1930's and 40's , " Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow " is a lavish and luscious film from the mind and talent of newcomer director Kerry Conran . It's got all the super-heroics , nefarious villains , city stomping robots and mechanical marvels one could ask for , and then some . As Sky Captain Joe Sullivan , Jude Law is an unlikely but convincing hero in his bomber jacket and flight garb . Gwyneth Paltrow is simply gorgeous as fearless reporter Polly Perkins , the sepia rendered tones of the opening half of the movie adding to her beauty and mystery . She has a thing for Joe , and you know the cattiness will erupt when aviatrix Frankie ( Angelina Jolie ) makes her appearance , referring to Polly as the " competition " . After all the movies ever made , it's virtually impossible to come up with a totally original concept . With Sky Captain , the evil scientist bent on destroying the world and recreating a new one based on his own vision has been done before , yet here it seems amazingly refreshing . Even the clichéd lines fit when they're needed . The film takes place in a futuristic 1939 . For me , the visuals presented for some of today's still surviving consumer products were a real treat - Dubble Bubble , Spearmint Gum and Coca-Cola . And though many will bemoan the intrusion of CGI in today's top blockbusters , the seamless quality of the effects in this film is a marvel ; case in point , watch as Sky Captain and Polly make their way into the underground city of the villain Tottenkopf . The bats that fly past them look as real as an actual colony . With 2004 coming to a close , this is the most fun I've had at a film this year . The story , the characters , the gorgeous filming and virtual non stop action made for an exciting afternoon . Not to mention the humor ; one of the running gags has Polly losing her film equipment , leaving her with only a camera and two shots left . Unintentionally wasting one in a near miss getaway scene , she's only got one left for just the right moment - she'll know it when she sees it . It comes at the end of the film , the awe and grandeur of a veritable Noah's Ark of creatures saved from destruction in the background . She frames the camera on the battered but smiling face of Sky Captain , and he answers the only way he can after she snaps the picture - " lenscap " !
368572	2707735	42041	9.0	" Made it Ma , top of the world ! "	OK , so here's a question - who killed Ma Jarrett ? Big Ed ( Steve Cochran ) terrorizes Verna ( Virginia Mayo ) by stating that he'll tell Cody Jarrett ( James Cagney ) how she shot Ma in the back . But because Verna gets to Cody first , she tells him the same story , but with Big Ed the perpetrator . I believe most viewers of the film take it on faith that Verna did it , but I think the story leaves enough room to consider that it could have gone otherwise . In it's way , the movie creates the same kind of dichotomy as another of Cagney's famous gangster films , " Angels With Dirty Faces " . Did Rocky Sullivan die a yellow rat or did he do it for Father Jerry ? It can be endlessly debated , and depending on your point of view , either scenario is possible . That's one of the reasons this is such a great film . Certainly , it's one of Cagney's greatest performances , and he goes at it with gusto . The jail house mess scene when he learns Ma is dead is Cagney at his maniacal best , improvising as he goes leaving even director Raoul Walsh guessing where it's heading . One wonders if it's one of those headache attacks that Jarrett's suffered ever since his father died , or the actualization of a sentiment he later shares with inmate Pardo / Fallon ( Edmond O'Brien ) - " Maybe I AM nuts " . Hey , wasn't Margaret Wycherly great as Ma Jarrett ? Couldn't you just picture her in a Texas Death Match against Margaret Hamilton's Wicked Witch of the West from " The Wizard of Oz " ? You believe it when she says of Big Ed - " Anytime I can't handle his kind , I'll know I'm getting old . . . " It's a testament to Cagney's portrayal that even as the film's protagonist , you don't identify with him enough to want to see him get away with it . He casually guns down a railroad engineer in an early scene because the man remembered and spoke Cody's name . Later he gives new meaning to the term ' ventilate ' when he airs out the stuffy trunk that contains Parker , one of Big Ed's inside men at the penitentiary . By the time the film builds up to the explosive finale , you come to see that Verna was right - you can pump him full of lead and he'll still keep coming at you . Say , did anyone make a connection when the radio broadcast of the train robbery made reference to the ' High Sierra ' tunnel ? That's another film that comes to mind when considering the great ones of the ' s gangster era , along with Edward G . Robinson's " Little Caesar " ( 1931 ) and Cagney's own earlier work , " Public Enemy " from the same year . Of them all , Cagney's Cody Jarrett is undeniably the most vicious and tortured villain of the lot .
367560	2707735	118607	10.0	" Where you almost mean what you say ? Where laws almost work ? How can you live like that ? "	Another reviewer on this board made a good point ; history classes in the 1950's and 60's were quite devoid of true life cases that helped shape American politics and policies prior to the Civil War . In my case , it was as if not much occurred between the presidencies of Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln , with names like Van Buren , Harrison , Tyler , Polk and Fillmore relegated to the dustbin of history . As we learn in the " Amistad " story occurring in 1839 , the country was already bracing for a conflict over the slavery question . Senator John C . Calhoun ( Arliss Howard ) was flexing his oratory muscles for debate on the issue , and the scene where he challenges President Van Buren ( Nigel Hawthorne ) at the dinner table is particularly compelling . The performances as well as the film itself appear award worthy , and the movie seems to have been overlooked somewhat in that regard . In a year when " Titanic " was destined to overwhelm in terms of sheer spectacle , I find it hard to imagine that a title like " The Full Monty " was deemed more worthy than this . I suppose that shouldn't really surprise followers of the Academy Awards , as recognition doesn't always follow quality . Speaking of performances , this is one film where the actors dissolve into their characters better than most across the board . Matthew McConaughey acquits himself well as lawyer Baldwin , and Djimon Hounsou is riveting as the slave Cinque . I would have liked to see Morgan Freeman delivering more power to the story , but within the parameters he was given , he's solid as ever . The tour de force portrayal of course is given by Anthony Hopkins as former president John Quincy Adams , his speech before the Supreme Court is mesmerizing to help turn the tide for the slaves on trial . Brilliantly done . It was also interesting to note how newspapers of the era were as editorially slanted as those of the present day . When we see the first pass of the New Haven newspaper regarding the slaves of the Amistad , the caption reads ' Massacre At Sea ' . Quite different from the way sympathetic readers would eventually get to see it - ' Freedom Fight At Sea ' . In all aspects , the film brilliantly conveys the innate resonance and power of language .
367922	2707735	76759	10.0	" May the Force be with you . "	I couldn't let the thirtieth anniversary season of " Star Wars " slip by without a commemorative viewing today to remind me of the start of this hugely successful franchise . Though it's not one of my own personal Top Ten films of all time , I can understand how so many fans come to see it that way . At the time it was a seminal film that reinvigorated the sci-fi genre ; my first viewing when it debuted in theaters garnered more than a single ' Whoa ' with each new scene and concept that hadn't been done before . I was particularly intrigued with the names of the characters George Lucas created for his heroes , sounding uniquely original and matching their physical description and characters . Could Luke Skywalker , Han Solo , or Princess Leia have been called anything else ? How about Jabba the Hutt ; he looks exactly how a Jabba the Hutt would look if there was a Jabba the Hutt . Makes sense , doesn't it ? I get a kick out of the nay sayers on this board who have such a fierce guttural reaction to the success of the entire Star Wars franchise , never missing an opportunity to thrash it unmercifully . The best response to that I guess would be that they represent a mere six and a half per cent minority of the IMDb voting history for this film that give it less than a 6 . 0 rating . It reminds me of that joke about the one in three people who might be crazy , and your two best friends seem alright . Something to think about . Anyway , there's no point in detailing the film since virtually every one on the planet has probably seen it at least once , even my wife . My son , who was born in 1977 , has probably seen it thirty times a year every year since he started watching movies , kind of a record in itself I would think , allowing him to quote virtually every line of dialog from the movie . Such is the compelling nature of true Star Wars fans , who while watching , find themselves in a galaxy far , far away .
367803	2707735	68699	10.0	" Well it's what people know about themselves inside that makes ' em afraid . "	I'm perfectly willing to allow Clint Eastwood his pronouncement of ambiguity regarding the character of ' The Stranger ' , and have read with interest the many opinions offered in the reviews and threads on this site . I've seen the movie at least a half dozen times over the years , but today it was with the express intent of crystallizing my opinion . As I've felt all along , the character of The Stranger is indeed a mortal man , the brother of the slain town marshal Jim Duncan , and I'll get into that in a minute . Let's keep in mind that Eastwood himself has had quite some time to reflect on his direction and portrayal in the film , and the subject of a ghostly apparition had time to take hold of viewer consciousness . The film itself has added to the controversy , at least twice via statements made by hotel owner Lewis Belding ( Ted Hartley ) . The first time occurs right after he supervises the evacuation of his hotel , remarking disparagingly to the Preacher ( Robert Donner ) - " . . . they're emptyin ' my whole hotel , throwing out paying guests right into the street just to make room for our new guardian angel " . Later , when addressing Lago's citizens at a town meeting right after the dinner scene with The Stranger and Callie - " . . . couldn't be worse if the devil himself had ridden right into Lago " . So right there you have the seeds planted for both an avenging angel and a demon bent on revenge . There IS a real mystery to the film , but it's not the identity of ' The Stranger ' . To fully understand , it's important to view the movie in it's unedited form via tape or DVD . Watching " High Plains Drifter " on TV , even a cable channel leaves too much out , particularly in the way of dialog , and especially regarding the character of Callie ( Marianna Hill ) and her relationship to the people in the town . The movie offers two flashback scenes , the first by ' The Stranger ' only about twenty minutes into the story , the second by Mordecai ( Billy Curtis ) , again shortly after the evacuation of the hotel guests . In both flashbacks , one is able to recognize every citizen of Lago that we already know by name , EXCEPT ONE . About midway in each scene , a character is shown entering from , and then retreating back into the shadows , with half of a bearded face visible . It's the face of The Stranger . The reason Eastwood's character can recall with clarity what occurred on the night Marshal Duncan was killed is because he was there . The mystery then becomes why he was powerless at the time to intervene on his brother's behalf . Presumably he wasn't a citizen of Lago , or he would be recognized , so there must have been another reason for him to be there . Visiting his brother , certainly , but for reasons unknown and unexplored , ' The Stranger ' did not become involved at the time of his brother's death . The one person who had an inkling to The Strangers ' identity I feel , was Sarah Belding , making reference to the dead marshal in an unmarked grave . But The Stranger wasn't biting , he intended to remain anonymous , a position he affirmed when he first checked into Belding's hotel and didn't register . Sure he could have used a phony name , but then some of the mystique he was attempting to establish would have been compromised . I'm quite intrigued reading some of the threads maintaining certainty regarding The Stranger being a ' spirit ' citing reactions the character has , as if one could actually know how a spirit would go about his business . But since we're playing that game , I'd offer two reasons why he couldn't be a spirit or a demon . On the ride into town , The Stranger's reflection is shown on one of the store front windows as he goes past . Then in the first bar scene , The Stranger's arm casts a shadow on the wall as he takes his beer . Granted , most of my spirit and demon lore has come from other movies and popular literature , but I believe that both of those occurrences aren't possible with beings from the other side . What REALLY intrigues me now is if Eastwood was clever enough to consciously plant those things in the film to keep everyone and his brother ( no pun there ) guessing . Oh , and one last thing - if The Stranger really WAS a ghost , then who's ghost was the horse he rode in on ? When I first entered a rating for this film on IMDb , I gave it a strong ' 8 ' as one of the upper echelon film Westerns , right up there with " High Noon " , " Shane " , and Eastwood's own " Unforgiven " . However now , after having so much fun watching and re-watching the movie , and reading some of the great discussion on this site , that has to warrant at least two bonus points , I'm re-establishing my rating as a ' 10 ' .

367771	2707735	350258	10.0	" I'm gonna make it do what it do , baby . . . Yeah ! "	" Ray " is a triumphant , inspiring , yet unflinching glimpse into the life of Ray Charles Robinson , a brilliant song writer and musician for over fifty years until his recent passing prior to this movie's release . Ray , whose professional name became Charles in deference to boxer Sugar Ray Robinson , rode a tumultuous journey on his rise to stardom , due to escalating drug use and womanizing that even though it marred his character , did not detract from his enormous talent and business acumen . Jamie Foxx gives a truly admirable performance of the musical genius , right down to the look and mannerisms , I'm sure his role will garner Academy Award recognition , even if only a nomination . Other standouts include Kerry Washington as wife Della Bea , Aunjanue Ellis as Mary Ann Fisher , and Regina King as Margie Hendricks , lead singer of the Raelettes . Washington in particular challenges her flawed husband to face up to his demons , ultimately succeeding when Charles enters drug rehab to put his heroin addiction and guilt over his younger brother's childhood death behind him . Regina King is also compelling as Hendricks , whose soulful gaze for Charles when she falls in love with him is replaced by scorn , especially evident in the tune that was inspired by their breakup - " Hit the Road , Jack " . In it's somewhat documentary style , " Ray " successfully integrates social commentary along with entertainment , as we see how segregation held blacks inferior well into the 1960's . Charles ' 1979 recognition by the state of Georgia for it's prior disregard for his music and achievement is duly noted in the film . As far as films about music entertainers goes , this movie is richer and far superior to those of Charles ' earlier contemporaries Buddy Holly ( The Buddy Holly Story ) , and Richie Valens ( La Bamba ) . The songs chosen for the film , all sung by Charles himself , are a memorable tribute to the man who created them .
