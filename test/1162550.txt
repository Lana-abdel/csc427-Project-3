520904	1162550	277371	1.0	there's sophomoric humor , there's brain-dead humor . . . and then there's this	When 5 writers get credit for one awful teen movie parody , you're in trouble . When the Director of said movie also did not one , but two Ellen DeGeneres specials you're in real big trouble . By the way , why parody teen movies when most of them seem to be parodies themselves ? Not Another Teen Movie ( or NATM for morons who can't spell or just love acronyms ) is one of the most brain-dead " comedies " I have ever had to misfortune of watching . And " Freddy got Fingered " came out the same year . 2001 had way too much tragedy and we went to the movies to help us forget our woes and THEY give us this horse manure . I openly weep . Why Mr . T had ANYthing to do with this I have not a clue . There's more movie after the credits , but if you can make it that far , you're a better man than I .

521284	1162550	338325	1.0	brainless action without the action part of that equation	Bo Laramie , a rising Hollywood star , unaccustomed to the EVIL paparazzi and their EVIL ways , have to combat the EVILness when he stops in the middle of a busy highway and causes a fatal car accident , but only because of those EVIL paparazzi , did I forget to say they're EVIL ? ? Well don't worry , this movie will pound that point into your head too . It's hard to know where to start with this one . Do I rag on how some things can be painted black and what , but Paparazzi are NOT high on that list . Do I mention Dennis Farina's poor man's Columbo impersonation in the film ? or do I talk about the excessive and totally needless reliance on celebrity cameos ( Vince Vaughn , Chris Rock , Matthew McConaughey , Mel Gibson himself , anyone from the E ! channel ) . Speaking of E ! , do I mention the laughable sequence when they're portrayed as hard hitting news journalists ? Or do I just offer the cursory statements of how awful the acting , story , and " plot logic " were ? As you can see , I'm in quite the pickle here . So many bad things to point out , so little time . I'll merely settle on telling you that the movie stinks and leave it at that . I think I've gotten my point across somehow .
519488	1162550	382910	1.0	simply atrocious	Shot on the ( very ) cheap , the futuristic spaghetti western about various people trying to get their hands on a cargo of something is marred by hideously awful acting , bland generic dialog , laughably sad special effects , and absolutely nothing that could feasibly be construed as entertaining in the least . If you only had 24 hours to live , then and ONLY then consider watching this because it'll make 90 minutes feel like an eternity . My god , I'd prefer almost any of those crappy ' originals ' on the Sci-Fi channel to this piece of garbage . Everyone involved in this production should be just hanging their respective heads in shame right about now . ( and YES that last part is a joke , just to fill the required 10 lines )
519720	1162550	126098	1.0	so bad	The film starts with a mail woman ( Kitten Natavidad of Russ Meyers fame , who thankfully isn't nearly as worn-down and haggard looking as she is in " The Double-D Avenger ) , spying on the amazing Ginger Lynn being screwed by Harry Reems who won't stop saying dumb s # @ t , so the scene is not erotic . The couple is mailed two tickets for an island stay in a mansion where an unknown person is killing off the guests in this porn who ( cares ) done it . For a film that was filmed during porn's " Golden Age " ( albiet towards the end ) this film is still a disappointment . Plus , seeing Lisa De Leeuw with the foreknowledge that she died from AIDS is very depressing . Furthermore seeing a man masturbate using a turkey is not appealing in the least . My Porn
521271	1162550	325455	1.0	see girl run , see girl throw up , see girl hate Ice cream , see audience member fall asleep	I was Luke-warm to the Director's " Rubber's Lover " and have yet to see " Pinocchio 964 " ( I do own it , so it's just a question of when I can find the time to view it ) . But I digress , this short film is less of a story , than a series of random events just strung together and tedious events at that . A crazy girl running , throwing up , spitting out ice cream , screaming , etc , etc . . Note to self , when live action people throw up for minutes on end it's silly , but when puppets do it ( Ie . " Team America " ) it's hilarious . This 12 minute short film can be found on Unearthed's DVD of " Rubber's Lover "
521360	1162550	60712	1.0	no one wants to hear strippers talk . . . NO ON	A 4 minute campy tour of San Francisco gives way to the inner thoughts of the girls who appear in the Russ Meyer films and other strippers ( as if we give a hoot about what they have to say , just shut up dance and look pretty . You're strippers dammit , not brainy philosophers ) , footage of Meyer's own " Europe in the Raw " , as well as screen test footage of of Lorna Maitland in Russ Meyer's " Lorna " Probably my forth least favorite Russ Meyer's film , ahead of " Pandora Peaks " and his two Studio films ( " Beyond the Valley of the Dolls " and " The Seven Minutes ) No plot , dancings OK , but WAY too much yakkity yak .

Then Sara falls for the murdered guy's twin brother's charms . One of the worse soft-core porns that I've watched . And if you read any of my other reviews , you know that I'm not one prone to hyperbole . The sex scenes arn't erotic in the least , no moaning , and to top it off they're all cut short .

The Goods : 9 Sex Scenes not even full scenes ( M / F , F / F , M / F / F ) , inerracial , nude modelingBabe of the Movie : Lorraine Spaughton , because she's hot AND she gets murdered within the first 5 or so minutes , so you can watch her sex scene & change the channelWhere I Saw It : Showtime Too
520539	1162550	121113	1.0	putrid	This very unfunny failed TV Pilot can be found as an extra on the 30th Annivesery DVD Special Edition " Blazing Saddles " . Imagine the movie without the satire , humor , or writing skills . But with all the trappings of a typical lame ' 70's sit-com show complete with obtrusive laugh track and you'll still have no clue how sheer putrid this failed show was . What the hell was Lou Gossett Jr . thinking when he signed onto this disaster ? ? This was possibly the worst thing he's been in ( and yes I'm including the first " Punisher " movie and " Iron Eagles 3 " . Steve Landesberg , I understand as he can't say no to crap .
521194	1162550	86119	1.0	mind-numbingly awful	Roommates Sugar and Bobby Lee are abducted by menacing dudes while out shopping one day and taken back to a secluded island that the girls reluctantly tell the thugs that they last visited when they were ten years of age and that a fortune is located on . All that just pretty much bookends a movie that is pretty much one long flashback about the girls first visit to the island and subsequent fight with a cannibalistic family . This one is extremely horribly acted by everyone involved to the point that I started feeling bad for poor Hank Worden who truly deserved much MUCH better . As much as I didn't like " Barracuda " ( that's on the same DVD ) I have to admit that this film makes that one look like Citizen Kane . Eye Candy : one pair of tits ( they might belong to Kirsten Baker ) Dark Sky DVD Extras : Vintage ads for various drive-in food ; and Trailers for " Bonnie's Kids " ( features nudity ) , " the Centerfold Girls " , " Part-time Wife " ( features nudity ) , " Psychic Killer " , & " Eaten Alive " .

One night she records a senator ( who's a republican of course , if these things where true to life it'd been a democrat more then likely , but thats a whole different rant ) , anyways she records a senator with a callgirl ( Regina Russell ) and has to contend with an editor who steals it . The sex scenes aren't all the great , the plot boring . Skip this one .

521083	1162550	451085	2.0	' special ' effects on par with " the Thing Below "	With so-called ' special ' effects that may very well rival " the Thing Below " , this tale of giant intelligent bugs that terrorize sorority girls is bad in every possible way . The acting's awful , the plot's overtly stupid , and the aforementioned special effects make the whole thing laughable , if not for the fact that you'll be too depressed that you've wasted about an hour and a half on this garbage . Even nudity can't save this from falling into the abyss of the dreaded DVD bargain bin . Not that bargain can be used in any connotation when referring to this movie . No matter which way you slice it , simply dreadful . Good thing that Director Jeffery Lando holds three citizenships , become this film ( and his others ) are so bad that his American should be revoked . Eye Candy : the unfortunately named Chris Guy shows everything she's got ; Rhonda Dent shows T & A ; Anna Farrant and Natalia Tudge just show tits
521429	1162550	784984	2.0	the deepening ineptness	After an extremely badly lit double murder we move on to the meat of the movie , Ted ( Director Ted Alderman ) is a firefighter whom transfers out of New York to a small town , after stress from gets to him . Jim ( writer / co-director Jim O ' Rear ) is the only fellow firefighter who befriends him while the others think he's damaged goods . Not to soon afterwords those close to Jim start to die by the hands of a killer in firefighter gear . Tieing this low-budget slasher to the events of is supremely tacky at best , so the less said of that plot point the better . The acting , while lousy , is somewhat forgivable given the sub-genre , but the mystery of who the killer is is painfully obvious from the get go and no amount of nudity ( Jim beds the majority of girls in the cast , good use of writing / co-directing there ) or blood can keep the boredom of the film from creeping in . Also there was a 2 to three minute conversation in the film where the soundtrack totally overwhelmed the talking for no discernible reason whatsoever , that was just plain annoying . Eye Candy : Maria Kil shows boobs , butt & bush ; Christy McMahan , Debbie D , Debbie Rochon , Latrice Shokunbi , & Lanee Landry get topless Where I saw it : Netflix online via Xbox 360
520220	1162550	902280	2.0	one of the worst games I beat twice	Xbox 360's achievement point system is both a blessing and curse . When you become addicted you can find great games that normally you wouldn't have given a chance . On the flip side you also play a lot of fairly awful games , This cheaply made movie cash in being squarely in the latter category . A lackluster storyline , awful static camera ( it's fixed , and you can't control it at all ) , VERY limited replayability , and it being so damn easy all combine in a sea of banality that you'll dislike as much as I . Definitely not worth a buy and barely worth a rent ( due to the aforementioned achievement points , which are beating the game on normal , hard , and finding the one secret egg per level ) . It may not be E . T landfill bad , but it's close . I got 1 , , 000 easy points from the ' game ' but lost a piece of my sanity . My total 360 Gamerscore : 47226 out of a possible 84270
521214	1162550	427688	2.0	Dora the explorer ( of really crappy kills )	After a quasi-Gothic , all-fruity music video , the movie starts with Cassidy the lead singer killing herself . In a perfect world that would be that and the end credits would roll . We don't live n that world . The insipid band members decide to go to some clown to contact her dead essence . When I say clown , I mean actual clown . He tell them they're all going to die via Cassidy's ghost ( the spirit possesses Dora , one of the band-mates ) We couldn't care less as the characters are all boring , vapid , and extremely horribly acted . Written by Adam Hackbarth ( an incredibly apropos surname if there ever was one ) , and directed by Corbin Timbrook ( who after The attendant , and Tower of blood , HAS to know that he keeps making crap for a living ) , this movie s a constant battle between the film's incompetence and the viewer's need to stay awake . Not enough blood to appease gore-hounds , nor enough nudity to satisfy pervs . This movie in fact has absolutely nothing to recommend to absolutely anyone . Eye Candy : Amanda Carraway gets topless Where i saw it : Starz on Demand
519643	1162550	113762	2.0	Why does the talented Englund continue to sign on for Tobe Hooper's crap ? ? ? ?	Wow , talk about an extremely apropo tag-line as indeed there IS a fate worse than death and that fate would revolve around having to watch this film ( or its unfathomable two sequels ) about a killer laundry folding machine that enjoys eating people . Horrible in nearly every aspect and isn't even unintentially funny , so the one enjoyment that could have been had is taken away from us . This was the worst thing I saw Robert Englund in since an episode of the inappropriately misleadingly titled " Masters of Horror " , funnily enough THAT was directed by Tobe Hooper as well . And I won't even mention " Night Terrors " . Mr . Englund , you're an amazing actor , now PLEASE never collaborate with Hooper ever EVER again , he's dragging you down , man . As for why I'm giving this more than just one measly star is ONLY to convey that " Troll 2 " is STILL the worst movie ever made . Where i saw it : Cinemax

Featuring interviews with various cast and crew members their's a lot of pathetic comments thrown around like how the film would be a " smart Porky's " which is sacrilege as far as I'm concerned as Porky's is and always will be a classic , whereas Mallrats isn't and never will be one . Kevin Smith also tells of how the " powers that be " screwed his movie up . Kevin , be a man , and live up to your mistakes . While we're at it take blame for your crappy " Jersey Girl " . It didn't bomb because of some Bennifer thing . It bombed because you're a one-trick pony and you strayed from said one-trick of dick and fart jokes . Deflate your ego a tad bit , bro .

519507	1162550	257106	2.0	Rushed and awful	Lame , unfunny , unnecessary sequel that was rushed into production just to capitalize on the original when it because a surprise sleeper hit . Cindy , Ray , Shoty & Brenda are back this time they all find themselves being tricked into going to a haunted mansion . Where as the first film was actually watchable and pretty funny , this one is neither . And at less then an hour and a half , it's still of battle of willpower to sit through . Tottally rancid on just about every level , waisting the combined talents of the usually reliable David Cross , Chris Elliot , Tim Curry , Andy Richter , and James Woods ( the last is the only slightly amusing aspect of this waste of film ) . Unwatchable .

520495	1162550	1104006	2.0	It's apropos that a film about a demolition turns out to be such a devastating bomb	The O . C . ' s Mischa Barton stars as Sam Walczak , a demolition engineer whom first job is to demolish a building located in the desolate swamps of Scotland . Upon arriving she finds that the building isn't as empty as she was led to believe ( some tenants have inexplicably stayed ) , as well as the fact that the location may very well be haunted by the victims of the people that the architect of said building happened to entombed within it's walls . What started off as a slightly intriguing original story soon and all too readily devolved into a badly acted , scare-free , soap opera-ish . Barton does absolutely nothing to entice the viewer's waning interest and her co-stars ( some of whoms acting is laughably bad ) are not any better . Just when you think it can't get any worse , one of the characters ( who shall remain nameless as to avoid spoilers ) falls down a hole and it does . . . Perhaps with better acting , a more cohesive story , some scares and better directing , this film might have worthwhile to watch , as it stands now , that's sadly quite simply not the case . ( and don't even get me started on the ending )
519685	1162550	439238	2.0	like a late-night Cinemax ' erotic thriller ' WITHOUT the titillation	In this strictly paint-by-numbers direct to video thriller , Detective Max Garret ( Stephen Baldwin ) is assigned to protect Laura Cross ( Kristy ' I STILL refuse to get nude ' Swanson ) . Of course even though he's married to a stunning women , he feels chemistry with Laura and vice versa . It's not really that interesting when red herrings are thrown at the viewer AFTER you know who the killer is . This film was tedious to sit through and extremely uninvolving . All the actors were just going through the paces . When i found out one of the writers was responsible for the dreck known as " Naked Lies " it all clicked into place . No wonder the film was so bad . It's like a Skinamax erotic thriller WITHOUT the sex ( there IS one scene but it's VERY tame ) IE . totally worthless . Eye Candy : Gladys Jimenez gets topless , but her scenes in " Blowback " were better

But not before one of the guys gets a necklace from a voodoo tribe for no reason . The acting is putrid at best and some ok death scenes can't liven up this jumbled mess .

Sadly I do	Detective Campbell ( James Spader ) must track serial killer , David Allen Griffin ( Keanu Reeves ) who has been playing a cat and mouse game with him even going so far as to move to Chicago after Campbell does so . Campbell , a broken mess , thanks to already losing a loved one due to his obsession with Griffin has to make sure that never happens again . If the police in this film were competent in the least they would've caught the perp in the first 10 minutes , thus saving me the next 87 , sadly this is not the case as Griffin parades more or less under their noses right in the open . The ineptitude of these Keystoneesque cops almost had me screaming at the screen in utter disbelief . The acting which is mundanely mediocre did not help matters in the slightest . To top it off the whole mess was at turns extremely trite , contrived & cliché . I'm sorry I watched it .
521008	1162550	487759	2.0	mind-numbingly awful	A Chinese special task force finds some snakes and large eggs in the sewer , which they set fire to . Why they do this I have no earthly idea . But this angers the biggest snake whom they don't know of . After the police leave the big snake slithers out of the sewers and transforms into the very naked " sex Medusa " ( Nomoto Miho , most known for her role in " Fudoh : The New Generation " ) . She's taken in by a sweet and rich , but impotent stranger . There's also a duo of scientists in a side-plot that goes nowhere . This film is not that good in the least and I found myself yawning and looking at my watch quite frequently . You think that the sex Medusa would be really peeved that her ' family ' was killed , but she's more passive then most of the characters in the movie , nothing much happens , and the special effects so to speak are absurd . True Miho is topless a lot in the film ( and bares her ass too ) , but since you can see that in much better film's that she's been in , it's hardly enough reason to see this boringly bad film .

Forsaking the dream logic of the first , Krueger seeks to posses Jesse's body ( not that there's anything wrong with that , as Seinfeld would say ) . This is hands down the worst of the Nightmare on Elm Street movies and not because it's the gayest horror film that wasn't directed by Victor Salva , but in truth that doesn't help in the least . No , this movie sucks ( no pun intended ) because it doesn't seem to care about a little thing called continuity . Freddy exists in dreamland and by blatantly disregarding what the crux of the first film was , this movie defecates all over it ( again not that there's anything wrong with that ) DVD Extras : Cast and Crew Bios ; and Jump to a Nightmare option ( more extras for the film can be found on the seventh disc of The Nightmare Collection DVD set ) DVD-Rom content : Trivia game ; Screenplay ; and web link

Huge plot holes , faulty logic , an un-likable ' heroin ' and the fact that the movie just trudges on make this crime thriller awful . It's one of those direct to video flicks that you'd likely find early in the morning on cable , but even if you do stumble across it don't bother watching . Eye Candy : Alison Eastwood gets topless , Andrea Runge gets full frontal ( yea she's dead at the time , but what ya gonna do , ya know ? )
521340	1162550	191074	3.0	Un-wild wild things meets not so cruel intentions	Unentertaining , uninvolving hybrid of " Cruel Intentions " and " Wild Things " , but it isn't nearly as good as either of those trash min-classics . It's about the acting sheriff , Artie ( Taye Diggs ) being called in to investigate a near-fatal drug overdose at a posh upper-class Univesity , but to keep it on the down low . As he digs deeper he thinks it's much more than it at first glance seems to be . We follow Alicia , the girl who overdosed in flashbacks as well . At about 90 minutes , if this film was welcomed to begin with , it would have worn it out . This film brings absolutely nothing new to the table . But it IS the only movie thus far that has Miss Swain topless so the grade is higher just for that . Eye Candy : Dominique Swain gets topless ( fixing a mistake of " Happy Campers " ) ; another girl is topless Anti-Eye candy : more men ass than girl tit

Mixing unneeded humor with an undesired change of scenery leaves this film wounded before it even reaches the starting gate . Glover is NO Arnold in the least , the acting is horribly overdone , you could tell that a Predator line of toys would soon be on the way , a horrid lame story , crap special effects , all combine to make this one to miss . The only notable scene whatsoever is towards the ending that captured the imagination of fans of the Predator and Aliens franchises . But all for naught because after and impossibly long wait all the audience would get would be the highly Craptacular AVP mockery masquerading as an actual movie , which only served to make this one look good in comparison .

I enjoyed " Alien " , " Total Recall " , " Lifeforce " , his " Heavy Metal " segments , and to a lesser extent " Invaders from Mars " . But he does come off as a tad bit pretentious in this short featurette . Plus he's wearing a damn boy-tie . One of my rules is never EVER trust anyone in a bow-tie .

Bad move . For a film with the words Hell's Angels AND the number 69 AND featuring actual Hell's Angels , this movie is surprisingly tame . The Hell's Angels truly deserve a better film to be centered around them . Not this snoorefest . Luckily this is one of the DVDs that features commentary by Joe Bob Briggs so the pain of having to sit through it is greatly alleviated . If you watch it any other way , let me recommend something to you . DON'T ! !

When that partnership doesn't work out as planned , and with Agent J on a mission that he needs all the help he needs , he goes out to make agent K remember and partner up once again to foil the plans of an alien spore in the guess of a centerfold model . This film was an obvious attempt to cash in on a franchise . And it obviously worked since it made oodles of cash . But as a true movie , it's a lost cause as it's just more of the same of the first movie . Minus the originality , and even the minuscule amount of charm that the first one had . Instead really too much on sight gags and lame humor , sacrificing the story , as flimsy as it might be .

Artie plays a character named Artie who's the pitcher of a pretty bad minor softball team who of course is in conflict with a rival better team . He also falls in love with the town slut . While still better than the atrocious " Beerfest " that came out around the same time , very few of the jokes hit it out of the park and i found myself getting very bored with the film quickly and checking my watch multiple times . Didn't help that one of the female characters voice was annoying enough to make me puncture my eardrums .

520955	1162550	398712	3.0	Precinct 13 ( now with 80 % more ghetto )	It's New Year's eve , a cop-killer ( in the form of , Laurence Fishburne ) end up at a precinct that's closing down due till snow . When the people are layed siege on , cops have to team up with cons to survive . This re-make of the John Carpenter classic just had to add a few beyond stupid plot twists , take out all the tension , and add a horrid John Lequizamo to the cast , didn't it ? The first film was thrilling , gritty , and a joy to watch . This one is more Hollywood , clichéd , and painful to behold . The only thing I took from this movie was OCD can be very annoying . . . VERY . The ending song is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO bad .

520266	1162550	462482	4.0	Highly derivative but not bad enough to hold in contempt	Steve , a census-taker ( Jeremy Sisto , Six Feet Under and Law & Order ) is sent to Rockwell Falls on an assignment , a small isolated town of 436 who harbor a dark secret which they'd rather not let the outside world know about . Unfortunately , Steve has to spend some time there as his tires have a flat . Instantly he's taken by the charms of the lovely Courtney Lovett , he enjoys his stay until he stumbles on the aforementioned ' dark secret ' It's hard to critique this film as it's moderately well acted and the story is moderately involving enough that I didn't instantly regret watching it . It's just that the ' isolated town with a dark secret ' type film has been done many many times before and there's absolutely nothing new that this film adds to the sub-genre ( aside from a horrendous ending that doesn't jar well with anything else in the film in the least , the movie will bring a strong sense of deja-vu for anyone who's seen any of this type of film ) Kudos to Fred Durst for not completely and utterly stinking the film up , but that's all the accolades that I can give the film .
519723	1162550	337921	4.0	the longest Nokia ad I've ever sat through	Ryan , a hopeless loser ( Chris Evans of Not another Teen Movie and Fantastic Four ) , gets a call from a kidnapped wife and mother who is kidnapped and needs his help to get her , her kid and husband out alive in the ' logic be damned ' popcorn action movie . None of the actors come close to acting as good as the true star of the film : Nokia . And the amount of logic that one needs to suspend to get enjoyment out of the film is so staggering that the movie practically demands that the viewer be an intellectual mongoloid even to get SOME semblance of fun out of this travesty . The bad guys are like some fifth-grade " Shield " rejects and some of the acting is laughably bad ( Kim Bassinger channeling the equally awful " the Long Kiss Goodnight " and Adam Gordon as her son can't act in the least , come to mind ) I truly feel bad for the only superb actors in the bunch , as William H . Macy and Jason Statham are pretty much wasted here . ( in all fairness Statham does fare a bit better than the better Macy ) . It's hard to fault Larry Cohen as he's someone I respect a lot , maybe the fault lies more in the execution than anything . But regardless this is a movie to miss .

519958	1162550	87903	4.0	well the first half was enjoyable . . . . .	80's metal band Whitesnake's sultry siren Tawny Kitaen is extremely lucky in some ways ( ie . she dated OJ Simpson and lived to tell the tale ) . but decidedly unlucky in deciding this as her first feature film . Kitaen plays the titular role of Gwendoline who , with some help , is trying to find her father and a rare butterfly . While the first half of this film is so bad , it's good in a campy culty way , humorously enough the second half , when they actually find the girl tribe of the Yik Yak is when it takes a nosedive and becomes tedious . You'd think it would only get better by injecting a truckload of topless women , but you'd be wrong . As it's definitely not . But as I said up to around that point the movie is pretty damn enjoyable . And as bad as the second part of this film got ( and trust me it gets pretty awful ) . I'd STILL watch it a million times more than that " Avacado Women in the Jungle of Death " crap fest . Tawny's next film , Bachelor Party , however , was and still is a bonifide classic no matter how you slice it ( not really because of her , mind you ) DVD Extras : Commentary by Director Just Jaeckin ; Interview with Jaeckin ; Audio interview with comic creator John Willie ; Tawny Kitean photo-spread for Lui Magazine ; and both US & international theatrical trailers
520840	1162550	312358	4.0	As lame as the brother of the main character's legs	Jo Hauser ( Barnaby Metschurat ) , a new intern at a notable German hospital , suspects something's amiss with Proffesor Muller-LaRousse ( Herbert Knaup ) , who is studying the use of bionic muscles in order to make superior humans , but not before getting addicted to the performance enhancing drugs . Well acted , but ultimately uninvolved , unexciting film that is way too generic for it's own good . Franka Potente has a very small cameo to drive up video sales .

520853	1162550	30314	4.0	more cute than humorous	Another musical short that is more cute than humorous is this short about some swinging cats singing in music class . One cat just doesn't get it and is ridiculed unmercifully because of it . Of course he gets it together by the end , but it still made me feel sorry for him when he lacked rhythm . This short wasn't as good as " I Love to Singa " ( which was over praised to begin with ) But it's cute enough to at least watch one time , perhaps even twice ( but not in a row ) and the tunes doesn't seem to make one openly cringe . This animated short can be seen on Disc 4 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2 .
520276	1162550	100827	4.0	If this film was a man who had one evil eye and one lazy googly eye , I'd still laugh at him	Dario Argento and George Romero team up , each telling a tale supposedly based on works of Edgar Poe . Romero's segment further solifies my notion that you can classify whatever George makes into two distinct parts : His Dead trilogy which is great and Everything else which turns out lacking . Blasphemy you say ? Well bullocks to you , if you can prove me wrong please do so . Anyway , in this first segment that plays out like a longer boring version of ' Tales From the Crypt " , Jessica Valdemar ( Adrienne Barbeau , of " Swamp Thing " and " Escape From New York " fame , and NO I will NOT even mention " Maude " it was a horrid horrid show ) wants to off her dying sugar daddy with the help of her hypnotizing Docter lover only to have the old coot come back . Even the almost good last few minutes of it can't save it . Luckily Dario Argento's segment while not without it's flaws ( such as a story thats WAY strecthed out ) , can't help but seem better . In that one Harvey Keitel beats the sh # out of an angry cat and the feline's owner . But it's a bit more then that . ( the high Argento grade cancels out the low Romero grade ) Blue Underground DVD extras : Disc 1 : talent bios ; Theatrical trailer ; and a poster / stills gallery Disk 2 : ' Two Master's Eyes ' documentary ; ' Savini's EFX ' ; " At home with Tom Savini " ; and a five minute interview with Adrienne BarbeauDVD Easter Egg : On disk 2 press up until " Extras " is highlighted to get an interview with George Romero's wife about her bit part as the nurse in his segment
519871	1162550	481369	4.0	could have been good , destroyed by WAY too much spelling it out for stupid people , the ending goes on forever	Jim Carrey decides to go the serious route with the tale of Walter Sparrow ( Carrey ) , whom after finding a book that uncannily mirrors his own life , becomes obsessed with it as well as the number 23 . Virginia Madsen is on hand as his put-upon wife , Agatha . What could have been an intriguing enough movie and solid thriller was sadly hampered with the fact that everything is spelled out slowly and bluntly to the audience whom , one would suspect , the filmmakers seem to believe are slightly mentally retarded and have to be spoon fed from point A to point B like an unthinking lemming . It's extremely insulting to one's intelligence and just sunk the whole film for me . If it weren't for the dumbing down of the film , it would've been good . ( of course it would also be around 45 minutes long ) Eye Candy : Virginia Madsen provides the T &
519536	1162550	71642	4.0	A ( quasi ) good Al Adamson film , who would've thunk it ?	Low-budget schlock director , Al Adamson & frequent collaborator , John D'Amato tell this story of Sandra Tate ( adult movie star Georgina Spelvin of " Devil in Miss Jones " & " the Jade Pussycat " fame ) a prisoner who escapes from custody during a cat-fight between the other female prisoners before she's picked up by Erica , a member of a crime syndicate who whisks her away to the head of said organization who promptly offers her a job which she promptly accepts . When the prostitute whom she hires to help eliminate her first assignment ( a politician with a bad heart ) bugs out and skips town for the border , Sandra & Erica are hot on her trail to tie up this loose end ( no pun intended ) I'm not usually too found of Al Adamson helmed films ( Doctor Dracula & Dracula Vs . Frankenstien are utterly abysmal ) , but compared to his other output , this picture is actually pretty good . Doesn't hurt that I like Georgina Spelvin and think she was an under-rated golden age adult star ( speaking of which she plays a real piece of work here ) The movie drags in parts and has some filler , but the dune buggy / car chase was pretty good and although the movie was far from perfect I didn't feel as if I wasted my time watching it . Eye Candy : Sandy Carey & Tallie Cochrane get topless ; Susan McIver and Georgina Spelvin both show T &
521195	1162550	447927	4.0	and the eye's have it	Frances ( Madeline Zima , currently spellbinding on " Californication " ) is on the way to a camping trip with a few friends when a sudden bout of uncontrollable vomiting ( which might or might not be due to Ectasy ) forces them to stop at a secluded run-down gas station , which in turn sets forth a string of unfortunate events . Soon Frances is distracted by a little girl whom she follows to a house that holds some sinister secrets . Now an unseen monster is after her friends as she tries to help the strange little girl . I was willing to go along with the film up to a point , but the ending pretty much ruined the whole experience for me and was handled better in film's such as " Session 9 " , " the Devil's Chair " and others . Still Madeline Zime is always a joy to watch on screen so it wasn't a total loss . It just wasn't a great choice to waste an hour and a half on either .
521226	1162550	362227	4.0	Terminal is fading fast	This Spielberg helmed tale VERY loosely based on the story of Iranian refugee , Merhan Nasseri , has Tom Hanks as Viktor Navorski , stuck in an American airport , rather than a French one ( because if it was set in France , why couldn't have those great jabs at the Department of Homeland Security , right ? ) after his Visa is void thanks to his home country being in a state of upheaval . He must find a way to survive while the evil Homeland Security authority figure attempts to get him out of the airport . The film actually convinced me that it wasn't going to be a pretty good , albeit cute little film . Then the horribly miscast Mrs . Michael Douglas shows up as Viktor's love interest ( cause , hey what good looking woman WOULDN'T want some homeless refugee man-meat ? ) and the film starts it's gradual decline into mediocrity . Hank's acting is great as alway , but everyone else , not so much . And I'm sorry Tom couldn't or shouldn't have to carry a film all by his lonesome . I'm still waiting for Spielberg to make another great movie ( his last one I loved was " Saving Private Ryan ) , but every film since than , has been a major disappointment in one way or another . This one perhaps more so , as the first 15 or 20 minutes showed much promise .

519820	1162550	222812	5.0	third time lacks the charm	Little Howard Phillips watches his sister get killed by one of Dr . Herbert West's re-animated experiments . Now thirteen years later , Howard now a doctor himself meets Dr . West again in the prison he's being held in . Dr . Phillips is endlessly intrigued by West's ability to re-animate corpses . So now both man continue his experiments once more . But when a investigative journalist , Laura , whom Howard was having an affair with is killed and they take it upon themselves to bring her back using the re-animation formula with an addition of NEE , which is discharged from the brain at the moment of death , the feces really hits the fan . This third film in the series is OK , Jeffrey Combs as Herbert West still delights , but the absence of Bruce Abbot as his collaborator / foil , Dan Cain , is sorely missed . Tommy Musset just can't compare and the film lacks the sheer manic energy of the original or even " Bride " Eye Candy : Elsa Pataky shows very brief left nip ; Raquel Gribler shows better boobage DVD Extras : Commentary by director Brian Yuzna ; a 17 minute and 16 second Making of ; Music Video by Dr .

521418	1162550	330821	5.0	simply average , good bits about Oliver Reed though	This 13 and a half minute Gary Hertz directed featurette is spoiler heavy so I'd advise you watch it AFTER you watch the movie proper . It features Director Sergio Sollima and actor Fabio Testi , they each reflect on the late Oliver Reed , Ennio Morricone , and their respective remembrance of the film in general . This featurette was merely OK , nothing special nor anything bad . Personally , my favorite part was the remembrance of Oliver Reed as I'm fascinated by the late great actor . At 13 and a half minutes the featurette is one of the shorter so I'd recommend at least one viewing of it after you watch " Revolver "
519564	1162550	169590	5.0	fails in comparison to any other batman animated movie	Edited from 3 episodes of " The New Batman Superman Adventures " , this cartoon has Lex Luther accepting the Joker's offer to defeat Superman for him . But Batman follows his arch-nemeses to Metropolis and finds himself teaming up with Superman to take these two villains down . I was a huge fan of " Batman : The Animated Series " , but found Superman's subsequent series to be lackluster at best . So this is a halfway decent film , namely the Batman half ( Well it's not really a half , as Superman hogs up most of the running time ) . Overall the film is the weakest of any of the animated Batman films Doesn't help that the story is mediocre as best . DVD Extras : Cast & Crew Information ; " The Joker's Challenge " game ; Conversation with Producer Bruce Timm ; How To Draw Batman & Superman featurettes ; The Art Of Batman featurette ; Music Montage ; Theatrical Trailer ; and Trailers for " Batman Beyond : Return of the Joker " , " Batman & Mr .

520581	1162550	98184	5.0	Expected more , but it's serviceable enough	Judd Nelson stars as Buck Taylor , a psychopath who picks his victims out of the telephone book . New LA detective Sam Dietz ( Leo Rossi ) and grizzled veteran Sam Malloy ( Robert Loggia ) are tasked with bringing him down in this thriller from Director William Lustig ( Maniac , Vigilante ) and writer Phil Robinson ( All of Me , Field of Dreams ) With the kind of pedigree and talent of those involved , I was expecting more of this film then what I got . I was hoping for a film that stood out from the vast myriad of serial killer films out there . What I got was more of the same and this film was as interchangeable with all the other average films of it's ilk . The only thing notable whatsoever about this movie was the fine performance that Judd Nelson gave , but it was totally unremarkable otherwise . Not really a bad film , merely one you'll feel like you've seen before . Eye Candy : Elizabeth Lambert gets topless DVD Extras : Trailers for " Trapped " , " Panic Room " , & " Secret Window "
519614	1162550	39345	6.0	even an above average Bugs short for McKimson means a below standard one for everyone else	Th Easter Bunny comes down with a bout of the sickness so Bugs Bunny ( no relation ) offers to deliver the eggs to an ungrateful brat of a kid , as well as Elmer Fudd in disguise . As those who know me can attest to , I'm not a big fan of McKimson directed Bugs shorts ( to put it mildly ( And for good reason as most of said shorts were sub-par and not nearly as good as any of the rest of the Bugs cartoons . I would've been happy if McKimson just stayed making Foghorn Leghorn films , but being a Looney Tunes fad , it's just a sad matter of life that you'll going to have to sit through these sooner or later . For a Mckimson short it's good but it's still nothing compared to other non-McKimson directed ones . This animated short can be found on Disk 1 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 3 set .
521091	1162550	95867	6.0	either you're a fan of Sidaris or you're not	The third film in the long " babes with guns " series , has the buxom beauties of a government agency that at this point of the series hadn't been named , go after baddie Miguel Ortiz after he kills secret agent Picasso Trigger . A steady stream of bad acting , massive explosions and even more massive mammeries ( but less nudity than most of the other films in the series ) . When it comes down to it Andy Sidaris's near-trademark mixture of boobs , bullets , and bad acting is not for everyone . You either enjoy the concoction or you don't . I'm more in the former than the latter as I see them as fairly innocent time-wasting eye candy . Just go with it and you'll enjoy to an extant . And while this one might not be his best film ( that would be " Do or Die " in case you're wondering ) , it's still enjoyable if you just remember to turn your brain off at the door . Eye Candy : Cynthia Brimhall , Hope Carlton , Patty Duffek , Kym Malin , and Don Spier all show various amounts of gratuitous skin . DVD Extras : Introduction with Andy and Julie Strain ; Director's Commantary ; 36 minute Behind the scenes featurette ( featuring abundant nudity ) ; Production Stills ; Sndy Sidaris filmography ; web-links ; Theatrical Trailer ; and Trailers for 11 other Sidaris films ( all with abundant nudity ) Easter Egg : There's one hidden in the main menu featuring a nearly fully nude Julie Strain goofing off .
521086	1162550	443676	6.0	more a remake than a sequel , but still entertaining	Former heavyweight champion , George ' The Iceman ' Chambers ( Micheal Jai White , taking over for Ving Rhames ) is sent to a Russian gulag on trumped-up charges where he must fight . Once you get past that this movie is less of a sequel than a remake ( one that misses the whole crux of the original I might add ) . Once you surrender to the fact that Walter Hill is the Undisputed winner in directing . You'll find that this direct to DVD movie is actually pretty good in a brainless action movie kind of way . White does the best with what he's been given and the fight scenes are well staged . One could find worse ways to spend around an hour and a half , can't vouch for the film being very memorable though . To sum up , more in common with the Penitentiary films of days of yore than a sequel to Undisputed , but it's still solid .
520366	1162550	280760	6.0	slightly keeps it's head above water	Kieran Culkin , the talented one in the family , portrays Igby Slocumb . A young adult who can't really adjust to life on the surface because of his experiences growing up with a crazed father and a lush mother . He , while 17 , prefer's the company of older women bedding both his step-father's mistress Rachel ( Amanda Peet ) and an older druggie vegetarian Sookie ( Claire Daines ) while ' on the lam ' from going to military school in this slightly coming of age film . I enjoyed this film surprisingly , and while it did seem slightly pretentious , not nearly as much so as " American Beauty " did . All the performances are pretty damn good and Kieran far outperforms what his brother , Macaulay , appear to be capable of . Not to over praise it , as it does have fault , growing melancholy and predictable towards the end . It also falls in the trap of using music as a cheap ploy to attempt to provoke and / or manipulate emotion . One feels that it's attempting to be Andersonesque , but fails a bit on that level . Take this for what it is , a slightly above-average life drama and be happy with that . Eye Candy : Amanda Peet gets topless
521005	1162550	460898	6.0	Don't let Mary Carey's lack of any acting ability whatsoever deter you from this fun flick	Silly little flick that reminded me of an old King Missile song . It combined the staples of any good horror-comedy , mixing tons of nudity ( arrousal very dependent on your opinion of fuller figured women though ) with a fair amount of blood and off the wall humor that will cause some to laugh out loud and others just groan . I reside in the former for the most part . Sure some of the jokes fall flat and the movie runs a bit too long and can't maintain either the laughs or erotica for it's entire duration , but it's still a pretty good party movie to watch while inebriated or toasty . Lucky I caught it on Starz on Demand as I wouldn't have even heard of if it wasn't . My Grade :
519852	1162550	380687	6.0	better than expected	Dougie , a less then mentally stable 9 year old , is heavily into a video game entitled ' Satan's Little Helper ' , so much so that when he spies a murderer in a devil costume he hardly bats an eye before asking to be his minion and asking if his new ' friend ' can kill his sister's new boyfriend ( Dougie wants to marry his sister himself , but that's neither here nor there ) . Things soon spiral horribly out of control , as they are apt to do in these scenarios . I haven't been too kind to ol ' Jeff Lieberman in the past , I haven't enjoyed his films since " Blue Sunshine " & have on one occasion even drew the ire of the man himself who wrote to me on here . But with that said , I have to give kudos to a film when I feel that it warrants them and I did find this film does just that . Yes it's silly , but it's still likable in it's own demented way ( until it starts to lose steam a tad in the final act ) Joshua Annex steals the movie as the main baddie not even having to say a word , the rest of the cast , including a bizarre acting turn by Amanda Plummer , fare not so well ( but again that's not a real slight against the film , as that's a small part of the charm ) All in all it's a perfectly capable small black comedic horror film .

520401	1162550	357705	6.0	more fun if you've actually been to Mardi Gras	Typical girls gone wild video with girls shaking their T & A and trim at the camera . Made better ( or worse ) by Snoop Dogg's involvement . Frankly I didn't care one way or the other , save for the fact that I saw places that I've been to when I went down to Mardi Gras ( for example I stayed at the hotel that Snoop did , I've been to the Boot , frankly I like The Dunguen better , hell even the dumpy Whirling Dervish was more fun in my alcohol induced stupor ) Note to self : Those Grenades F$ @ K your shiznit up . Anyways back to the DVD . Well I said pretty much everything about the content already . So I guess I liked it only because I've been to Mardi Grace twice ( thus far ) & it brought back fun memories .
520886	1162550	37308	6.0	far from my favorite	Elmer Fudd chases Bugs Bunny into a theater were both of them are forced to act . This isn't my favorite Looney Tunes short by far . It all seems a little off to me somehow and there's no doubt it could have been funnier then it was . More over the ending is a tad on the weak side and I really didn't like Fudd that much in this one , which is a shame as I usually do like him ( well more so than I did here ) . Bugs Bunny isn't really up to par in this short either , for that matter . This animated short can be seen on Disc 4 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2 .
519473	1162550	365137	7.0	thankfully not a horrid spoof	Seduction cinema usually do groaningly awful soft-core spoofs of mainstream movies ( Ie . Spiderbabe , play-mate of the Apes , Lord of the G-string , etc . ) But this lesbian soft-core about a female Dr . Jekyll coming up with a way to unleash the female libido is played mostly straight ( pardon the pun ) Not to say that the story is anything but an excuse for the simulated sex , just that it's not jokey . And thats no surprise as Director , Tony Marsiglia tends to distance himself from spoof as well in the better plotted " Sin Sisters " . The sex scenes in this one are pretty hot as well . And I hope the girl who plays the maid , gets more famous . if for no other reason that then so can fix those teeth of hers .

521123	1162550	1193490	7.0	Good Korean remake	Insurance agent , Jun-oh ( jeong-min Hwang ) goes to a house to talk to an insurance client , where he finds the hanging body of the client's son dead of an apparent suicide . But he soon feels that the young lad didn't kill himself , but was killed to get at a sizable insurance payout . When no one else seems to believe him or even care , Jun decides to get to the truth by himself by digging into the past of the troubled family . Let it be noted that I have yet to see " Kuroi ie " the 1999 Japanese adaptation of the same Yûsuke Kishi novel that this film was also based on , so I can't offer up any comparisons . That being said , I found the South Korean version of the story to be captivating enough to keep my attention throughout and marginally well acted . The film plays it's horror out mostly psychologically until it's last 40 minutes when the film goes all out Slasher and the gore becomes much more visceral . I enjoyed and recommend it . My grade : Region 1 DVD Extras : A 21 minute Making of ; Production design featurette ( 7 minute ) ; and 10 deleted scenes
521113	1162550	264323	7.0	not as good as the original , but enjoyable enough on it's own merits	Three typical college guys , on their way to Florida for spring break , take an unexpected detour into Pleasant Valley , an old southern town headed by the overly hospitable Mayor Buckman ( Robert Englund ) . They find that they're not the only people who took a wrong detour and are joined by more hopeful college partiers , including gasp a Negro ( Mayor Buckman words , not mine ) . Turns out the pleasant lil ' town is anything but . Of course if you're at all familiar with the original H . G . lewis classic " Two Thousand Maniacs " . And people berating the lack of story in this film , definitely have not seen the original . This , like the first one , is just pure deviant gory fun , over the top acting and all . If you only go into this film in that mindset , you'll in all likelihood enjoy the movie . It's not as good as the original , yeah . The redone them song is horrible true . But all in all this flick was fun .

521456	1162550	167019	7.0	Will NOT change the way you have sex , but fun none the less	The legendary , sadly deceased Alex De Renzy directed this film that has Jokn Leslie introducing a series of porn vignettes . The first dealing with a totally ' 80's Lois Ayres all punked out with a superb Mohawk going on ( some people not as prone to loving the 1980's as me may think that's a detriment , whereas I dug it ) . She's topless sunbathing while her family's away . Jamie Gillis and Dan T . Mann are street cop looking for a Perp when they stumble onto Lois , sooner than you can say threesome , they are participating in just that . The scene was very hot . The next scene featuring Gina Carrera and Jacqueline Lorians as roommates who share more then toothbrushes ( if you know what I mean ) , while extremely well filmed , wasn't nearly as good as that first scene . Thankfully the third & fifth scenes MORE than made up for that . Those two ( starring Nina Hartley and Ginger Lynn respectively ) are both smoking and reason enough for any porn aficionado to give this one a go . Sadly scene 4 , being sandwiched in between two amazing scenes comes out lacking . And the last one with a solo Joanna Storm is totally lifeless and stale . All in all I do still recommend the film though .
520413	1162550	602168	7.0	entertaining despite a conclusion you see coming from a mile away	Richard Shepard ( Micheal O'Keefe ) crashes at his friend's place after his wife kicks him out . His friend has to leave for New York , but Rich is not alone as he finds a mysterious dog that does his murderous bidding . He also goes bat-spit insane for no apparent reason . I enjoyed this episode even if the ' suprise ' reveal was a foregone conclusion and could be figured out rather early on . Still the acting is good and it's fun enough to be one of the better episodes of the series . This is one of the episodes that can be found on Volume 1 of the US release of the Hitchhiker . It also has optional commentary by Director Phillip Noyce & Lewis Chesler ( who produced 2 episodes of the series , but neither one of them is this , so I don't really get his inclusion ) Eye Candy : Jennifer Cooke gets topless
520291	1162550	295700	7.0	better then expected	Chris ( Desmond Harrington ) is late for a job interview , the highway is backed up so he decides to see if he can find another route . A dead deer cause him to take his eyes of the backroad & hits another car that has Eliza Dushku & friends it it . Now they're lost in the woods of West Virginia with a deranged family after them . This one surprised me as i wasn't expecting much . But it has good scares & keeps you tense thoughout most of the film .

519771	1162550	43376	7.0	too much naked Sylvester	Sylvester the Cat is left alone in his house all by his lonesome by his neglectful owners who lock him in with nothing to eat or drink . He finds a stash of canned tuna , but a deviant mouse has stolen the can opener and holds it just out of his reach , needlessly tormenting him . This is a somewhat amusing shot , but the mouse is just being a dick for the sake of being a dick which kind of tainted the overall feel of the short a tad . This animated short can be found on disc 4 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 1 and features an optional commentary by Jerry Beck .
519864	1162550	672475	7.0	of to a good start , format may take a bit getting used to	We're introduced to the lives of flatmates office worker , Mark Corrigan and aspiring musician Jeremy Osborne ( David Mitchell and Robert Webb , respectively ) as they both via for the attention of neighbor Toni . Coming into this show knowing nothing except the rave reviews of it , I hadn't a clue what to really expect . I did enjoy this episode very British humour , very dry and cringe worthy ( in a good way ) . The whole inner thoughts set-up will take a bit of getting used to , but I'll definitely give this show another shot and if it keeps the feel of the pilot episode , I'll not be hesitant to recommend it to others in the least bit . My grade :
519930	1162550	70085	7.0	the role Reiko Ike was born to play	Ocho ( Reiko Ike ) , decades after witnessing her father's merciless death , sets out on a quest to find the three responsible for the travesty and exact revenge . In her travels she befriends a handsome your anarchist who's involved with a European spy ( the beautiful Christina Lindberg , perhaps best known for her " Thriller " film ) . This sexy spy along with co-horts wants to dismantle the country from within . All this comes together in a cinematic experience that has to be seen to be believed . Probably very controversial when it was released in Japan of the early ' 70's , the films more ' outragious ' scenes ( the battle in which Ocho is completely nude amongst others ) seem almost quaint now , yet the film retains it's beautiful , almost poetic feel and is definitely one to actively search out . Followed by a sequel that couldn't really reach the same level as this had .
520800	1162550	39747	7.0	not as good as the other two races , but still funny .	The third and finale race between Bugs and Cecil turtle is the least hilarious of the three , but it's still pretty funny at times . This time has Bugs reading Aesop's fables while relaxing . when he gets to the end of the story he's flabbergasted that the fairy tale had the Hare losing the race . So he challenges Cecil ( whom he doesn't seem to remember from the other two times ) to a race . As I said before the other two cartoons are funnier and more well paced than this one . The gag of the enhanced rocket shell also seems to be a tad long in the tooth , but I still had fun with the short . This animated short can be seen on Disc 1 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2 .
521403	1162550	395656	7.0	not really as comprehensive as I would have liked	This documentary can be found on the fourth disk on the Complete Adventures of Indiana Jones box set and is split into three segments , each having to do with each of the three movies , the most interesting segment is the first part as it's the most informative , not to say that the other two segments are not , but the second segment features way too much apologizing for " Temple of Doom " , listen that movie is great and there's no reason to apologize for it in the least , the third segment on " the Last Crusade " is pretty interesting and all , but they leave out some stuff that I would have loved to hear more about in all three segments such as the Barbera Streisand incident , and some others . But what we do get is still pretty cool I enjoyed seeing some Indy auditions and the interviews were OK , and it was nice to see how stuff came together , but it just could've been more .
519728	1162550	361862	7.0	watch it , if only for Bale's performance	Christian Bale stars as Trevor Reznik . an insomniac whom hasn't slept for a year . His sanity begins to deteriorate and his paranoia begins to rise after a work related injury befalls one of his co-workers . I rented this one when my lady friend wanted to get one and she told me this or " Diary of a Mad Black Woman " ( which I couldn't help but laugh at the suggestion , which got her slightly mad , but I digress ) . Needless to say , I picked this one . I really got into it , not for the ' mystery ' , as any seasoned viewer worth his salt will figure out everything rather quickly ( the first time I saw the Hangman game it was plainly obvious ) , but rather Christian Bale's performance which is mesmerizing . He's on a fast-track to becoming one of my favorite actors of my generation . The fact that he put himself through all this just for one independent film is amazing . Furthermore , this movie almost makes me forgive Scott Kosar for all his silly little wrong-minded remakes . . . . ALMOST . DVD Extras : Commentary by Brad Anderson ; 25 minute Making of featurette ; 8 Deleted / Alternate scenes ( 2 with optional commentary ) ; Theatrical Trailer ; and Trailers for " Mean Creek " , " Enduring Love " , " Suspect Zero " , & " Schultze gets the Blues " Eye Candy : Jennifer Jason Leigh gets topless
520343	1162550	323633	7.0	Conversation : the movie , you'll feel like you're actually conversing	Melvin ( Writer Micheal Blieden , adapting his own stage play for the small screen ) , meets up with friends , old and new , over dinner and has a conversation about ghosts , religion , sex , secrets , and religion ( not necessarily in that order ) . The conversation itself is engaging and flows nicely , but the scenes out of the restaurant , though not without merit ( David Cross , Jack Black , and Maura Tierney , have good parts in said parts ) , tend to mess up the flow of the film somewhat . And based on the film I'd be interested in seeing the play . DVD Extras : Commentary by Bob Odenkirk , Micheal Blieden , and cast members ; Second Commentary by Odenkirk , Blieden , the producers , composer , and Cinematographer ; " The Frank International Film Festical " ( a funny 15 minute skit ) ; Scenes from the stage play Phyro-Giants !

520178	1162550	1062161	7.0	a really fun ' Sci-fi Original ' ( will wonders never cease ? )	The Thorax team is tasked with exterminating ants that somehow managed to take over an island , but these are no ordinary any , oh no , there's are super-ants with a master plan . Yes , this movie is utterly ridiculous , but it's also extremely watchable and has a very high camp factor . The Sci-fi channel doesn't have the best of track records when it comes to their ' Sci-fi Originals ' , but thankfully this one stands head and shoulders among the best of those . Turn off your brain , just go with it , and enjoy the film with your choice of alcoholic beverage . The only grip I have is that the ending was a bit of a let-down .
521459	1162550	178574	7.0	interesting if not arousing	A collection of early shorts ( a combination of old stag films , vintage shorts , cartoons , and films made for the Penny Arcades ) is narrated ( seldomly ) by an unknown voice over guy in this documentary / Compilation piece by Alex De Renzy , who himself would go on to become a highly regard porn director ( his best stuff being made in the late 70's and much of the ' 80's . The film is interesting if only to see how much porn advanced in some ways , but didn't at all in others . There's nothing to really get aroused to in here , but if you ever were interested in how it all got started , then this will have you fascinated to no end . ( well except for some of the filler )
521268	1162550	114508	7.0	Introducing Natasha	As a young girl , Sil ( Michelle Williams , who of course would get nude herself in the horror chick flicks , " If These Walls Could Talk 2 " and " Me Without you " ) , a human / alien hybrid , escapes her government captivity . In a matter of days , she turns into Natasha Henstridge who yearns to mate . Micheal Madsen is among the crew assembled to find and kill her . Both Forest Whitaker and Ben " Gandhi " Kingsley are pretty much wasted , but Madsen does alright and Natasha getting nude copious amount of times make this a fun , if brain dead little sci-fi flick . Nothing ground-breaking here , just enjoyable b-movie popcorn fare . DVD Extras : Commentary by Director Roger Donaldson , Micheal Madsen , and Natasha Henstridge ; Second commentary by Donaldson , Frank Mancuso Jr , Richard Edlund , and Steve Johnson ; Sneak peek at Species 3 ; Theatrical Trailer ; red-band trailer for " the Howling " ; trailer for " Jeepers Creepers 2 " ; one for " Earthsea " ( a scifi channel mini-series ) ; and a few montage trailers Eye Candy : Marg Helgenberger gets topless ; Natasha Henstridge shows it all .
519711	1162550	124406	7.0	Interesting hybrid porn	Nate ( Richard O'Neal ) goes off on a cattle drive , not before having sex with his wife , Sarah ( Barbara Bourbon ) , of course . After 3 escaped convicts rape her , steal her three nubile daughters and then flee , leaving her strung up by her hands , she of course wants revenge . So when a rag-tag posse chasing the convicts rescue her , she insists on traveling with them . This is a curious film , as a porno / western hybrid , it's the first of it's kind that I've seen . Some may be put off by the highly exploitative showing of rape and incest . But I found myself actually drawn into and interested in what would happen next . The film is a further example of how porn films now shot on video , just don't seem to cut it ( barring , of course , the way above average output of Directors Micheal Zen , Brad Armstrong , and few others ) My Porn
521287	1162550	355458	8.0	simple , to the point , i like it	Having some free time on my hands I decided to watch some short films on Atomfilms . " Frei Parken " ( or Free Parking ) runs around 7 minutes and tells the simple story of a woman trying to get a parking space , but there are a few obstacles in her path . This feeling is universal and of course it's dramatized for entertainment porpoises but overall it's just a fun little short film . This is what short films should be about . No complex plots , no experimental filming techniques to satisfy you and your art house friends . Just quick in , quick out and leave them waiting more . Kudos to Bernhard Jasper and to a lesser extant Christopher Roth
520205	1162550	427699	8.0	Intriqing	This 39 minute and 40 second documentary can be found on the disc 2 of the Two-Disc Special Edition DVD of Purple Rain , it features interviews with pretty much everyone involved in the movie except Prince himself ( Although not surprisingly , as he hates Warner Brothers ) . Anyway the topics of what the non-actors went through to get the film on the screen , the cultural impact of the movie , the casting , and just the basic genesis of the great film . The featurette was extremely intriguing and highly watchable for any true fan of what is one of the best musical movies ever . ( Not an out right just because of Prince not being involved )
519869	1162550	454987	8.0	crying takes the sad out of you	John Lyshitski ( Dax Shepard ) is a young guy who's spent most of his life in prison , blaming the judge who continuously sent him them , he hatches his plan for revenge . But he dies three days before he gets free of prison , so John decides to go after the judge's son , Nelson ( Will Arnet of brilliant " Arrested Development " fame ) John's plan is to frame Nelson , get him sent to jail , and then get himself sent to the same jail to bunk with him , which he accomplishes . But things don't always go as planned afterwords though . Personally I found this film hilarious and don't really know why there's all this hatred towards it . Will Arnet is pretty funny and Dax Shepard plays off him quite well . But the REAL star of the film is Chi McBride as Barry , an eloquent rapist . Whenever he's on the screen it had me in stitches . The film's not as good as Mr . Show was ( but hell what can be ? ) But director Bob Odenkirk still has a winner here .
520828	1162550	285005	8.0	Best of the trilogy	Two hit men ( Riki Takeuchi and Sho Aikawa ) cross paths while pulling off a job . They decide to run a playground and reminisce about their shared childhood . Quite a bit lighter in tone than the original " Dead or Alive " which the sequel has ( apart from the same two lead actors ) nothing in common with . When I say ' lighter in tone ' , I of course mean for a Takashi Miike film . This movie is more about the wonders and joys of children growing up , not yet jaded by how the world really is . Fans of Miike's bizarreness won't be disappointed with it either . I myself like this film more then the first one and is superbly acted . DVD Extras : Theatrical Trailer ; and Trailers for " Dead or Alive " " Dead or Alive Final " , " Sharkskin and Peach Hip Girl " and " Junk Food "
520429	1162550	120844	8.0	better than the Luke-warm response it got when first released suggests	Picard and his crew of the next generation Enterprise must rebel against an alien race , So'na , lead by Ad'har Ru'afo ( the superb F . Murray Abraham ) , and Starfleet itself , when they find out about the proposed plan to abduct the Ba'ku , a peaceful race who have forsaken technology in order to get back closer to nature , in order to get a hold of the regenerating properties of the land . It's up to the crew of the Enterprise-E to withhold the Prime Directive which states no Starfleet expedition may interfere with the natural development of other civilizations . All non-Trekkie's aren't likely to appreciate all the allusions to past Ster Trek events , as revealed on ST : TNG , nor the particularities of both the quarks and nobilities of the characters , so if you're one of those aforementioned people feel free to take a few stars of my rating . But for those well versed in the rich mythology of the universe of TNG , this film is likely to pay back said knowledge in spades with enjoyment . It's the closest thing to 2 new episodes that we're likely going to get as the film duplicate the feel and tone of the show quite admirably . Not to say that all out action has no place in the Star Trek lore , as I enjoyed " First Contact " as well , just for vastly different reasons . This is definitely a movie that has aged well and gotten long deserved respect as opposed to the short shift it got while it was in theaters . 2 disc Special Edition DVD Extras : Disc 1 ) Text Commentary by Michael and Denise Okuda Disc 2 ) 7 Production Featurettes ; 2 Star Trek Universe Featurettes ; 3 Creating the Illusion Featurettes ; 7 Deleted Scenes with introduction by co-producer Peter Lauritson ; Storyboards ; photo gallery ; Ad for the Las Vegas Borg Invasion show ; Original promo piece ; and Teaser & Theatrical trailer 3 Easter Eggs : all 3 eggs are on disc 2 .

Tom the cat , Jerry the mouse , and Spike the Dog ( here called Butch , his third name , his second being ' Killer ' ) decide to sign a peace treaty to all love each other . It's weird and a bit unnatural seeing them all buddy buddy like this and their friend's seem to think so too . But by the end thanks to a disagreement over a steak , everything is back to normal and all is how it should be . This short is the second one of three on the new Spotlight DVD to be edited and I have no clue why this one was .

Separated into 3 parts , the first part goes into the origin of the story in the film ( which is simply fascinating ) , the second part , running 20 minutes , goes mostly into the characters of the film and the intricacies ( this part into nearly as interesting as the first , but still watchable ) . The third and final part , running 24 minutes goes into the researching , preparation , and gun training for the film ( better than the second segment , yet still not as good as the first ) . all in all a pretty solid documentary .
521079	1162550	1000258	8.0	Life on Mars	The trio of the Doctor , Martha , and Captain Jack return to Earth , present day . The Master ( superbly played by " Life on Mars's John Simm ) under the guise of Harold Saxon has just been elected England's new Prime Minister and if the trio think that the dire situation can't get much worse , the Master and his metallic ball Toclafane will prove them how wrong they can be . After the brilliant opening gambit that was " Utopia " , this episode couldn't help , but feel like a step down , however a slight one . It still remained captivating and i still wait with baited breath as to how it will all end . It's just that it felt , to me at least , that their was a tad more levity in this episode somehow . Not that it's all grins ( it isn't ) , just that the mood didn't seem to fit in some way i can't really explain . But I digress , the fact remains that it's still a fairly tight episode .
521356	1162550	416633	9.0	gut-splitting	Leatherface is all set to kill a couple in the woods , but things don't go as planned in this hilarious short . Kevin Van Hentenryck of " Basket Case " and " Brain Damage " fame gives a great performance as Leatherface . Hopefully it won't be twelve more years before he graces the screen with his presence again . J . R . Havlan and Matt Unger know about the funny very much . Give these guys a bigger budget . Plus I wouldn't mind seeing much more of Genevieve Hannon in the future , if you know what I mean , and I think you do . heh heh heh . So go see this film if you get a chance . If you're a horror fan you'll love it . My Short
520525	1162550	466364	9.0	pretty god doc	This documentary on the making of " The Janitor " can be found on the DVD of the fore-mentioned movie . It runs around an hour and deals with the trials and tribulations of making a low budget horror-comedy . Featuring audition footage , interviews with the cast and crew , dealing with Lloyd Kaufman , shooting the gang bang scene ( no Asians , no Indians , no Persians ) , the special effects , post-production , and showing the completed film . I found this documentary to be at turns informative , humorous , and overall highly watchable with none of the fake BS that you find in documentaries of bigger budgeted movies and all the better for it .
520210	1162550	83131	9.0	A classic comedy for GUYS	John and Russell ( Bill Murray and Harold Ramis , respectively ) join the Army after John , dissatisfied which how his life is going , talks Russell into it . They have to survive boot camp , as well as , along with their love interests and Sgt . Hulka ( Warren Oates ) , save the rest of their Platoon when they're trapped behind enemy lines . This is the best comedy revolving around the Army ever and has so very many memorable scenes and quotable lines that it's unreal . All the actors are great in the parts ( including a superb Warren Oates , hilarious Bill Murray , Harold Ramis , John Candy & John Larroquette ) The Extended edition , unlike SOME so-called ' special editions ' actually adds substance to an already classic film . It's almost impossible for any red-blooded American male NOT to love this film . DVD Extras : Both the 106 minute Theatrical cut & 122 minute Extended edition ; Commentary by director Ivan Reitman and co-writer / producer Dan Goldberg : " Stars and Stripes " 2-part documentary ; 6 deleted scenes Theatrical Trailer ; a complication trailer for ' 80's hits ' ; and Trailers for " D .

It's a toss up on what he detests more . This was the film that spawned one of the best trilogies EVER . Most fall apart by the third movie ( : Godfather , Back to the Future , Star Wars ALL have weak links ) , not so here , ALL the Indiana Jones films are pure gold . And bring back very fond childhood memories . THIS is a action-packed blockbuster like it should be done . Thrilling , exciting , humorous , and insanely great escapism . Accept no substitutes , because Indiana Jones is one of a kind . DVD-Rom content : an exclusive web link to get picture galleries , a PC game demo , and Raiders Animatic : Opening the Ark

But the bad guys are after the figurine as well after realizing the one they have is a counterfeit . Written and directed by porn revolutionary , Bob Chinn , this film takes you back to a day when you had a compelling story with your hot sex . Word of warning tho , there IS a rape scene , so beware of that . Also be aware that it ends on somewhat of a cliffhanger , so it's advised that you watch " the China Cat " soon after you finish this film .
519925	1162550	490773	9.0	When trailers rocked your socks off	If you love what now would be called ' red-band ' trailers ( the greats ones that don't skimp on the good stuff , be it any of the three B's : blood , boobs , and / or bush ) , this compilation of trailers for low-budget ' grindhouse ' movies is definitely for you . True , a small handful of the trailers are useless ( thankfully relegated closely to the end , such as ' Superfuzz ' , and one or two others ) , but for the most part this collection is superb . Not one , not two , but three Christina Lindberg trailers with her in her FULL glory , if you catch my drift . ( God she's stunning ) , The Hammer when he was still at the top of his game as ' Boss Ngger ' , campy gay bike riders , and a ton of nudity , gore and violence are just a few of the delightfully high points . Of course this is not really for everyone , but anyone who wants a trip down memory lane or just wants to see how good trailers used to be , rent this ASAP . You will NOT be disappointed .

There are no " good guys " to be found . There are only manipulators , users , and poor brainless chumps . This is David Cronenberg at his best . The film is hopelessly nihilistic , devastatingly bleak , and endlessly intriguing and watchable . This is the type of cinema that endless tomes can be wrote about , dissecting every aspect of it hoping to find the meaning while pouring over it's symbolism and praising it's greatness . This is the type of film that one can watch over again and pick up on new things with each subsequent viewing . This is James Woods in the top echelon of his game .

521131	1162550	55824	9.0	a classic of thrilling noir	In quite possibly his best and most memorable role , Robert Mitchum is Max Cady , a smooth-talking , malicious pedophile recently released from prison after an 8 year stint in the pen . He targets Sam Bowden ( Gregory Peck ) , a man who helped put him in jail , his wife Peggy , aid in particular , his daughter , Nancy . This original version is MUCH more thrilling , suspenseful and such a sheer joy to watch when compared to Martin Scorsese's misfire of a remake with lacked the original's spirit , substituting a glossy veneer and gore for this film's high tension and amazing performances . Director J . Lee Thomson coming off of the brilliant " Guns of Naverone " , made another classic , albeit of a much smaller , budgetary if not emotionally , scale with this film .

520624	1162550	370244	9.0	Outstanding	The third film I got to watch at the philly film fest was this outstanding drama from Japan . After breaking out of prison nine escaped convicts plan to find the " key to the universe " that a tenth convict who didn't break out told them about . Along the way we get to know each of these men fairly well . Each has their own dreams . For much of the movie it seems to be mostly a comedy , but a shift takes place that the film ends up a tragedy . All of the actors give great performances . I can't say much more without spoiling the film , but suffice it to say that you end up feeling for some of these individuals . At 2 hours , this film is a tad to long , but good none the less . I have no qualms recommending it with the warning that it does have a bit unsettling violence for the tender-hearted . Toshiaki Toyoda hit a home-run this time out , and it makes me want to search out his prior films as well as look forward eagerly to his future ones .
520089	1162550	304296	9.0	In my top 5 of Takashi Miike's films	A prequel to Miike's " Young Thugs : Innocent Blood " , this follows Riichi in his early formative years growing up on his way to becoming the thug in the earlier film . One of the very few problems I had with Innocent Blood is the lack of in depth characterization , but that's remedied here in spades . Filled to the brim with the joys , heartbreaks , and wonder of childhood . the movie is universal in it's appeal and a true joy to behold . One of my favorite foreign coming-of-age films . This only solidifies the nothing that Miike can do much more then the violent , bizarre films that he's primarily known for .

520861	1162550	39251	10.0	pure magic	Tom is playing Hungarian Rhapsody # 2 for an audience , but when he wakes up Jerry , he must maintain his perfect piano playing abilities while contending with the mouse . I know there was a controversy between this short and the WB's Looney Tune short " Rhapsody Rabbit " ( which is a funny short as well and the similarities are a lot ) , but I feel that this Tom and Jerry short is the clear winner . It is damn near pitch perfect and one of the best Tom and jerry cartoon shorts of all time . And rightfully so . The classic tune meets classic animation . This award winning cartoon can be found on disc one of the Spotlight collection DVD of " Tom & Jerry "
519839	1162550	121955	10.0	Better than the Simpsons overall after taking into account how bad that once great show has gotten	Stan . Kyle , Cartman , Kenny , are the funniest thing to ever come out of Comedy Central thus far , and I have a feeling that will remain true in the future as well . " South Park " is hilarious , thought-provoking sure , but mostly hilarious in it's profanity and outrages situations . From time to time it seems to ruffle the feathers of the ultra-thin skinned PC crowd due to the Libetarian philosophy that pervades in most of the episodes , but they're huge p % & sies anyway . Sure this had a few lame episodes , but never in a row of four and never enough to make a whole season not worth watching ( yet the 8th season WAS trying at times ) . But overall it's a great show , and if Matt Stone & Trey Parker are able to keep the pace up for another year of great episodes then it'll have a better run than the Simpsons , in my mind , that had stopped being good at around Season 9 or 10 ( I don't really see the first 2 seasons of that show being that great either , so that's 7 seasons of Simpson's genius hilarity against about 8 of South Park that were great )
520623	1162550	330793	10.0	We can rebuild it , make it stronger	Being an avid reader of " Punisher " , I was waiting to see this film for quite some time . Opting to see it over going to the second half of " Kill Bill " ( which I'll wait for video as I don't like being out 15 bucks to see ONE film , but that's a story for a different day ) . Thomas Jane does do a pretty good job at playing Frank Castle ( an ex-FBI agent who is out for revenge when everyone of his relatives die ) , . MUCH better then Dolph . And Travolta wasn't THAT hammy , but having such high expectations , I couldn't help but be let down a bit . Now , I'm not one of those nuts who whine when any little thing is changed from the comic book character & Frank's background being different didn't bother me . I was off-put by Castle's wisecracks , some of them cringe worthy . The sequel still holds big possibility , and I'd still implore you to see this one , so another one can be made . Just don't expect anything more than a slightly above average action flick & you'll be fine . I DID love the fight with the Russian though and it's easily the highlight of the film . My Action Movie
520795	1162550	44404	10.0	Fantastic	This second pairing of Wile E . Coyote and the Road Runner is a great as the first . Predictable maybe , but I don't care and still laugh so much whenever I see it . The Wile E . / Road runner shorts always had the most special place in my heart . So knowing that the second disc of the Golden Collection would not only feature 11 of this , BUT they would be in chronological order ( 2 through 12 , the first episode was on Volume 1 ) , made me get misty eyed . I LOVE this stuff . This animated short can be seen on Disc 2 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2 . It also features an optional commentary by Micheal Barrier .
521389	1162550	200427	10.0	A diamond in the rough	Great film about Eddie ( a superb Robert Forster ) having to train young upstart , Eddie ( Donnie Wahlberg ) in the diamond selling biz . Their chemistry is superb . The dialog just crackles & it pulls you right into this film . Of course one knows where the film's headed way in advance , but that doesn't distract from the brilliant acting in this character study . I highly recommend it & i rarely hand out suck accolades easily . Where I saw It : ShowtimeEye Candy : Both Kristen Minter as Cherry and Sannah Laumeister as Amber drop their tops ( and at what may be a first Nikki Fritz as Fran leaves hers covered , heh go figure )
519557	1162550	45697	10.0	N9t the best one in the series of Ralph / Sam but still hilarious	Sam Sheepdog , I mean Ralph , is determined not to let Wile E . Coyote . . ahem I mean Ralph Wolf get off with the sheep that he's watching . Despite the name snafu off the first Sam Sheepdog and ralph cartoon , it's still hilarious and a great short that can be watched multiple times yet still return the same amount of chuckles that it had the first time you ever saw it . The funny thing even with how funny this short is this isn't even the best of the seven Sam / Ralph cartoons . Truly a great concept . But then again I might be a tad biased as I love Wile E . Coyote . This hilarious cartoon is on Disk 3 of the " Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 1 "
520061	1162550	1000259	10.0	wow	At the known end of the universe , far FAR in the future where no Time Lord has traveled before , Martha and the Doctor meet up with Captain Jack Harkness whom hitched a ride on the outside of the TARDIS . It's not long before they're on the run from cannibalistic , Futurer-kind , and trying to help an enigmatic professor shuttle the last vestige of the Human race off to Utopia . What a great opener to the three-part 29th series finale , it has long-running simmering plot-lines coming to a head in the most delightful of ways . The cliff-hanger which , sadly , in the internet age , one had to have his head firmly in the ground to not have been spoiled to , was great none the less and had me breathlessly awaiting the next two installments .
519906	1162550	89619	10.0	great pilot for a great series	Ex-model Maddie Hayes , now penniless thanks to an shifty accountant , decides to liquidate the businesses that she still owns . But David Addison wants desperately to keep his job as a private eye at a detective agency that Maddie owns . After a dying man forces Maddi to take a watch , they find themselves chased by bad people . As well as the start of a TV love / hate relationship for the ages . The chemistry between Bruce Willis and Cybil Sheppard is amazing , the dialog is great and this is one of the better TV movie pilots that I've seen . The pilot can be seen on the Complete First & Second seasons DVD Set ( and I can't recommend that you buy it highly enough )
