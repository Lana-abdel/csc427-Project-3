520977	1162550	213673	1.0	Move along there's nothing to see here	A group of human looking aliens going to Earth to eat crash land on a planet of prehistoric beasts instead where they all eat physcedelic mushrooms and act retarded . Padded with footage from " Planet of the Dinosuars " and horrible jokes this is definitely one to miss . The acting is atrocious as well , and while this isn't as bad as " Chickboxer " ( what movie can be ? ) This is still pretty awful repugnant stuff . It's 90 minute running time feels like an eternity and you will likely be cursing life so do yourself a huge favor and just move on , skip this crappy film , there's nothing to see here .

520150	1162550	435729	1.0	poor , poor Hauser	After the offspring of an inbred redneck union of brother and sister is ditched in the fields of nowhere , a fellow God fearing redneck finds her and she grow up as a pet would . Twenty years later , a group of young adults on vacation in the mountains find that trouble is a brewing from the town folk hicks who are addicted to psychedelic eggs ( which one of the gang partakes in ) after an altercation in a strip-club . The film also boasts a cameo by the great Wings Hauser as Wings Hauser ( DON'T call him Hasselhoff ) , don't get your hopes up as he's in it all of three minutes ( if that ) Wow , this movie was extremely bad ( even for a Troma film ) not one character acted one iota resembling anything a normal person would act like . Without relating to any of them in any way , shape , or form , it made the hour and a half go by extremely slowly and i found myself looking at my watch on numerous occasions . I'm one of those people who HAVE to watch a movie till it's finish once I start it . On occasions such as this , that trait is quite the curse indeed . As for Mr . Hauser , well we all need money from time to time , so I won't hold it against him . . . . . just this once . Eye Candy : Natalie Hays & Rachel Wagner both provide the T & A ; an extra gets topless

NO ON	A 4 minute campy tour of San Francisco gives way to the inner thoughts of the girls who appear in the Russ Meyer films and other strippers ( as if we give a hoot about what they have to say , just shut up dance and look pretty . You're strippers dammit , not brainy philosophers ) , footage of Meyer's own " Europe in the Raw " , as well as screen test footage of of Lorna Maitland in Russ Meyer's " Lorna " Probably my forth least favorite Russ Meyer's film , ahead of " Pandora Peaks " and his two Studio films ( " Beyond the Valley of the Dolls " and " The Seven Minutes ) No plot , dancings OK , but WAY too much yakkity yak .
520993	1162550	373343	1.0	Warning : Will cause severe drowsiness	Super Badass leaves farm life for the big city in 1957's Mississippi to become a hard-drinking , drug-taking , pigeon-filming bounty hunter . His father warns that Death will be riding behind him . Needless to say , a masked guy with a Death license plate does indeed ride behind him . He goes after the likes of The Boogyman , Bucko the Clown , Light Bulb , and various other riff-raff . I feel that nearly any subject matter can be filmed well , if the Director of said subject matter is talented , or at the very least competent . But in this instance the Director Charles Cullen seems to possess neither of those traits . And as suck , those who have the misfortune to suffer through this are in for the longest 70 minutes of your life .

If you've seen the first " Hollywood Dreams " , you can skip this one as it's more of the same . And if you haven't seen the first one then I ENVY you . Count your blessings . It's hours of my life , I can not get back . The acting doesn't even reach ' Porn caliber ' . Most of the girls don't either for that matter . Remember I watch this crap , so YOU don't have to ! !

Does it work ? nope , it's still crap that I'd have to scrape off my boots if I stepped in it . Will anyone like this mess ? Sure , Young teen aged mongoloids with the combined IQs of a Vienna sausage have to laugh at something , I guess . For those who have brains that are even semi-functioning steer clear though and watch something less insulting to your intelligence , even " Dude , Where's my car " would do .
521337	1162550	360916	1.0	the fake people	MTV is the epitome of narcissistic superficial artificial slack-jawed mentality that has changed the direction in the youth of American culture for the worse . And the film is quite possibly the nadir of said stupidity . In it a group of young blank twenty-somethings slither their war through spring break in Cancun sharing a beach house ( a la " Real World ) . How these rocket scientists can share a house when they don't even share a braincell among them is a mystery for the ages . One of them is a sober geek who never drank so much of the " reality " movie is based on getting him wasted . All of this is accompanied by mostly flavor of the week crappy music that again is like MTV . Horrible .
521016	1162550	87385	1.0	ALMOST the bottom of the barrel ( the sequel is the bottom )	Scotty ( Grant Cramer , who would go on to star in the great B-movie " Killer Klowns from outer space " ) agrees to help three middle-aged guys learn how to ' dialog ' the ladies in this bad ' 80's comedy . Not bad as in ' 80's lingo , which meant good . Bad as in bad . With no likable characters , including , but not limited to , a kid who's the freakiest looking guy since " Friday the 13th part 2 " ' a girl who leads men on and then goes into hissy fits when they want to touch her , and the token fat slob , because after all what would an ' 80's sex comedy be without a fat slob ? ? Well this one has two . This movie is pretty much the bottom of the barrel of ' 80's sex comedies . And then came the sequel thus deepening said proverbial barrel . My Grade : Eye Candy : too numerous to count , you even see the freaky looking kid imagined with boobs at on point , think " Bachlor Party " but not as funny , and VERY disturbing .

521421	1162550	490469	1.0	a trite , clichéd mess	After Billy ( Costas Mandylor of the Saw films ) is sent to prison for killing Sean Walker's ( Blue Lagoon's Christopher Atkins ) partner ( among other things ) , Sean quits the police fore and moves his family to an isolated ranch where he takes work as a farmhand with his dad . Ten years later , Billy is back on the streets after escaping and looking to settle the score with Sean by hitting him where he hurts most , his family , including his wife the left him ( Angie Everhart ) and their homely sex-crazed , bi-curious daughter . ( don't get too excited as that aspect of the story goes nowhere ) This film is a heavily-clichéd , extremely badly acted , horribly written ' action revenge ' picture . This not only pales greatly in comparison to Mel Gibson's similarly name " Payback " , but also is the worst film with the name that I've seen yet ( to this date i've seen 5 of those named films as well as a TV film , all much better then this one ) Don't bother renting this one unless you have a stalkerish fascination with Angie Everhart Eye candy : An extra gets topless ; Nicole LeVoy shows T & A ( there's also nudity in the trailers for " Natasha " & " Distortion " ) DVD Extras : Trailers for " Kush " , " Good girl , Bad girl " , " Natasha " , " Army of the Dead " , " This thing of ours " , & " Distortion "

Then Sara falls for the murdered guy's twin brother's charms . One of the worse soft-core porns that I've watched . And if you read any of my other reviews , you know that I'm not one prone to hyperbole . The sex scenes arn't erotic in the least , no moaning , and to top it off they're all cut short .

521143	1162550	416934	1.0	awful	A pretty fluffy 12 minute piece that can be found on the DVD of said movie . The only good part is when they admit in a roundabout way that the Coen brothers were hesitant about directing a piece of excrement like this . It also contains mini-interviews of how great the film is how great the other actors were , how amazing everything about everything is . It's just a promotional piece that I hate . Nothing noteworthy , neither interesting in the least . even though it only laster 12 minutes , that's STILL 12 minutes of my life I will never have back ever . And I weep for that fact .
520565	1162550	116769	1.0	Speechless	The Killer Barbies van breaks down so they have to stay at a castle owned by a woman who bathes in blood and semen . Less of an actual movie than an overlong music video . This is quite the chore to get through . Horrid acting , boring clichéd lackluster plot , lame special effects , and a general putrid stench all add up to a horrible experience . . . even for a Jess Franco film ( Franco fans , are of a different breed and have a much MUCH higher tolerance for cinematic crap ) Followed by a ( why god ? WHY ? ? ? ! ! ? ? ) sequel . DVD Extras : Intro & Scene specific commentary by the band ; Talent Bios ; Band interview ; Movie review ; 2 Music videos by ' the Killer Barbies ' ; Lobby card gallery ; Jump to a scream option ; and Trailers for " Jungle Holocaust " , " Eaten Alive " , " Beyond the Darkness " , & " Burial Ground " Easter Egg : Intro outtakes & CD promo
521120	1162550	431074	1.0	how to NOT make a comedy	What makes this movie so damn bad ? Is it the lame sub-par juvenile humor ? Could it be the horrid " trendy " suck ass music ? Perhaps the uninspired go nowhere story ? Or maybe even the fact that Traci Lords gives her worst acting performance ever and to add insult to injury keeps all her clothes on throughout the length of this steaming turd sandwich . Regardless no matter what the reason this film sucks , the fact remains that it really REALLY does . I have never wished I could be watching a movie with Dean Cameron in it instead of what I was watching in my life , but " Ski School " is a masterpiece of comic genius compared to this travesty . Eye Candy : Nikol Nesbitt , Buffy Tyler and Suzanne Stokes all unleash their Tupperware titsWhere I saw it : Starz on Demand
520752	1162550	350370	1.0	pathetic attempt at a horror / comedy	Bunny and Steve plan a weekend camping trip with Trevor and Tammy whom they hope to hook up so Tammy will forget her former boyfriend . But once at the camping site , radioactive meteorites crash into a nearby cemetery causing the dead to rise up from their graves . Which none of the major characters realize for about half the film . The zombies don't even come into play into half an hour goes by and due to the feeble attempts at humor ( the near-nudity gag akin to an Austin Powers film is not witty nor clever in the slightest , the ' plot encapsulating ' park ranger is slightly less irritating ) what a long 30 minutes it is . As for the rest of the film , it's no great shakes either , but at least something , no matter how inept or badly acted , is happening . Make no doubt about it , this horror / comedy stinks more then a year-old decomposing corpse .
521297	1162550	103090	1.0	a Time to change the channel	Traci Lords ( who as horrible as she is can still out act Sharon Stone almost any day of the week ) is Jackie , a photographer who finds herself being framed for possession of coke by a cop on the take . So she reluctantly teams up with another cop ( Jeff Conway , whom his role in Taxi grows more and more ironic throughout the years ) to clear her name . This movie is the definition of bad . Horrible acting , totally inept dialog , idiotic action sequences , and a script from Charles Kanganis all collide to make this travesty a must miss . Oh and Jackie has one of the most annoying kids this side of " Problem Child " and Richard Roundtree also has a small part as a police captain ( yes the early 90's were a horrid half decade for Shaft ) . Eye Candy : Nitchie Barrett gives the only two reasons to even think of subjecting yourself to this , but sadly nothing close to what she showed in " Preppies " Where I saw it : Showtime Extreme
520881	1162550	41891	1.0	one-sided BS out-dated propaganda	Horribly one sided , this propaganda piece spouts the supposed merits of inoculations ( whill conveniently NOT telling that those same shots can in some instances be MORE harmful than what they innoculate against ) I learned of THAT travesty first hand and it's a bitch . That part of the animated short made me so damn mad that it tainted everything that was said afterwords . Not only is this pure unadulterated propaganda crap , it's also EXTREMELY dated and isn't worth watching due to it's horrendous use of fear tactics . This animated short can be seen as an extra in the " From the Vaults " section on Disc 4 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2 .
519808	1162550	801349	2.0	chock full of filler	Dina Lo Bianca ( Lorin Becker ) is out of the assassination game until she gets a call about one last job . The price is right and she's back in the thick of it again in this action movie by Mark Vasconcellos . This film is filled so heavily with filler material , that it takes 94 minutes for what could've been a 75 minute film . See Becker surf , see Becker lounge around the pool , see Becker shower and bathe . See Becker NOT get nude while doing any of those aforementioned things , what a prick tease . Marginally good camera work , but a half-baked script and mediocre acting make this one a stinker .
520909	1162550	202470	2.0	NOT a metal movie	Marky Mark is the lead singer in a cover band and gets to play with the band he worships after the fire their lead singer in this dud ' inspired VERY loosely by ' the story of Tim Owens of Judas Priest . The basic story of guy craves fame , gets it , screws a transvestite , parties , loses girl , quits band to cut his hair and become a poof in a coffeehouse band , gets girl back , the end . There are so many things that don't work well in this movie . Jennifer Aniston is miscast . The ending is the biggest pile of horse manure . And you don't make a movie about metal and then have a lame soundtrack , among other things . Writer John Stockwell wrote Cheaters and Blue Crush so in retrospect it's no surprise that this movie blows . The only good parts were some of the acting , and that Zakk Wylde is in it . That's pretty much it .

520666	1162550	360361	2.0	Even the best Polonia brothers film is still crap	The Polonia twins are not only Among Us , they continue to unleash mind-blowing crap like this two ( sometimes 3 ) per year . Sometimes with budgets soaring up to tens of dollars . Having suffered ( barely ) through mind-numbing utter crap like " Holla if I Kill You " , " House That Screamed " , it's sequel , AND Hellspawn ( yes I know i'm masochistic ) , I came into this ' film ' expecting the worst . And i'm happy ( happy being used quite loosely indeed ) to inform you that those particular expectations were met quite nicely . From the dreadful opening replete with endless minutes of fart noise to the endless shower sequences that features absolutely NO nudity . From the faux trailer and music videos to the horrendous sound ( music overwhelms the actors ' speaking at times ) . As craptacularly bad this tale of a struggling B-grade film maker who meets a real Bigfoot after making a career out of making horror films about the fabled creature is , it's actually one of the better efforts from Polonia , if you can believe it . This is due , in no small part , because the writer of it ISN'T a Polonia ( they just directed it ) this time around . Even with a good half of the film , if not more , is filler .
521214	1162550	427688	2.0	Dora the explorer ( of really crappy kills )	After a quasi-Gothic , all-fruity music video , the movie starts with Cassidy the lead singer killing herself . In a perfect world that would be that and the end credits would roll . We don't live n that world . The insipid band members decide to go to some clown to contact her dead essence . When I say clown , I mean actual clown . He tell them they're all going to die via Cassidy's ghost ( the spirit possesses Dora , one of the band-mates ) We couldn't care less as the characters are all boring , vapid , and extremely horribly acted . Written by Adam Hackbarth ( an incredibly apropos surname if there ever was one ) , and directed by Corbin Timbrook ( who after The attendant , and Tower of blood , HAS to know that he keeps making crap for a living ) , this movie s a constant battle between the film's incompetence and the viewer's need to stay awake . Not enough blood to appease gore-hounds , nor enough nudity to satisfy pervs . This movie in fact has absolutely nothing to recommend to absolutely anyone .

Years later some local dweebs get together and throw a party in a nearby cabin . But good old Chris has escaped from the nut-hut to terrorize them . This ' Asylum ' outfit has produced 50 some movies , you'd think one of this would be actually watchable , right ? ? ? Well you'd be wrong as this film's as awful as all the other films under their banner . It doesn't help that Micheal Gingold's story is hopelessly contrived , dreadfully acted , and deathly dull . I don't mean to single out Gingold exclusively ( I'm still sore from suffering through " Leeches " ) . Oh no , the blame can be spread liberally from the director who has yet to make a decent film on down to the atrocious acting and further down to the sloppy editing and mediocre special effects . Awful with a resounding capital A . Eye Candy : Jan Anderson , Alicia Klein , Stephanie Medina , Erica Roby , and Amanda Ward all got topless . ( but you can see Stephanie's twin talents in the MUCH , MUCH better low-budget film " the Janitor " )
519643	1162550	113762	2.0	Why does the talented Englund continue to sign on for Tobe Hooper's crap ? ? ? ?	Wow , talk about an extremely apropo tag-line as indeed there IS a fate worse than death and that fate would revolve around having to watch this film ( or its unfathomable two sequels ) about a killer laundry folding machine that enjoys eating people . Horrible in nearly every aspect and isn't even unintentially funny , so the one enjoyment that could have been had is taken away from us . This was the worst thing I saw Robert Englund in since an episode of the inappropriately misleadingly titled " Masters of Horror " , funnily enough THAT was directed by Tobe Hooper as well . And I won't even mention " Night Terrors " . Mr . Englund , you're an amazing actor , now PLEASE never collaborate with Hooper ever EVER again , he's dragging you down , man . As for why I'm giving this more than just one measly star is ONLY to convey that " Troll 2 " is STILL the worst movie ever made . Where i saw it : Cinemax
521445	1162550	117710	2.0	Mark-Paul might be saved by the bell , but he needed to be saved by his agent	A child of extraterrestrial origins is found walking through the fires of a burning building . He's promptly adopted , but still has questions about where he came from . Years later , the boy , now a young man ( played by Mark-Paul Gosselaar of Saved by the Bell fame ) can start fires with his mind and frequently dreams of his forgotten earlier life while he submerges himself in bathtub water . Another alien ( Douglas O'Keeffe ) wants to get the young man back . With shades of much better films ( such as Firestarter , the Terminator , and even Starman ) , this movie can't help but epicly fail in comparison . It doesn't help that the film spots horrendous acting ( especially by Gosselaar and O'Keeffe extremely sub-par special effects , and a plot that is a clichéd muddled mess . This is one movie that makes those that are made for the Sci-fi channel ( I refuse to call it by the insanely stupid SyFy moniker , but that's another rant ) look of Oscar-caliber . That's no hyperbole , this movie is just that bad . Eye Candy : Carmelina Lamanna gets fully nude My Grade :
520495	1162550	1104006	2.0	It's apropos that a film about a demolition turns out to be such a devastating bomb	The O . C . ' s Mischa Barton stars as Sam Walczak , a demolition engineer whom first job is to demolish a building located in the desolate swamps of Scotland . Upon arriving she finds that the building isn't as empty as she was led to believe ( some tenants have inexplicably stayed ) , as well as the fact that the location may very well be haunted by the victims of the people that the architect of said building happened to entombed within it's walls . What started off as a slightly intriguing original story soon and all too readily devolved into a badly acted , scare-free , soap opera-ish . Barton does absolutely nothing to entice the viewer's waning interest and her co-stars ( some of whoms acting is laughably bad ) are not any better . Just when you think it can't get any worse , one of the characters ( who shall remain nameless as to avoid spoilers ) falls down a hole and it does . . . Perhaps with better acting , a more cohesive story , some scares and better directing , this film might have worthwhile to watch , as it stands now , that's sadly quite simply not the case . ( and don't even get me started on the ending )
519595	1162550	117188	2.0	No Contest that this is horrible	Shannon Tweed is back fighting terrorists , but this time Lance Henrikson fills in for both Rowdy Roddy Piper and Andrew Dice Clay . I prefer the first one , even though I like Henrikson as an actor . This one is tedious to sit through and not nearly as fun as the film that preceded it . The fights are put together in such a haphazard way that those are boring as well . Giving a casual glance to both the writers on this film , I shouldn't be surprised at how bad it was , as neither writer has done ANYthing even remotely good . Skip the snooze-fest . Rent the original instead , or better yet just watch the vastly superior Die Hard for the upturn time . My Grade :

Yeah neither am I ) Dead zombie cops , re-animated chickens I can buy . Joe Piscopo getting a paying job I'm sorry but my suspension of disbelief only stretches so far .

But the sad truth was that everything about this mess of a film is simply awful . From the porn-caliber acting to the lame ass comedy . The special effects ( aka . Gore ) was all right , but the rest of the movie was so bad that mere words can't convey how utterly disastrous it is . I thought that having the legendary Gunner Hansen AND legend H G Lewis would be a good sign and I'd find a diamond in the rough . Alas , no I couldn't have been more wrong . Avoid this film at all costs as it can only bring you misery . I consider myself a huge B-movie horror fan and even I loathed this film . That should tell you something .

Huge plot holes , faulty logic , an un-likable ' heroin ' and the fact that the movie just trudges on make this crime thriller awful . It's one of those direct to video flicks that you'd likely find early in the morning on cable , but even if you do stumble across it don't bother watching .

519835	1162550	413856	2.0	The short does for horror what G4 does for gaming . Makes it crap	Having some free time on my hands I decided to watch some short films on Atomfilms . " Blood Syrup " is about a guy who is weirded out by his syrup that he thinks is alive . That basically it . Oh and the Director and actors are all connected to G4 TV in some way , which should tell you something . Because no matter HOW noble a channel dedicated to video games may seem to you , if you ever tried watching any of the crap on G4 , you know the execution makes it simply unwatchable . Such is the case with this short actually . Did you like how I tied that all together and somehow managed to get the mandatory ten line requirement that IMDb has made mandatory ? Yea I do too : )

The plot just didn't click for me ( a problem no amount of money could've fixed ) and at even only 80 minutes running time my interest was wanning before it was even halfway though . The film is also heavily disjointed .

Perfectly healthy for most of his short life , he's now deathly sick in the hospital due to an overly enlarged pineal gland . his parents must figure out why exactly this is happening . But the small town they investigate happens to have some secrets itself . To make matters worse the tiny community is having some grisly murders happening in it . Not knowing if it wants to be a monster flick , possession film , mystery , or tacky melodrama causes the movie to be all over the map and leaves it disjointed and unfocused . The low caliber of melodramatic acting does help matters . I lost all interest in the film way before the end credits began to roll .

But when he later gets an unreleased record that holds the spirit of his dead ' metal ' idol . He first gets sucked into ideas of revenge , but then he doesn't want to take it as far as Sammi does . Which isn't really that far as his main victims only seem to go to the hospital . This movie is utterly laughable and has about as much to do with real metal as say , " Rock Star " . OK , maybe a tad more than that piece of junk , but you get my point . And how ANYone can root for a guy played by Skippy from " Family Ties " I haven't a clue . The cameo by Gene Simmons is OK , and Ozzy Osbourne reaches coherency , I applaud him for that , but otherwise skip this one .

521011	1162550	95756	3.0	Traci can act vertically too it seems	This remake from Roger Corman's own 1957 " Not of this Earth " . shares pretty much the some plot as the original . Alien comes to Earth from a far-off world to acquire blood for his dying race . The only updates are blood and breasts . Taci Lord's first mainstream acting role and I suspect it's because her fellow actors are just horrid , because she comes out as being good in it . If you don't plan on seeing this film with a six-pack at the ready , then my advice is DON'T . Also to have the stunning Monique Gabrielle in the film , but only in a bit part AND make her ugly is a travesty . Wynorski made some pretty good B-movies in the start of his career , but this isn't one of them . However comparing this film to the ones that he puts out today , it's a masterpiece . DVD Extras : Commentary with JimWynorski and Lenny Juliano ; Cast and crew Bios ; and Trailers for " The Doorway " , " Humanoids from the Deep " , and " Brain Dead " Eye Candy : Ave Cadell , Belinda Grant , Roxanne Kernohan , Becky LeBeau , Taaffie O'Connell , and last but not least Traci Lords all let loose massive mammories . Traci shows her rump as well . This film is huge hooter heaven ( say that three times fast )
520662	1162550	350754	3.0	a mess	Having some free time on my hands I decided to watch some short films on Atomfilms . " Dad's Dead " runs about 6 and a half minutes and is a tale of a boy and his childhood seemingly sociopath friend told in a blend of animation , real life , and photo stills . It seemed a wee bit artsy for my tastes and I found myself becoming uninterested in it before too long . If one can't hold the viewers attention for 6 mere minutes that , my friend , is a pretty big problem . But Kev , you say , it won so many awards . Aye , this is true , but I've never been to big on Awards that the industry gives out themselves . So that doesn't sway me on if something's good or not . This simply is not .
521137	1162550	395653	3.0	shrugs	This 23 minute and 42 second feature on the making of the Hulk movie that can be found on the 2nd disc of the 2-DVD special edition of " The Hulk " . It centers around the cast , the crew , the stunts and physical effects , ILM ( Industrial Lights and Magic ) work , and last but not least the music composed for the film . I didn't really care for some of the things that Ang Lee said in the featurette ( such as no one ever caring about Bruce Banner in the comic ) and myself being nonchalant about the film in the first place I wasn't really engaged with the 23 odd minutes that it took to watch this featurette .
520231	1162550	82801	3.0	Shocking bad for the director of Rocky , and the Karate Kid	Let's get the fact that this film isn't as much as a complete and total disaster as Belushi's earlier " 1941 " fiasco . Of course that being said is somewhat damning it with faint praise indeed . I keep hearing how this movie is a " classic black comedy " , well it's really none of those things . Extremely far from being classic in any way , shape , or form . As a black comedy " Heathers " runs circles around it . And even the word comedy can only be very loosely applied to this film . It may contain a chuckle or two , but thats the most you'll expect if you find yourself watching this absurdist Looney Tunes-esquire sloppily directed film about a couple ( Cathy Moriarty playing a nympho and Dan Aykroyd playing Bugs Bunny ) moving next to another more prudish couple ( John Belushi as Elmer Fudd and Kathryn Walker as his bitch wife ) . For absurd done right rent " Clue " instead and leave this on the video store bargain bin along with " 1941 " , " Doctor Detroit " , " D . A . R . Y . L . " , and " Rough Cut "
520141	1162550	1134826	3.0	is it good ? no not really	Aki arrives at a new school on the same day as a new zombie virus outbreak is starting due to a faulty vaccination . She must save the school . OK , not really that much of a story to this one , but you get a boatload of ultra-gore ( even if it's very cheesy and fake looking ) , frequent nudity , lesbianism & a laser vagina , what more can you expect from a Japanese film with this title ? ? Not really a good film by even the most lenient of traditional standards , however I found myself having fun with it ( to an extent ) . On the downside , even at less then an hour & a half , it does seem to go on a bit too long Eye Candy : Sasa Handa frequently shows T & A ; 2 other shows tits DVD Extras : the Region 1 DVD has no extras
520655	1162550	120912	3.0	Lame duck sequel	Agent J ( Will Smith ) now partnered with Agent T ( Patrick Warburton , Puddy from " Seinfeld " ) , after wiping out the memories of Agent K ( Tommy Lee Jones ) . When that partnership doesn't work out as planned , and with Agent J on a mission that he needs all the help he needs , he goes out to make agent K remember and partner up once again to foil the plans of an alien spore in the guess of a centerfold model . This film was an obvious attempt to cash in on a franchise . And it obviously worked since it made oodles of cash . But as a true movie , it's a lost cause as it's just more of the same of the first movie . Minus the originality , and even the minuscule amount of charm that the first one had . Instead really too much on sight gags and lame humor , sacrificing the story , as flimsy as it might be . Only worthy of a rental , simply for the " Chubbchubbs " short that is available on the same DVD . 2 disc DVD Extras : Disc 1 ) Commentary with director Barry Sonnenfeld with optional " Telestrator Diagrams " - feature ; access to the " behind the scenes " during the film ; " The ChubbChubbs !

519870	1162550	453453	3.0	Wastes the talents of Lange	Artie Lange can be extremely funny when he wants to as evidenced on Howard's Serius radio show , sadly that's not really in evidence in the fifty millionth " Bad News Bears " remake . Artie plays a character named Artie who's the pitcher of a pretty bad minor softball team who of course is in conflict with a rival better team . He also falls in love with the town slut . While still better than the atrocious " Beerfest " that came out around the same time , very few of the jokes hit it out of the park and i found myself getting very bored with the film quickly and checking my watch multiple times . Didn't help that one of the female characters voice was annoying enough to make me puncture my eardrums . Eye Candy : Multiple girls show skin during the bachelor party scene , but it's Keisha who's the real standout there
519648	1162550	105156	4.0	alright if you catch it in the right mood	Drew Barrymore plays a nameless teenage seductress given the nickname of ' Ivy ' who moves in with lonely , sexually confused adopted Sylvie Cooper ( Sara Gilbert of " Roseanne " fame ) and her family . It isn't long before she's seducing Sylvie's father ( Tom Skerritt ) , much to the chagrin of Sylvie . Barrymore is pretty good in this , and it was nice seeing her pre-coke stroke when her face was still symmetrical . Plus the film was competently , if VERY far from expertly by Katt Shea ( only notable otherwise for being topless in few B-movies ) . Cheryl Ladd is woefully underused as the put-upon mother and Sara Gilbert is tad too melodramatic in many of her scenes , but it's an alright movie , if you happen to be in the right mood whenever it plays on cable . Where I saw it : @ Max
521229	1162550	232500	4.0	Point Break on wheels	Bian O'Conner ( Paul Walker ) is an undercover cop who infiltrates a street gang that stages illegal street races in order to find out who's stealing expensive electronic equipment . He befriends the leader of said gang , Domenic Toretto ( Vin Diesel ) and finds himself falling for Dom's younger sister , Mia . The racing aspect of the film is pretty thrilling granted , but the story aspect of the film is way too derivative of 1991's " Point Break " , and this film can't help but suffers greatly from the comparison . Original Out of Print edition ( FAR superior to the ' Tricked out ' Special Edition ) DVD Extras : Commentary by Rob Cohen ; 18 minute Making of Featurette ; The article that inspired the movie ; 8 deleted scenes with optional director's commentary ; 8 multiple camera angles , plus the final edit for a stunt sequence ; Movie magic Interactive Special Effects featurette ; 4 and a half minute Featurette on Editing For The MPAA ; Visual Effects Montage ; 2 Storyboard Comparisons ; 3 Music Videos ( ' Furious ' by Ja Rule , ' POV City Anthem ' { Edited ] by Caddillac Tah , and ' Click Click Boom ' by Salivah ) ; Soundtrack spot ; a jump to the music menu ; Production notes ; cast & filmmaker bios ; Theatrical Trailer ; and promo spots for Universal Theme Parks & an Activision racing game 2 Easter Egg : There's a hidden steering wheel icon to the right of the Stunt sequence link on the main menu , click it for additional multiple angles ; A hidden steering wheel can also be found on page one of the ' Racer X Article ' DVD Rom : Wallpaper ; Screensaver ; Jukebox ; mini-game ; and an Activison Racing game demo
521009	1162550	94631	4.0	why don't the cops just carry water guns ?	In the future of 1991 , alien slaves are Newcomers to Earth . One of the filthy potato head slags kills Detective Syke's partner , he is then forced to partner with another slag , Sam Franscisco ( Mandy Patinkin , who never really found his way into much later with the great " Dead Like Me " ) . Talk about adding insult to injury . But I digress , in order to solve their first case , the have to work together despite their differences . A typical buddy / cop film despite the slags . Thankfully the film chooses to sprinkle the social commentary on race relations lightly on and the film's more about being an action movie . ( Sadly the subsequent TV series choose the opposite tact much to it's detriment ) . While it's not a great film by any means , the acting is merely serviceable ( James Caan being the only standout ) , the plot is VERY formulaic and clichéd . But it's an enjoyable enough time waster when in the right mode . Plus it's the most skin you'll likely see from Leslie Bevis ( and no she's not nude in this just the side )
520229	1162550	178845	4.0	only one good scenes	When the film started the first 4 minutes seemed like a travelogue of California , I was wondering if I got the tapes mixed up . Then I breathed a sigh of relief to see Paul Thomas in a scene with the lovely Joanna Storm and Laurie Smith . This is being spied on by Jimmy ( a young Tom Byron ) . Jimmy's aunt ( Honey Wilder ) is concerned about his behavior so she hires him a private teacher ( Kay Parker ) . I could do without the animal , robot role-playing , or the incest aspects . There's one good sex scene , between Byron and Parker , but it's not good enough to save this film .
521255	1162550	109761	4.0	his scalpel is dull and rusty	In the 1950's , young Julian witnesses his brother being murdered by a surgeon ( with the sounds of the Chordettes ' " Lollipop " none the less ) . Now all grown up he turns to stalking patients , of the hospital where he got canned for carrying on unlicensed experiments on regeneration , and killing them for fluid he needs to carry on his aforementioned experimentation . It's up to his ex , Theresa and her new ' flavor of the week ' Ben , to stop the carnage . Even with such heavyweight talents as Peter Boyle ( as a hardened cop ) and Malcolm McDowell ( as an ape-experimenting doctor ) in this film , it still can't overcome it's clichéd premise and story . Most of the acting is serviceable but somehow lacking , the killer is not all that memorable nor terrifying , and the tension was non-existent . I've seen a lot worse but this movie is still just too mundane to recommend to anyone . Screenplay writer Patrick Cirillo wound go on to pen the much better " Tears of the Sun " Eye Candy for the guys : Juliette Jeffers gets topless ; Isabel Glasser shows everything Eye Candy for the girls : James Remar's penis & ass
520209	1162550	366551	4.0	the PC stoner film	Harold and Kumar hit the road looking for Sliders from White Castle and weed . They encounter such " wacky " characters as racist jocks , wrongly imprisoned blacks ( well it IS a comedy after all ) , other stoners , and Doogie Houser . Directed by the same moron who made " Dude , Where's My Car ? " . Fortunately , it doesn't have the same writer . So this film is mildly amusing . . . MILDLY . I saw it because some people have called it un-politically correct . Of course , me being vastly against that train of thought , I thought what the hay I'll give it a spin . Well let me set that straight , this is a pretty damn PC comedy . Do I feel like my time was wasted watching it ? Nope , not really . It just wasn't nearly as good as I was led to believe . You can find way better ' stoner ' comedies , may I suggest any " Cheech & Chong " , " Dazed & Confused " , or " Half Baked " Eye Candy : Malin Akerman , and 4 other nobodies get topless
521233	1162550	667919	4.0	a rather pedestrian affair	When Ben Kohler ( Sam Robards ) gets an experimental brain transplant / chip implant after being shot in the head from point-blank due to a common mugging , he begins to see visions of what a murderer is seeing , but the murder can do the same thing to Ben . Turns out the doctor ( Jacob's Ladder's Elizabeth Peña ) who spearheaded the surgery isn't telling everything to a much bewildered Ben . Not particularly bad , but not that good either . The acting was alright , but the story has been told better in other films and TV shows . No variations on the theme to speak of in this episode .
520506	1162550	86078	4.0	this Raid wouldn't even stop bugs dead	Wendy ( Ginger Lynn ) gives a ride to Barry and Peter ( Jerry Butler and Jay Serling , respectively ) when they arrive in Hawai and can't rent a car . Barry bangs Wendy , but Barry won't have any part of it since he's just been dumped . This being an adult film it doesn't take Barry long to mend his heart at all . Ginger Lynn is always nice to watch ( in her porn films , at least . Her mainstreams ones are very spotty ) but she's really the only reason that I'd ever recommend this one . Even then just hesitantly . I'm just one of those people who just don't like much of Director Svetlana's output ( as evident in my reviews of " Miami Spice " and " Ultra Flesh " My Porn
520829	1162550	297181	4.0	I spy a terrible movie	In this dire remake of the mid to late 1960's Television series of the same name , Eddie Murphy takes over for Bill Cosby and Owen Wilson stands in for Robert Culp . In the version Kelly Robinson is an arrogant cocky boxer who is teamed up with less then stellar secret agent Alex Scott on a secret mission to recover a high tech stealth fighter plane . Unimaginative , unfunny , and VERY generic doesn't help this movie any . Eddie Murphy should just quit making movies while's he's far behind . Give his more talented brother , Charles some roles instead . He sinks Owen down . The 4 screenwriters ( yup it took 4 to come up with this crap ) sadly are not done with sub-par terrible re-makes . Nope not by a long shot , Cormac and Marianne Wibberley are making re-makes of " The Shaggy Dog " AND " I Dream of Jeanie " , while Jay Scherick and David Ronn are going to be held responsible for an all - black version of the Rodney Dangerfield classic " Back to School " . All 4 are a great examples of why Hollywood is a barren cesspool of unoriginal crap . DVD Extras : Both Widescreen & Fullscreen versions ; Commentary by director Betty Thomas , editor Peter Teschner , producer Jenno Topping , and writers David Ronn & Jay Scherick ; 4 featurettes ( Cloak and Camouflage , Gadgets and Gizmos , Schematics and Blueprints , and The Slugfest ; and Trailers for " Adaptation " , " Blue Streak " , " Formula 51 " , " National Security " , and " Punch Drunk Love " 1 Easter Egg : Highlight the motorcycle head light in the Extras menu for an interview with Eddie Murphy about boxing
520644	1162550	1090360	4.0	too much build up , for not enough payoff	Four goof balls go in search of Micheal Rockefeller , long presumed dead when he disappeared while on an expedition in Southwestern New Guinea , in hopes of getting a huge payday after they locate and interview the now legendary figure . They find that the locals are less than hospitable to put it mildly . The also must contend with petty bickering . . . . A LOT of petty bickering . In my opinion , the best films on the subject of cannibal natives are of the grind-house potboiler Italian variety . Movies such as Cannibal Ferox , Jungle Holocaust , and Cannibal Holocaust are extremist fare that any true horror buff can sink their teeth into . This film , on the other hand , while obviously hoping to capture the same unrelenting mood of said movies , can't help but come up short . That in and of itself is really not that surprising as even going into " Welcome to the Jungle " I pretty much knew that it wouldn't compare favorably to those infamous gore drenched films of yesteryear . Instead I decided to give it a chance on the sole reason that I like Jonathan Hensleigh's work for the most part . And while i couldn't really get behind this movie as I found too many parts of it outright boring thanks to severely under-developed characters . It's a bit too much build up for not enough payoff . Still , there ARE worse films out there and one could definitely feel that if the movie were in less capable hands that it would be much MUCH worse . DVD Extras : Commentary by writer / director Jonathan Hensleigh ; a 15 and a half minute Making of ; a deleted scene with optional commentary ; promo trailer for this film ; and trailers for " the Mist " , the atrocious " Halloween " remake ; " 1408 " ; " Black Sheep " & " Broken "
520278	1162550	63456	4.0	Arsonist meets a real fireball Lolita	Anthony Perkins plays Dennis Pitt , an arsonist who was recently parolled from a mental institution falls for Sue Ann ( Tuesday Weld , who most will remember from " Once Upon a time in America " and " Falling Down " , both superior films ) . He lures her into going out with him by concocting a ridiculous story of espenioge . But as things unravel and murder rears its ugly head , has Dennis gotten in over his head ? This film while not the out-right forgotten classic that previous reviewers have suggested , is still pretty good and deserves to be rediscovered . No real twists to speak of , but the acting is spot-on . This film was remade as a TV movie nearly 30 years later , THAT you should avoid . Where i Saw it : Thriller Max
520457	1162550	160184	5.0	Sadly Eye see this movie	From the Director of such " greats " as I Know what you did last Summer & Joyride , comes another failed Stallone come-back attempt . In this one Rocky himself is taken to a Detox clinic after he hits the bottle when his fiancé gets killed . But it seems the killer is there too . Naturly it's up to Stallone to save the day . If I could sum up this movie in one word , it would be ' uninvolving ' . If I had two words to describe the film it would have to be ' muddled mess ' But however I choose to describe it , the outcome is the same . Save your money , save your time . I knew who the killer was in record time , but it would've been better if Charles Dutton was the murderer , you know . . art imitating life and what not .

520123	1162550	273923	5.0	Well it's still the best live action movie from MTV films ( even if that's a dubious honor indeed )	Orange County native Shaun Brumder is a high school kid who wants desperately to go to Stanford to get away from the OC which he believes to be a detrimental environment unsuited for his writing abilities . After his guidance counselor sends in the wrong application causing him to be denied , he must take matters into his own hands to get in that school come hell or high water . There's a lot of things wrong with this film : It reeks of nepotism , with acting roles going to the son of Tom Hanks , daughter of Sissy Spacek , the Director being the son of Lawrence Kasdan . It also , like every other MTV project , relies way to often on ' flavor of the week ' music . And the storyline is pretty far from original . These three things are offset a tad by the great performance of Jack Black , however he's not given as much screen time needed to save this supremely mediocre production . DVD Extras : Commentary by Director Jake Kasdan and Writer Mike White ; 4 Deleted Scenes ; 15 Promo Spots ; and Theatrical Trailer

But strange experiments are being done on live sedated bodies somewhere on the premises . When she recognizes a corpse as the boy she met on the train there , she decides to snoop around . What starts of as a reasonably captivating little thriller derails completely by the third act and becomes a carbon copy of any other slasher film made , which is a shame as if the film just stayed on target , it would've been something special , as the acting was good into then and the camera-work was pretty good throughout .

He is soon caught . Tommy Lee Jones is L . T . Bonham , the man who trained Hallam is tasked with capturing him after he escapes from custody . Thus begins a cat and mouse game akin to " First Blood " in spirit if not in brilliance of execution . I guess that this movie was OK , but not really that memorable . Some tense scenes are overshadowed by glaring plot holes and a strong case of Deja vu . Friedkin's previous " Rules of Engagement " was MUCH better .

So now both man continue his experiments once more . But when a investigative journalist , Laura , whom Howard was having an affair with is killed and they take it upon themselves to bring her back using the re-animation formula with an addition of NEE , which is discharged from the brain at the moment of death , the feces really hits the fan . This third film in the series is OK , Jeffrey Combs as Herbert West still delights , but the absence of Bruce Abbot as his collaborator / foil , Dan Cain , is sorely missed . Tommy Musset just can't compare and the film lacks the sheer manic energy of the original or even " Bride " Eye Candy : Elsa Pataky shows very brief left nip ; Raquel Gribler shows better boobage DVD Extras : Commentary by director Brian Yuzna ; a 17 minute and 16 second Making of ; Music Video by Dr .

520822	1162550	301167	5.0	The trilogy ends not with a bang , but a whimper	In the last of a trilogy , Riki Takeuchi and Sho Aikawa are once again on the opposite ends of the spectrum , as they were in the first DOA , after being the best of friends in the second one . Riki is a cop searching for his son being held by a gang whom drifter Sho is a part of . Even though , if you think about it and put yourself in Miike's flow of logic , this ending film is inevitable in it's actions , it's still the less of the three . Of course no Takashi Miike film is totally without merit and such is the case here . There are a few setpeices that make it worthwhile , but the poetry I usually find in a Miike film is not found here ( at least in the amounts that I usually expect from this director )

Haven taken over Earth , now the Master sets his eye upon Universal conquest and it's come down to Martha to stop him . An overall solid & chilling episode of Doctor , sadly Who severely negated by a BS cop-out ending that left an atrocious taste in my mouth . Sad really as the two previous parts to this particular story were topnotch . Oh well , on to next series I guess .
520228	1162550	190774	6.0	still better than " Episode 1 and 2 " combined	Princess Layme ( Robin Cannes ) hires two bounty hunters to rescue her sister , Princess Orgasma ( Laurie Smith ) from evil Lord Balthazar , but will they be able to withstand the endless sex ' torture ' in this porno parody of " Star Wars " ? Written by Arthur King who also wrote the awful " Ten Little Maidens " , so I was pleasantly surprised that it didn't suck total ass even . Most of the humor works , but the constant flashing to mundane things during the sex scenes ( volcano eruptions , space , etc . . ) But you know what ? It's STILL better than those crappy Lucas-penned " Star Wars " prequels .
520436	1162550	106244	6.0	yea it's bad , but good at it	Set in the future , 4 convicts jump at the chance to get out of jail scott free ( plus use of the virtual sex fantasy machine ) by taking a space mission to recover a lost spaceship . Sounds simple enough , but a fiendish , yet sexy , alien in the guise of the form of Tracy Scoggins ( of latter day Babylon 5 and Crusade fame ) , has other plans for this gang of rapscallions . This movie will NOT win any awards for acting , for writing , nor will it win any accolades for special effects . But I've been known to enjoy a ' so bad it's good ' flick every now and then and this film has the feel of a Fred Olen Ray movie ( mind you , one that he use to make in the ' 80's , when his films were still entertaining ) . Plus ANY movie that lets Lando Calrissian hammily overact like this movie does HAS to be worth at least one viewing ; ) Eye Candy : Melinda Armstrong of the Bikini Summer films bares all , Tracy Scoggins unleashes her Babylon 2 as well as some ass to boot , and Gwen Somers show her breasts
519692	1162550	79540	6.0	Murray saves it	A typical summer camp film with the prerequisite fat guy , nerd , hot girl and the corny but fun-spirited song is saved by Bill Murray as Tripper Harrison the head counselor , making this film humorously enjoyable , if not laugh out loud funny . Not Murray best movie by a long shot , but an enjoyable enough time waster . Sadly Kristine DeBell who happily showed everything in the mid-70's sleaze classic " Alice in Wonderland " ( tis a pity , trust me ) Followed by three dire sequels , with the bottom of the barrel being the ' meatball ' the alien starring " Meatballs 2 "

If you're looking for any originality or something different , I suggest keep movie . But if you merely want a fun , solid little horror flick I say do yourself a favor and pick this one up . It's not without flaws ( it's a bit too long winded at over 2 hours , among other things ) , but it's entertaining none the less and it's a good deal better than the Director Jôji Iida's previous film " Rasen " ( which was a poor Ring sequel indeed ) DVD Extras : Fangoria article ; Theatrical Trailer ; and Trailers for " School's Out " , " Slashers " , " Wilderness " , " Angel of the Night " , & " One Hell of a Christmas "
520607	1162550	308152	7.0	Mick Cain ruined this one for me somewhat	A family and the daughter's boyfriend is on a drive to visit their mom's parents house , when the father ( superb Ray ' Leland Palmer ' Wise ) decides to take some back roads . When they pick up a mysterious lady in white ( the stunning , Amber Smith ) and leave the daughter behind to catch up , all hell seems to break lose . The uber-annoying son ( Mick Cain ) who listens to Marilyn Manson making homophobic remarks tended to strike me as a bit queer ( no pun intended ) . Speaking of the son , he was the main reason that I didn't find this film as good as I should have . But it does have a few effective scares , none the less , even if you do have to dodge a few plot holes . Eye Candy : only Amber Smith's backside
520563	1162550	87656	7.0	I remember this one being hot	Traci Lords as Jackie and Tom Byron as Bill have car trouble and or stranded out in nowhere . They walk until they come to this house owned by Eric Edwards as Jake and Ginger Lynn Allen as Louise . They beckon the hapless couple to spend the night and introduce them to the other couples . So naturally this calls for an orgy . This review being mostly out of memory , , that and wall to wall sex almost is all I remember , oh and there's a supernatural horror twist . As I recall , when I saw it back in the day , it was VERY hot indeed . But who knows , maybe that's looking back with rose-tinted glasses , seeing as Tracy starred in it I highly doubt I'll get a chance to go back and see if it was as good as I seem to remember it being .

Which served to carry on into the Christmas special where we learn her name , Donna , and back story . Perhaps this is because the character of Rose was such an integral part of Doctor Who since the latest incarnation , perhaps it's because I found Donna to be quite annoying for the first 20 or so minutes of this special , perhaps because the first half seemed to be a bit of fun , but insubstantial fluff . In all probability a combination of the three aforementioned gripes , but I couldn't help but feel that this wasn't as good as last year's special . Not to say it was bad at all , on the contrary it DID pick up steam greatly after the first 20 minutes and I ended up enjoying it overall . Still I'm glad that Tate isn't going to be the next companion . I can't wait for the new series ! !
520787	1162550	71276	7.0	A would-be franchise that sadly wasn't	Master swordsman Captain Kronos ( Horst Janson of " Murphy's War " , " Shout at the Devil " , and " escape from East Berlin ) , along with his trusted hunchbacked assistant , searches for a vampire or vampires whom have been sucking the woman of a small town dry , in this swashbuckling vampire-hunting later day Hammer film . It's an interesting one to say the least and one could tell that it might have started a franchise if only the timing was right , but alas it wasn't and it turned out to sadly be one more nail in the coffin of Hammer's eventual demise . A shame really , as this was one of their better offerings of their last years .

520038	1162550	249355	7.0	Better than " For Ladies Only "	In his fifth comedy special Andrew Dice Clay is still funny but the special still doesn't hit the heights of " Dice Rules " as the best Diceman special ever in my opinion , " The Diceman Cometh " You get a tad less than an hour of comedy after the lackluster boxing opening skit . His best jokes of course revolve around various sexual acts as well as making fun of selected audience members . Sadly a few ' topical ' jokes makes this special somewhat dated . But it IS a good return to form after the lackluster " For Ladies Only " special . Eye Candy : a female audience member quickly flashes
520441	1162550	369884	7.0	an average featurette about a great film	This 16 minute 38 second documentary features interviews with actor Tomas Millia and Director / Co-writer Sergio Sollima . The featurette covers all the bases about the film , but as with the Featurette found with the " Django Kill , if you live shoot " DVD , I found myself interested only when Tomas Millian was talking . He laments Donald O'Brian's passing , talks of the other actors , other antidotes about the making of the film , his love of song , and in a humorous moment exclaims about how Bleeping talented he is . This documentary can be found as an extra on the " Run , Man , Run " disk of the Blue Underground Spahetti Western DVD collection .
520001	1162550	300471	7.0	Almost as good as " Noon " , but not quite	Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan are back again as Roy O'Bannon and Chon Wang , this time traveling to London to avenge Chon's murdered father . Also Chon's sister , Lin ( Fann Wong ) , is added to the mix as a potential romantic interest for Roy . While " Knights " isn't as good as the previous " Noon " , it's entertaining enough and never seeks to be more then it is : A mindless action / comedy . It's a lot better than Jackie's ' other ' franchise sequel , Rush Hour 2 " . Having enjoyed this film , it just makes my hopes for David Dobkin's next directed movie , " the Wedding Crashers " . My Grade : B DVD Extras : Commentary with David Dobkin ; Second Commentary with Alfred Gough and Miles Millar ; Fight Manuel ; Action Overload ; 11deleted and extended scenes ; Trailers for " Bringing Down the House " , " The Recruit "
519700	1162550	95125	7.0	One of Franco's best	A coke addicted fashion model is abducted by a notable plastic surgeon after a patient her scarred throws acid in the face of his beloved . He's trying to reconstruct her face with those of other girls . The fashion model's father sends Sam Morgan , his war buddy and now a private investigator to find his daughter . One of Franco's best films , it has the benefit of being coherent and not unwatchable , putting it in the class of Jess Fronco films that only number less then a handful . The presentation is nice EXCEPT the last line of Telly Savalas is in French for no reason all . DVD Extras : Sub-titled Commentary with Jess Franco and Lina Romay ; Partial commentary with Chris Mitchum ; Interviews with Jess Franco , Caroline Munro , and Chris Mitchum ; Photo gallery ; Theatrical Trailer ; Trailers for " Flesh for the Beast " , " Virgin of Nuremberg " , and " Bronx Warriors " Eye Candy : a couple breasts

The conversation itself is engaging and flows nicely , but the scenes out of the restaurant , though not without merit ( David Cross , Jack Black , and Maura Tierney , have good parts in said parts ) , tend to mess up the flow of the film somewhat . And based on the film I'd be interested in seeing the play . DVD Extras : Commentary by Bob Odenkirk , Micheal Blieden , and cast members ; Second Commentary by Odenkirk , Blieden , the producers , composer , and Cinematographer ; " The Frank International Film Festical " ( a funny 15 minute skit ) ; Scenes from the stage play Phyro-Giants !

The story is as simplistic as the first , yet focuses on more of the twisted comedy of it which apparently consists of dick , fart , vomit , and semen gags . Infantile humor , sure , but I got a kick out of it . The film as a whole is awash in tastelessness , but I love politically incorrect films so I found it right up my alley , at least it was better then the stuff that Troma's been putting out lately . Besides if there's a place in the world for horror as art like " Let the Right One In " ( rightfully so as that film's brilliant & puts crap like " twilight " to shame ) then there should be room for the flip side of that : Mindless drunken fun horror films ( this one being of course firmly in the latter category ) So sit down with a six-pack or two ( or 5 ) , some like-minded friends & just sit back & enjoy . Although I still maintain that a better name for the film would have been " Feast 2 : the Second Cumming " Eye Candy : Diane Goldner shows her right tit ; Amy McGee shows her ass ; Chelsea Richards and Melissa Reed both go topless ( there's also nudity in the Making-of featurette on the DVD ) DVD Extras : Commentary by Director John Gulager , Writers Patrick Melton & Marcus Dunstan , Producer Michael Leahy , and Actors Diane Ayala Goldner , Tom Gulager & Clu Gulager ; a 12 & a half Making of featurette ; a 5 & a half minute ' Meet the Gulagers ' featurette ; and trailers for " Hell Ride , " " Mother of Tears , " " The Zombie Diaries , " & " Diary of the Dead .

519711	1162550	124406	7.0	Interesting hybrid porn	Nate ( Richard O'Neal ) goes off on a cattle drive , not before having sex with his wife , Sarah ( Barbara Bourbon ) , of course . After 3 escaped convicts rape her , steal her three nubile daughters and then flee , leaving her strung up by her hands , she of course wants revenge . So when a rag-tag posse chasing the convicts rescue her , she insists on traveling with them . This is a curious film , as a porno / western hybrid , it's the first of it's kind that I've seen . Some may be put off by the highly exploitative showing of rape and incest . But I found myself actually drawn into and interested in what would happen next . The film is a further example of how porn films now shot on video , just don't seem to cut it ( barring , of course , the way above average output of Directors Micheal Zen , Brad Armstrong , and few others ) My Porn
519875	1162550	602155	8.0	one of the better episodes of the series	Jimmy and Ron are two ex-convicts who hide out in what they believe to be a vacant model house where there's also money to be found for the taking . Things don't go as planned as they find that the house isn't quite so empty with a family living there . This episode is among the best of the series , thanks in no small part to the acting talents of James Remar as the homicidal Ron , he brings such a ferocious power to his role , that one can't help but be on the edge of your seat for most of the duration of the episode . And yes it's really that good . The twist ending is pretty damn cool to boot . This is one of the episodes that can be found on disc 2 of Volume 1 of the US release . It also has optional commentary by director Carl Schenkel .
520414	1162550	602150	8.0	one of the best episodes of the series	When Debby Hunt begins cheating on her novelist husband Jeffrey ( Willem Dafoe ) with his publicist Tony of all people , he decides to fake his own death in order to achieve immortality in the literary world and attempt to reconcile his ailing relationship . This doesn't sit well at all with the two adulterous lovers who vow to kill him for real . I enjoyed this episode a lot and had fun with the twists and turns of the story to say any more would spoil a delightful little tale , so i won't . But suffice it to say , if only all or even half of the series was as good as this one was then the show would have been a bonifide classic as opposed to the mild cult classic success that it currently enjoys . This is one of the episodes that can be found on Volume 1 of the US release of the Hitchhiker . It also has optional commentary by Director Carl Schenkel who has pretty much nothing at all to say making it one of the worst commentary tracks that I've ever heard in my life . Eye Candy : Dayle Haddon shows T & A , as well as a rather quick full frontal

520451	1162550	43479	8.0	no the best , but funny none the less	Daffy Duck along with comedy sidekick Porky Pig go to a old west town only to discover the local sheriff is dead . So Daffy becomes the new sheriff and has to fend with the likes of Nasty Canasta . While not among the best of Looney Tunes that I've seen , it's still pretty good . Also it's nice to hear Porky's last line which is cut whenever the short airs on television . I never really understood that , by the way , you have gun play throughout the short AND an implied joke of panther's urine , but a joke about cleaning up horse poo is a no no ? ? Now that IS looney . This funny cartoon is on Disk 2 of the " Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 1 " . It also has an optional commentary track as well as a music-only track .

Bogart wants fried rabbit , so Elmer chases Bugs around in hopes of making him dinner . Half the fun is the chase and all the shenanigans that entails . The other half is spotting all the personality parodies . There's Bogert , Grocho Marx , and Lauren Bacall , of course . But there's also Leopold Stokowski , Gregory Peck , Ray Milland , Frank Sinatra , Sydney Greenstreet , and Carmen Miranda . This animated short can be seen on Disc 1 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2 . It also features an optional commentary by Micheal Barrier .
521265	1162550	443113	8.0	Interesting	This 39 minute documentary can be found on the two disk Divamax Special Edition DVD of " Dawn of the Dead " . I don't recommend you watch it BEFORE you see the actual film , as it contains massive spoilers , but it's a very good supplement to watch after you see the film . It tells you how the script was MUCH huger then the budget would eventually allow . As well as going into casting , talking about the mines , the extras , and go into the special effects . It also features interviews with most of the main cast and a lot of the crew . It's a good documentary and at times better then the movie itself .
519991	1162550	845046	8.0	nice heartfelt little film	This modestly budgeted coming-of-age film succeeds in impressing due in no small part by the young , but genuinely good acting by Will Poulter and to a slightly less effect ( but still good ) Bill Milner . I was able to avoid the hype of this little film and as such didn't have huge expectations from it , this helped me to enjoy it all the more . If you enjoyed old John Hughes films , you'll find much to like in this heart-felt one . DVD Extras : Commentary with Garth Jennings , Nick Goldsmith , Bill Milner , & Will Poulter ; a 26-minute Making-of ; Garth's short film " Aron " ; Son of Rambow website winner ; and Trailers for " American Teen " , " the Duchess " , " the Love Guru " , " Shine A Light " , & " Drillbit Taylor "

While step-daughter , Connie ( Adult film mainstay and Farrah Fawcett look-a-like , Rhonda Jo Petty ) , goes out looking for lust . Oh who am I kidding ? This one doesn't have a plot to summarize , but the sex scenes are pretty hot and look for a young leaner Ron Jeremy , before he became a fatter caricature of himself . Plus Miss Petty is always hot .

Upon arriving he finds an attorney to show his numerous patents to , thus making him a very wealthy creature indeed and starts him on the way to getting the profit needed to build a return spaceship . Rip Torn is a aging college professor who is growing tired of teaching and banging his students , yearning for more . The path of these two will converge soon enough . Nicolas Roeg is a pretty challenging director practically daring the viewing to come to their on opinions on his style . Not really seeming to give a damn about the commercial aspects ( or lack there of ) of the movies that he makes . And although I found it much easier to form an opinion on this one than say " Walkabout " ( which I'm still on the fence with to this day ) , I found it harder to decipher than his later " Insignificance " , which stuck me quite quickly that it was . . well . . . insignificant . Due to the superb performances of Rip Torn and Bowie ( in the role of his life ) I found myself liking this one more than not . It is equal parts compelling , engaging , frustrating , beautiful and difficult . DVD Extras : Disc 2 ) the 24 minute documentary " Watching the Alien " ; Poster and Stills gallery ; Talent Bios for Nicolas Roeg and David Bowie ; 2 TV Spots ; 2 US and 1 International Theatrical trailers ; and US and international teasers DVD-ROM : the Original Screenplay in .

But for true fans of the exploitation genre it falls in the top 5 of all time . Yes , some scenes are hard to sit through . Yes the subject matter is tasteless . Yet nearly 30 years after it's releases it's STILL being talked about . For such a low-budgeted picture like this is just amazing . For the squeamish among you STAY AWAY from this movie . All others proceed with caution . DVD Extras : Commentary by Producer David F . Friedman , Director Don Edmunds , star Dyanne Thorne & humorist Martin Lewis ; Theatrical Trailer ; Bios for David F .

This short revolves around the attempted capture of said pygmy . This Tex Avery directed , Heck Allen written short , sadly won't get much airplay in the least anymore because of racial stereotypes ( at one point they lure the black pygmy out with watermelon ) . Which is a shame as the cartoon as a whole is pretty funny . But such is the way in this sadly politically correct world that we live in . Bash Catholics , Christians , white men , or heterosexuals and it's seemingly OK . But innocent cartoons for the most part are banned and white-washed . It's a shame really . My Toon

Starting when Van Damme insulted Zito and ending in the fight , I found the story fascinating , captivating , and at turns humorous to listen to listen to . He also goes briefly into his love life and takes a few phone calls . But the episode mostly revolve's around the Van Damme incident . Needless to say , Zito proves to be a pretty good interview and it kept me entertained throughout .

Are her dreams real or just in her head ? I'm not telling , just watch the film . All the women are hot , the film has HOT sex scenes and it has an interesting story to boot . It was supposed to be the next big thing from Vived pictures after Jenna Jameson's excellent " Dreamquest " . And while it is pretty damn good and a film I'm glad to have in my small adult movie collection , It still doesn't reach the greatness that made " DreamQuest " so very phenomenal . My Adult Film

It goes into detail about the origins of the movie , how they had to re-write the screenplay multiple times , the psychological aspect of the film , how they choose to update the werewolf myth . Joe Dante talks about " Hollywood Blvd . " and " Piranha " briefly , as well as the casting of the various actors and actresses . Dee Wallace comes off as a bit of a loon . And much more . I liked this documentary , you can watch it in 5 parts or in one lump sum . It was MUCH better then the 8 minute promo piece that's on the same disk .

Coyote and the Road Runner is still good and features many gags that work , including the Coyote dressing up as a woman hitch-hiker , a hot-air balloon , and the old paint a road gag . The ending is a tad too much like the ending to the first cartoon , but I can simply watch ANY cartoon with the pairing of these two and be endlessly entertained every single time . It's something that I can't truly explain to anyone who isn't a fan . But those who get it know what I'm talking of .

His raving on said plain gets him and a few others kicked off . Having missed the flight we see that Alex's premonition was fulfilled . Bu the thing is Death doesn't like to be cheated in this good horror movie . Glen Morgon and James Wong are two gifted guys in my eyes , and barring the mis-step that was " The One " , I've enjoyed their film and TV work immensely . This film is one of the best in the admittedly tiresome ' Teen horror ' sub-genre . If only the sequel wasn't such ass .

She spies two people going at it , Jack ( the star of most of the films in the " Talk dirty to Me " series ) and Rikki Blake , and naturally is enthralled . She falls for Jack of course . But her limited vocabulary and no one believing Jack when he says she's a mermaid is the source of " humor " It's not really funny , just annoying . But the sex scenes are good , plus Traci , Ginger Lynn , Amber Lynn , and a pre-enhanced Bunny Bleu are all hot . This is the most sought after of the films in the series by porn fans , because of the rarity of the original picture after Ms . Lords outed herself as underage . My Porn

And the only way to save her is through rampant sex . Gary Graver , who has been lacking in more recent year , had a ultra-campy classic with this one . Pretty good sex scenes in this one and even though technically it is a Barbare Dare film , Nina Hatley gets the best sex scenes it , although the last scene gives her a run for the money .

Ironically enough after the two collabreated on " Hollywood Scream Queen Hot Tub Party " , neither's subsquesent movies were as entertaining . But I Digress , anyway this Wynorski film is about 5 girls doing inventory and stumbling on a puzzle box that contains the spirit of the guy from " Sorority House Massacre 2 " , but featuring clips from " Slumber Party Massacre " So of course they take turns showering , making insipid comments , running around in lingerie , and getting killed by a maniac . In short , great cheesy goodness .

The chemistry between Gavin & Stacy seems to be spot on . Despite Nessa & Smithy ( Series Co-creators James Corden and Ruth Jones ) providing the quasi-raunchy jokes ( which frankly are hilarious in their own right ) , the series seems to have created a sweet , often humorous aura that I found quite intoxicating . Brilliant first episode . One that definitely won me over .

The perpetually inebreiated man wastes no time in making Shatner uncomfortable , constantly harassing him that " you BETTER get these questions right , Bill " . It's hilarious seeing Shatner's reaction & hearing Artie's quips & impersonations of Jeff . Tabitha is understandable relunctant , but proves that she's a trooper for Howard , later we see the fateful ' date ' ( well the start and end of it anyway ) We only hear the rest ( thankfully , as Jeff is far from easy on the eyes ) This is another great episode .

All he has to do is whistle whenever he's getting attacked by Tom the cat , and spike will be right their to pummel Tom . At first it works superbly but after Tom gives Jerry a jawbreaker covered in glue Jerry finds that he can no longer whistle . This short has some great sight gags . And while Spike might seem a bit thick-headed and dense I enjoyed it immensely . This cartoon can be found on disc one of the Spotlight collection DVD of " Tom & Jerry "
520624	1162550	370244	9.0	Outstanding	The third film I got to watch at the philly film fest was this outstanding drama from Japan . After breaking out of prison nine escaped convicts plan to find the " key to the universe " that a tenth convict who didn't break out told them about . Along the way we get to know each of these men fairly well . Each has their own dreams . For much of the movie it seems to be mostly a comedy , but a shift takes place that the film ends up a tragedy . All of the actors give great performances . I can't say much more without spoiling the film , but suffice it to say that you end up feeling for some of these individuals . At 2 hours , this film is a tad to long , but good none the less . I have no qualms recommending it with the warning that it does have a bit unsettling violence for the tender-hearted . Toshiaki Toyoda hit a home-run this time out , and it makes me want to search out his prior films as well as look forward eagerly to his future ones .

One of the very few problems I had with Innocent Blood is the lack of in depth characterization , but that's remedied here in spades . Filled to the brim with the joys , heartbreaks , and wonder of childhood . the movie is universal in it's appeal and a true joy to behold . One of my favorite foreign coming-of-age films . This only solidifies the nothing that Miike can do much more then the violent , bizarre films that he's primarily known for .

This short won an Oscar for best cartoon short subject in 1952 and it's easy to see why as it's clever , humorous , and just an all around joy to watch . Utterly brilliant in every way and it retains it's humor upon repeated performances despite the slightly disturbing ending . One of the many many classic Tom and jerry animated shorts .

519698	1162550	362270	10.0	yet another brilliant film by Wes Anderson	Steve Zissou ( Bill Murray ) a Jacques Cousteau-like aquatic documentarian whom has lost his prestige somewhat , goes on an expedition of revenge to kill a shark who had killed his friend and Team Zissou partner , Esteban . He has to deal with his aloof wife ( Anjelica Huston ) , the son he didn't know of Ned ( Owen Wilson ) , Klaus ( Willem Dafoe ) who's jealous of Ned , Jane ( Cate Blanchett ) a interview , and his chief nemesis , the supremely cocky and arrogant , Alistair ( Jeff Golblum ) . I adore Wes Anderson pictures and he has yet to make one that is less than stellar in my eyes . All the actors are simply splendid and well done . I still like " Rushmore " more , but this is still a great movie . It not only holds up but gets better on subsequent viewings . Eye Candy : Robyn Cohen is frequently topless DVD Extras : Disc 1 ) Commentary by Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach ( great , but the bleeping out of Jacques Cousteau's name was distracting ) ; an episode of " Starz on the set " ; 9 Deleted scenes ( with more eye candy ) ; and theatrical Trailer Disk 2 ) Behind the scene photos ; ' the Look Aquatic ( a 5 and a half minute interview with the production designer ) ; Creating a scene ; a 19 minute interview with Devo member Mark Mothersbaugh ; ' Mondo Monda ( a spoof Spanish talk show interview ) ; Intern video journal ; a piece on the costumes ; ' This is an Adventure ' ( a 51 minute documentary ; Interviews with Seymour Cassel , Cate Blanchett , and Owen Wilson ; a visual effects piece ; design pictures ; and 10 songs of David Bowie as song by Seu Jorge ( great stuff ) Easter Eggs : Disk 1 ) Highlight a hidden arrow in the bottom-right room of the Belafonte for outtakes of Bill Murrey jumping and jogging in place Disc 2 ) highlight an arrow by the Criticon Logo for an introduction to the disc in Spanish ; highlight an arrow near the seaweed for a clip of Albert Maysles golfing My movie Grade / DVD grade :
520715	1162550	420995	10.0	good	This thirty minute documentary is located on the Punisher DVD and covers pretty much everything you would want to know about the shooting of the movie , as well as scouting the locations and pre-production . I for one would have liked to see the Kuwait footage realized , as well as the scenes of Frank Castle's black partner re-instated . ( hopefully in the upcoming director's cut , i guess ) But then again I'm an umber-fan of the Punisher character and besides if certain movies starring a young practicing wizard can be nearly 3 hours long then the Punisher film could have been as well . C'Mon , does anyone hear me on that one ? ? LOL
520795	1162550	44404	10.0	Fantastic	This second pairing of Wile E . Coyote and the Road Runner is a great as the first . Predictable maybe , but I don't care and still laugh so much whenever I see it . The Wile E . / Road runner shorts always had the most special place in my heart . So knowing that the second disc of the Golden Collection would not only feature 11 of this , BUT they would be in chronological order ( 2 through 12 , the first episode was on Volume 1 ) , made me get misty eyed . I LOVE this stuff . This animated short can be seen on Disc 2 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2 . It also features an optional commentary by Micheal Barrier .
