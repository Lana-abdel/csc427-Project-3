Padded with footage from " Planet of the Dinosuars " and horrible jokes this is definitely one to miss . The acting is atrocious as well , and while this isn't as bad as " Chickboxer " ( what movie can be ? ) This is still pretty awful repugnant stuff . It's 90 minute running time feels like an eternity and you will likely be cursing life so do yourself a huge favor and just move on , skip this crappy film , there's nothing to see here .

521284	1162550	338325	1.0	brainless action without the action part of that equation	Bo Laramie , a rising Hollywood star , unaccustomed to the EVIL paparazzi and their EVIL ways , have to combat the EVILness when he stops in the middle of a busy highway and causes a fatal car accident , but only because of those EVIL paparazzi , did I forget to say they're EVIL ? ? Well don't worry , this movie will pound that point into your head too . It's hard to know where to start with this one . Do I rag on how some things can be painted black and what , but Paparazzi are NOT high on that list . Do I mention Dennis Farina's poor man's Columbo impersonation in the film ? or do I talk about the excessive and totally needless reliance on celebrity cameos ( Vince Vaughn , Chris Rock , Matthew McConaughey , Mel Gibson himself , anyone from the E ! channel ) . Speaking of E ! , do I mention the laughable sequence when they're portrayed as hard hitting news journalists ? Or do I just offer the cursory statements of how awful the acting , story , and " plot logic " were ? As you can see , I'm in quite the pickle here . So many bad things to point out , so little time . I'll merely settle on telling you that the movie stinks and leave it at that . I think I've gotten my point across somehow .
520143	1162550	897444	1.0	among the worst of the zombie sub-genre has to offer	50 years after a zombie infiltration a small group of nomadic survivors are still fighting the undead ghouls who've gotten smarter and kidnap nubile young women to feed off of . Two brothers save some girls from the ghouls , and one of the guys falls in love with one of them who he nicknames Star . Trouble ensues when the zombies follow them back to their camp . It's been awhile since I've seen a David Prior film ( 1986's Killer Workout ) So it was time to put my prejudice of that film aside , perhaps he took a turn for the better within the intervening two decades . I always give people the benefit of the doubt . After watching this movie , he good knew is he did take a turn , the bad news is it's definitely not for the better . This film is amateur hour from start to finish . Grade school special effects , combines with hideously stunted dialog , terrible acting & shoddy camera work . This makes his previous Killer Workout look like a masterpiece by comparison . DVD Extra : trailer for this film
520150	1162550	435729	1.0	poor , poor Hauser	After the offspring of an inbred redneck union of brother and sister is ditched in the fields of nowhere , a fellow God fearing redneck finds her and she grow up as a pet would . Twenty years later , a group of young adults on vacation in the mountains find that trouble is a brewing from the town folk hicks who are addicted to psychedelic eggs ( which one of the gang partakes in ) after an altercation in a strip-club . The film also boasts a cameo by the great Wings Hauser as Wings Hauser ( DON'T call him Hasselhoff ) , don't get your hopes up as he's in it all of three minutes ( if that ) Wow , this movie was extremely bad ( even for a Troma film ) not one character acted one iota resembling anything a normal person would act like . Without relating to any of them in any way , shape , or form , it made the hour and a half go by extremely slowly and i found myself looking at my watch on numerous occasions . I'm one of those people who HAVE to watch a movie till it's finish once I start it . On occasions such as this , that trait is quite the curse indeed . As for Mr . Hauser , well we all need money from time to time , so I won't hold it against him . . . . . just this once . Eye Candy : Natalie Hays & Rachel Wagner both provide the T & A ; an extra gets topless

You're strippers dammit , not brainy philosophers ) , footage of Meyer's own " Europe in the Raw " , as well as screen test footage of of Lorna Maitland in Russ Meyer's " Lorna " Probably my forth least favorite Russ Meyer's film , ahead of " Pandora Peaks " and his two Studio films ( " Beyond the Valley of the Dolls " and " The Seven Minutes ) No plot , dancings OK , but WAY too much yakkity yak .

His father warns that Death will be riding behind him . Needless to say , a masked guy with a Death license plate does indeed ride behind him . He goes after the likes of The Boogyman , Bucko the Clown , Light Bulb , and various other riff-raff . I feel that nearly any subject matter can be filmed well , if the Director of said subject matter is talented , or at the very least competent . But in this instance the Director Charles Cullen seems to possess neither of those traits . And as suck , those who have the misfortune to suffer through this are in for the longest 70 minutes of your life .

Well i caught this " movie " ( note the quotation marks ) on a DVD released by Sub-Rosa that also had " Cutthroats " on it , it also had a short on it , but my DVD player broke down before I got to see it ( must have gotten good taste ) . I started Loons hoping for the best , which i do for all independent films . I sat through the Prologue in utter disbelief . it was 15 of the most mind-numbing , cringe-inducing piece of excrement that I have ever been subjected to . After 15 MINUTES the titles begun playing . . the opening titles . I thought to myself ok , now it'll get better , because it can't get worse . . I was wrong . I was SO VERY wrong . I have no idea how long this was , it felt like hours upon hours upon hours on end . with NOTHING happening , the " movie " just was running in circles just like some mongoloid puppy that is missing it's left front leg & a tail . The " movies " about some curse that makes Loon men crazy . Get It Loon ? ? Thats the extent of the " humor " Upon ending the film , i choose to watch the second feature on this DVD . . was it good ? ? Stay tuned for part two ( CutThroats ) I'll give you a hint on the answer . . . HELL NO ! ! !

For some reason some people want to kill her . hmmm , I can't imagine why , she writes of how utterly corrupt the country is and then GOES BACK THERE ON A BOOK TOUR ! ! Dumb poota . So after her best lesbian friend gets kidnapped ( not before sharing a tender moment with Maria , of course ) , she has to go save her . The post-recorded dialog was immensely distracting and annoying , and the plot is hopelessly convoluted . One of the worst Franco films that I've seen .

519807	1162550	1239450	1.0	my god the horror , the horror	After a simply awful monologue about the ferocity of bull sharks and an equally putrid shark attack , we're ' treated ' to about 2 and a half minute of nothing but footage of sailboats ( seriously I timed it with my mouth hanging open , dumbfounded with each passing minute , not to be out done the ending 4 minutes are nothing but a view of the ocean , but I digress ) . The movie is about the aforementioned bull shark ( oh and when we do see this thing , it appears to be a rubber toy shark of the 2 dollar variety ) attacking various people at a marina where a sailing race is going to be held . Billed as a comedy , this doesn't even work well as that . There's a reason that I seem to be the first ( hopefully only ) person to comment on this film on this site , it's atrocious and I wouldn't wish it to be watched even by my worst enemy . It's also one of the few films that I'm very thankful that the actresses kept their clothes on throughout .
520948	1162550	82933	1.0	Sludge	Poor , poor Sam Neill , a pretty solid actor in a piece of crap movie . Words to describe this " movie " would include melodramatic , overacted , pretentious , and for a large part of the overlong two hour running time so deathly boring . The perfomances are SO over-the-top . But hey , I hear the French LOVE this film . So it can't be all bad right . . . wait , wait yes it can . Before someone pipes in to say " oh , he must have not ' got ' the film " , keep in mind , that I ' got ' Naked Lunch a FAR superior film . Oh yeah , it seems that mass hysteria from the movie has carried over to the rating some IMDB users gave this cinematic waste .

Did I thrust 4 railroad spikes completely through my head and live to tell the tale ? Well , no ( but that would've been less painful in hindsight ) , I saw the new Happy Madison fiasco " Gradma's Boy " , the WHOLE thing . No , do not weep for me as I'm already dead . These 90 minutes have ranked among my most painful ever . Whether it was the retarded sitcomish storyline of a game testing moving in with his grand mom and her ' wacky ' friends , the annoying geek who broke into robotic voice , the lame attempts at " humor " , the stereotypical nerds , or the hackneyed ' love ' development , it matters not . The fact is that my will to live is now gone . Thanks to all involved for making a festering unfunny abortion of a movie . If you loved " Eight Crazy Nights " , " Little Nicky " , or " Larry the Cable Guy's Health Inspector " , you'll love this film ( I strongly advise making you people sterile somehow , by the way ) . If you liked " the 40 Year old Virgin " , " the Wedding Crashers " or " Waiting . . . ) , however , congratulations YOU have good tastes and you should stay FAR away from this film .
520127	1162550	367222	1.0	This is about What Lies Beneath ? ? You'd think so , but you'd be wrong	This 15 minute featurette on the making of " What Lies Beneath " can be found on the special edition DVD of the aforementioned movie . If you think nothing in-depth could be said about an over 2 hour film in merely 15 minutes , you'd be right and this feels much more like a promo piece than anything else . Plus whenever you have " Perfect " ANYthing in the title , it reeks of being full of itself . I mean the film was good , but ' the perfect thriller ' ? ? ? Come on now , nowhere close . This goes more into Robert Zemeckis ' film career than anything else . With the film it was supposed to be based on seeming like an afterthought .
521083	1162550	451085	2.0	' special ' effects on par with " the Thing Below "	With so-called ' special ' effects that may very well rival " the Thing Below " , this tale of giant intelligent bugs that terrorize sorority girls is bad in every possible way . The acting's awful , the plot's overtly stupid , and the aforementioned special effects make the whole thing laughable , if not for the fact that you'll be too depressed that you've wasted about an hour and a half on this garbage . Even nudity can't save this from falling into the abyss of the dreaded DVD bargain bin . Not that bargain can be used in any connotation when referring to this movie . No matter which way you slice it , simply dreadful . Good thing that Director Jeffery Lando holds three citizenships , become this film ( and his others ) are so bad that his American should be revoked . Eye Candy : the unfortunately named Chris Guy shows everything she's got ; Rhonda Dent shows T & A ; Anna Farrant and Natalia Tudge just show tits
520314	1162550	100811	2.0	obvious lame jokes fall flat	Jim Wynorski directed some extremely watchable B-movies in the beginning of his career . Deathstalker 2 , Chopping Mall , Sorority House Massacre 2 , to name a few . While all cheesy , they were all fun . This film , however , is not among his bests by a long shot . ( it IS however writer R . J . Robertson's best , but compared to House 4 , Munchie strikes back , or Beastmaster 2 , that's not particularly a ringing endorsement ) Dexter accompanies Marisa to Transylvania in order to get to her uncle's funeral and subsequent viewing of the video will . She stands to inherit the family mansion , but sinister Byron , her other uncle ( played by Robert Vaughn , who must have needed money in a bad way ) . The jokes and so-called ' parodies ' are lame , obvious , extremely unoriginal , and more likely to produce a groan than anything even remotely resembling a laugh . If you're a maschocist rent this along with the equally atrocious Transylvania 6-5000 for the completely laughing double feature from hell .
519646	1162550	252028	2.0	Watch this on a double-bill with " Christmas with the Kranks " if you're a COMPLETE masochist	Drew Latham ( Ben Affleck , who desperately needs another movie thats actually watchable ) is a brass wealthy young man who desperate to find someone to spend Christmas with decides to pay the family that now live in his boyhood home $250 thousand dollars ( initially ) to spend the holidays with them in order to recapture some of his childhood memories . Affleck's narcissistic A-hole character didn't walk for me in the least , and really he himself isn't that good of an actor anyway ( barring Good Wil Hunting ) . And as horrid as Affleck is in this film , Christina Applegate is quite possibly a million times worse as the hateful daughter who ' warms up ' to Drew . Unsurprisingly James Gandolfini as the father is pretty much the only person who makes it out of this train wreck of a film intact . He almost makes the film watchable ( ok , that may be overstating the fact a tad ) . How poor Udo Keir got roped into this travesty , is anyone's clue . I hesitate to blame Director Mike Mitchell as I enjoyed some of his past work . But look at the writers ' other credits . Yup , it's easy laying the blame of this crap squarely on their respective doorsteps . Where I saw it : HBO

He's soon awash with dealings with strippers , nuclear scientists , CIA operatives , and large-toothed mobsters ( among others ) . The acting all around is atrocious , the plot , for lack of a better term , is a mess , the " hero " throughly unconvincing by any stretch of the imagination , and Janet Wood is the extremely unwanted love smitten girl who hangs on to Dave , all are rancid ingredients that torpedo this movie to the lower regions of cinema where all the other unwatchable turds dwell . Oh and if one were to edit out all the padding that the movie has it would be half an hour shorter at the least . Eye Candy : Janet Wood shows her breasts ; Angelique Pettyjohn provides the T & A ; and Victoria Racimo shows everything

Imagine " The Hills have Eyes " and " Texas Chainsaw Massacre " . Now imagine if those films had no wit , no finesse , and were deathly boring . OK now you have a good idea what to expect if you're forced to endure this crappy little film . Easily one of the worst of the second crop of " 8 films to die for " that I've seen thus far ( I've seen 4 of them including this ) Eye Candy : Malea Richardson provides the T &
521177	1162550	79300	2.0	so bad , SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO bad	A photographer strangles homely models after he photographs them he then meets a ugly girl who strangles bums . Really not much more of a plot and aside from some narration added in post production . This is a stupid stupid film and if I hadn't already watched " Schizophreniac : The Whore Mangler " , I would have thought it the worst serial killer film I had ever seen . But I DID see the aforementioned film so this one while still horrid , doesn't seem bad in comparison . The ONLY way to watch this travesty would be with the Joe Bob Briggs commentary on or not at all . DVD Extras : Movie Intro & Commentary by Joe Bob Briggs ; Second commentary by Ray Steckler ; Interviews with Steckler & Caroline Brandt ; Production stills & poster art ; and trailers for " Blood Shack " , " Adventure of Rat Pfink and boo boo " , " Slaughter Hotel " , and " Nightmare come at Night " Eye Candy : Joanne Hiatt , Lori Morrir , Snowy Sinclair , Bonnie Smith , and Jean Robert all get topless

Of course the wife acts like a pre-teen girl & starts a fight with a psycho hacker who wants to kill them . It's up to Huey Lewis of Huey Lewis fame to save her before it's too late . When one watches a Nico Mastorakis film one doesn't expect a logical story or likable characters or any semblance of a good movie . Those that watch Mastorakis's films are pretty much sexists who like to test their endurance of crap . This film is no different in that respect . Where i saw it : Showtime on demand
521295	1162550	105507	2.0	Rancid Injustice	Sunny ( Finn Carter ) gathers her kick boxing girlfriends and a cop ( Marc ' the Beastmaster ' Colton ) to get revenge after her sister is killed by a toxic waste dumping creep by the name of Billy Joe ( the late Frank Gorshin known always as The Riddler from the old Batman show ) . We know he's ' evil ' from the get go because he smokes ( the horror , the horror ) . OK so technically she's killed by a dog , but if the movie was about a gang of women using martial arts against canines , the movie would probably be slightly sillier ( but probably marginally better ) So anyways , obviously all the pretty girls can kick any man's ass from here to there and they do in their quest to bring Billy Joe down . So I guess one could classify this as a feminist eco-friendly action flick with one gratuitous hot tub scene . You know the kind Steven Seagal would be making if he was still a valuable commodity . The first half of this film is deathly dull as nothing happen and the film moves at a snail's pace , so much so that when the ' action ' starts , even the most hardened B-movie veteran will be lulled to a near comatose state . This is one step above " Chickboxer " Eye Candy : Finn Carter , Kathleen Kinmont , and Cheryl Paris get topless Where i saw it : TM
519503	1162550	461273	2.0	worthless promo piece	I like Making of featurettes mainly when they're made in hind sight and in retrospective , and when I see one that's made and released before the film even comes out it just reeks of less of a Making of and more like a standard cut and paste promotional spot . Such is the case with this one that originally aired on the Cinemax network a week or so before the film was released theatrically . And as such these 13 minutes are pretty much worthless if you've already seen the movie itself and since it's found o the DVD release of it there's a rather good chance that you have . So skip this and do something better .
521374	1162550	114448	2.0	Kills via incompetence	The level of acting in the film about an ex-cop in the wilderness who only looks to kill the murderers of his family when the happen to stumble over him is atrocious . The action stunted . And the plot clichéd to no end . Fred Williamson is a cool actor , but as a director he just doesn't cut it . Avoid at all costs , the film is dreadful . This is my second time reviewing this as IMDb deletes stuff willy nilly now . Eye Candy : Lynneadams has a quick flash , and Annie Dufresne shows that fine Canadian bod of hers Where i saw it : Starz Mystery
519783	1162550	455960	2.0	I'd rather stick out my middle finger , than my thumb	The original Hitcher film was a nice little understated horror flick . There is nothing understated about this brain dead remake , Sean Bean ( usually a very capable actor ) has his talents wasted as John Ryder ( a role that Rutger Hauer made his own in the original ) . The two protagonists are so borderline mentally retarded that it's very hard to root for either of them to escape the absurd perils that the hitcher puts them in , and the plot is utterly awful . Racking my brain to find something ANYthing at all to say positive about this waste of money , I can only tell you that it's still better then the Jake Busey-helmed crap-fest that was " Hitcher 2 " My grade :

But three murderous convicts are there killing the owner of said farmhouse and his family . One of them accidentally brings zombies around by knocking over a scarecrow . Cue blood , gore , carnage , bad acting . Better than the first but only by default . I still wouldn't wish it on my arch-enemy , bob . In the end the filmmaker wants it to be a parable about how we us Americans are killing ourself and our forests ( huh ? OK , whatever buddy ) Dude I'd rather chop down forests then have my braincells diminish and my Grey matter leak out of my ears . In other words become a simple-minded idiot Liberal .
521446	1162550	248974	2.0	Stupid decisions made by stupid people	Ronnie ( Adam Scott , who'd later go on to parts in Step Brothers & the Matador ) is a sad sack loser of a guy who works at a halfway house for the mentally disabled . He grows infatuated by Sara , one of the residents when he spies her naked n the bathroom . So much is his fondness that later when he sees her standing in the middle of the street ( she had wondered out of the house ) he decides to take her back to his mom's place ( where he lives , mom's in the hospital after falling out of a taxi ) for some nookie . Things get complicated when Ronnie's druggie brother , fresh out of prison , shows up a day early and decides to party with his equally pathetic friends . Meanwhile the other helper at the Halfway house is looking for Sara . The movie started out with an intriguing premise , but soon devolved into something else entirely . Everyone in the film acts insanely stupid and none of their actions make much sense even under the lightest of scrutiny . By the end ( which was such a WTF moment that I ceased to exist caring ) I was though even trying to care what the hell was going on . The film felt more like a series of random story ideas thrown out there and less like a coherent plot . I'm positive there's a good story to be told of a mentally handicapped person who's kidnapped by a social worker for nefarious sexual purposes , but this movie just isn't it .

However the resulting hybrid has a taste for . . . . . blood and sex ! ! Leaving the bum to go look for his lost loving vacuum , Dusty Thisultra-low budget curiosity is definitely a weird one , you'll never see a rapist vacuum cleaner in any other movie and the ridiculous image stays with you for a little while . The whole film feels like it was written on a bunch of cocktail napkins . Plot-lines and story elements disappear & reappear haphazardly and the movie goes off on a few tangents . Furthermore , the film feels too long for it's thin premise . Michael Paul Girard was able to make a minor soft-core skin classic with his later " Babes 2 : Lost in Beaver Creek " , but this , his first film , only showed that he had a lot of unpolished edges that he needed to smooth out before getting to that point .

But this angers the biggest snake whom they don't know of . After the police leave the big snake slithers out of the sewers and transforms into the very naked " sex Medusa " ( Nomoto Miho , most known for her role in " Fudoh : The New Generation " ) . She's taken in by a sweet and rich , but impotent stranger . There's also a duo of scientists in a side-plot that goes nowhere . This film is not that good in the least and I found myself yawning and looking at my watch quite frequently . You think that the sex Medusa would be really peeved that her ' family ' was killed , but she's more passive then most of the characters in the movie , nothing much happens , and the special effects so to speak are absurd . True Miho is topless a lot in the film ( and bares her ass too ) , but since you can see that in much better film's that she's been in , it's hardly enough reason to see this boringly bad film .

" Blood Syrup " is about a guy who is weirded out by his syrup that he thinks is alive . That basically it . Oh and the Director and actors are all connected to G4 TV in some way , which should tell you something . Because no matter HOW noble a channel dedicated to video games may seem to you , if you ever tried watching any of the crap on G4 , you know the execution makes it simply unwatchable . Such is the case with this short actually . Did you like how I tied that all together and somehow managed to get the mandatory ten line requirement that IMDb has made mandatory ? Yea I do too : )

MST3K mocked this short unmercifully of course and it was among the funniest ribbing of a short I've seen from the show . Bought a big smile too my face .

This is one of the episodes that can be found on Volume 1 of the US release of the Hitchhiker , and by choosing the episodes by star power as opposed to the actual best episodes of the series , it really doesn't do it justice . This is proved once again in this episode which is mediocre at best and has an abrupt ending that is completely unfuffiling and made me not like the episode even more .

Bad ass phychopath , Shadow ( Candyman's Tony Todd ) is executed , but not before starting a full scale riot resulting in many prisoner deaths . Twenty years later the prison is now a womens ' penitentiary . Focusing on the new inmate , Solitaire ( Carla Greene ) , a tough girl who Shadow was planning to sacrifice when she was a baby , it isn't long before the zombies of the prisoners led by Shadow himself are out to finish what he started . This cheesy b-grade horror flick might have had a little promise in the beginning and I like Tony Todd , but once the film gets to the women's prison and focuses on it's inhabitants , the film becomes simply dreadfully lame , not even the shower scene or other nudity could save it from sub-par mediocrity . The film does pick up in the last 30 minutes or so , but not enough to make it watchable . my grade : D Eye Candy : Toy , and Aggie Valdez show tits ; Misty Mundae gives full frontal ; Danielle Riley shows EVERYthing ; and various extras show much skin as well

Due to an over-reliance on ominous ' point-of-view ' shots that all but give away the killer , comic panel seuqueways that make the movie seem silly and trite ( well MORE silly and trite than the film already is anyway ) , acting that's slightly sub-par , and a fairly generic story , this movie comes off as just another tedious entry in the sea of countless PG-13 rated ( the movie is Not rated , but it's definitely only PG-13 caliber ) so-called " horror " flicks . Rent the one with Joe Estevez instead . DVD Extras : Commentary by Writer / director Sean Beyer & actors Pamela Noble , Lauren Storm , Kristin Herrera , Kevin G . Schmidt , and Kyle Davis ; a 13 minute Making-of ; 12 minutes of bloopers ; 3 deleted scenes ; theatrical trailer for this film
519849	1162550	91752	3.0	go watch Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers or Wizards of the Demon Sword instead	Sadly even the combined great talents of Jeffrey Combs , Michelle Bauer , Sybil Dannng , and yes , even Robby the Robot cant save this boring little film about a small group of people finding a ' lost world ' in a cave while searching for diamonds . It kills me because I love the films Fred Olen Ray did in the ' 80's . For the most part they were just low-budget cheesy goodness that put a smile upon my face . ( Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers is SOOO good ) . But this film just didn't do anything for me & even though he'd make a last gasp with the enjoyable " Scream Queen Hot Tub Party " and extremely fun " Wizards of the Demon Sword " , the decades after wouldn't be nearly as kind to him movie-writing wise . Retro-media DVD Extras : Commentary by Fred Olen Ray & Gary Graver ; Nite Owl Theater ( basically just an intro by Fred ) ; 24 minute documentary ; 10 minutes of behind the scenes footage ; 3 minutes of alternate takes for TV ; Stills gallery ; & unused artwork Eye Candy : Michelle Bauer & Tricia Burns both get topless while catfighting ( There's also 3 topless girls in the Nite Owl Theater special feature )
520218	1162550	439569	3.0	so bad that I can't even think of a snappy summary	Twisted Sisters is about a set of twins ( both played by Fiona Horsey ) , one a pregnant , happily engaged successful business-woman , the other a man-hating castrating she-bitch who would get Gloria Steinem's seal of approval . It's also about an hour and a half too long . Crammed with barely adequate acting , very derivative storyline , and not particularly grisly deaths , this is one that can be skipped and you won't anything at all . It's been done , and done much better in " Sisters " Only recommended for true dyed in the wool fans of Director Wolfgang Büld , all two of you .
520754	1162550	906734	3.0	goes nowhere and takes it's damn time getting there	Gina McVey ( Lena Headly from the Sarah Connor Chronicles ) sees her mirror image one day after a mirror breaks during a dinner being held for friends . Curiosity causes her to follow this ' other self ' which leads to a downward spiral of madness and despair in Sean Ellis's contribution to ( the increasingly misnamed ) ' 8 Films to Die For ' festival . One thing that struck me right off the bat was the surprising lack of nudity for much of the film ( yes there's a little bit in the second half of the film ) which is simply notable for the mere reason that Ellis's " Cashback " ( a superior film in every way compared to this one , by the way ) had tons of it and the actresses in this one take multiple baths & showers usually with no nudity on display . As a matter of fact if one got rid of the scenes of baths / showers & a certain car accident that we see play out over and over again , the film would've been maybe 45 minutes long . The other thing that I realized as the minutes drug slowly past is that this film was deathly drawn out . I can appreciate a slow-burning movie if it were tense & drew me in . This film did neither & only made me wish that I was watching Drew Barrymore's similarly themed " Doppleganger " instead . ( and trust me , I'm no big fan of that one either ) . This was the first of the third batch ' 8 Films to Die For " that I watched . Needless to say , it wasn't off to a good start . Eye Candy : Michelle Duncan & Lena Headly each show tits and ass ; while Elle Crocker body doubles for Michelle during a full frontal shot Lionsgate DVD Extras : Miss Horrorfest Web-isodes ( running 58 lame minutes in total ) ; a combo trailer for the 8 films to die for 3 ; and trailers for " A Haunting in Connecticut " , " Crank 2 " , " Punisher : War Zone " , " the Transporter 3 " , " Weapons " , " Midnight Meat Train " , & " Saw 5 "
521248	1162550	381600	3.0	boring	A little less fluffy as the other putrid masturbatory extra related to this film , " My Buddy , Jack " , but not very much so . It's funny when the director boasts about how many cameos he got in the film of famous people . You know what who cares ? If he concentrated less on getting cameos and more on , say , making the movie , I don't know . . . FUNNY , then he might have had a good ( or at least passable ) film on his hands . But I guess that was way more to ask for from the Director of " Nutty Professor 2 " and the Writer of " My Boss's Daughter " . This 18 minute featurette can be located on the region 1 special edition DVD of the movie " Anger Management " My grade :
521347	1162550	64415	3.0	the Hell's Angel's deserve much better	Tom Stern and Jeremy Slate are swing bachelor's planning to hijack a casino , ala " Ocean's 11 " , and pin it on the Hell's Angels . Bad move . For a film with the words Hell's Angels AND the number 69 AND featuring actual Hell's Angels , this movie is surprisingly tame . The Hell's Angels truly deserve a better film to be centered around them . Not this snoorefest . Luckily this is one of the DVDs that features commentary by Joe Bob Briggs so the pain of having to sit through it is greatly alleviated . If you watch it any other way , let me recommend something to you . DON'T ! ! DVD Extras : Joe Bob Brigg's commentary ; Conny Van Dyke's message to her fans ( she has more than one ? ) ; Photo gallery ; Theatrical Trailer ; and Trailers for " Blood Shack " , " Hell High " , " Samurai Cop " , and " The Hollywood Strangler "
521244	1162550	339531	3.0	Bigfoot can always be counted on for a Big snooze	A group of forest rangers and scientists go into the woods to find fossils . They stumble on a Bigfoot burial ground eventually ( the didn't notice it in the dark ) , The scenes of the CGI Bigfoot are horrid , but better than the endless scenes of talking that they rarely punctuate . I used to think that there just might be a good Bigfoot movie to be made . But now after so many sad sad movies about the legend , I'm having serious doubts . To pour salt in the wound of watching this film , the ONE good-looking girl just doesn't get naked once . And while this one MAY be better than " Boggy Creek 2 " ( no mean feat there ) , it's still sad that the best non-documentary film on Bigfoot remains " Harry and the Henriksons "
520391	1162550	304166	3.0	this movie is BAAAAAAAd	Reverand Salo Jr . invites five teenage druggies who escape from rehab to come to his secluded house on a promise of salvation . Salo Jr . and his wife's daughter , Grace , is very unhappy , but keeps getting dreams and visions of her grand-father , Salo Sr . ( Kreskin , whom I refuse to call him ' Amazing ' ) . Some of the teens have adverse effects to the drug that Salo Jr . had given them prior to them breaking out of rehab . Both the plot lines will entangle before long . OK , about this film . Weird & obtuse does NOT automatically equate to scariness and Kreskin is not a good actor bring the whole movie down . Is it a bad film ? That's debatable . Is it a good horror movie ? hell no it isn't .

But when she develops a conscience for no reason whatsoever , choosing to go home and masturbate with her gun rather than kill her mark , her clergy bosses ( Yup they're involved in this too , the bad clergy is pretty much a groan-worthy movie cliché now ) are none too happy and mark her for death . This flick was somewhat of a chore to sit through and really doesn't make much sense if you think about it . Pure mindless drivel .

519993	1162550	1031254	3.0	lacks the fangs of the original	Newly transplanted to California , siblings Chris and Nicole soon find themselves up to the necks in vampires ( headed by Angus Sutherland , Kiefer's half-brother ) Chris must deal with the tribe of bloodsuckers ( with the help of one half of the Frog brothers duo , namely Edgar , Corey Feldman reprising his role from the first film ) after his sister's been bitten but not fully turned yet . Well this sequel wasn't outright horrid , it still felt like a supremely unneeded retread of the first film which is this one superior in every conceivable way . The original Lost Boys was an 1980's classic , whereas this film with it's lame duck plot , sub-par acting , and lack of chills or tension will be lucky to be a one sentence footnote of the 2000's . The last scene after the credits , on the other hand , is just painfully awful Eye Candy : Moneca Delain provides the T & ADVD Extras : 2 featurettes ( Action junkies & Edgar Frog's Guide to Coming Back ) ; 2 alternate endings ; & 4 music videos
519958	1162550	87903	4.0	well the first half was enjoyable . . . . .	80's metal band Whitesnake's sultry siren Tawny Kitaen is extremely lucky in some ways ( ie . she dated OJ Simpson and lived to tell the tale ) . but decidedly unlucky in deciding this as her first feature film . Kitaen plays the titular role of Gwendoline who , with some help , is trying to find her father and a rare butterfly . While the first half of this film is so bad , it's good in a campy culty way , humorously enough the second half , when they actually find the girl tribe of the Yik Yak is when it takes a nosedive and becomes tedious . You'd think it would only get better by injecting a truckload of topless women , but you'd be wrong . As it's definitely not . But as I said up to around that point the movie is pretty damn enjoyable . And as bad as the second part of this film got ( and trust me it gets pretty awful ) . I'd STILL watch it a million times more than that " Avacado Women in the Jungle of Death " crap fest . Tawny's next film , Bachelor Party , however , was and still is a bonifide classic no matter how you slice it ( not really because of her , mind you ) DVD Extras : Commentary by Director Just Jaeckin ; Interview with Jaeckin ; Audio interview with comic creator John Willie ; Tawny Kitean photo-spread for Lui Magazine ; and both US & international theatrical trailers
520276	1162550	100827	4.0	If this film was a man who had one evil eye and one lazy googly eye , I'd still laugh at him	Dario Argento and George Romero team up , each telling a tale supposedly based on works of Edgar Poe . Romero's segment further solifies my notion that you can classify whatever George makes into two distinct parts : His Dead trilogy which is great and Everything else which turns out lacking . Blasphemy you say ? Well bullocks to you , if you can prove me wrong please do so . Anyway , in this first segment that plays out like a longer boring version of ' Tales From the Crypt " , Jessica Valdemar ( Adrienne Barbeau , of " Swamp Thing " and " Escape From New York " fame , and NO I will NOT even mention " Maude " it was a horrid horrid show ) wants to off her dying sugar daddy with the help of her hypnotizing Docter lover only to have the old coot come back . Even the almost good last few minutes of it can't save it . Luckily Dario Argento's segment while not without it's flaws ( such as a story thats WAY strecthed out ) , can't help but seem better . In that one Harvey Keitel beats the sh # out of an angry cat and the feline's owner . But it's a bit more then that . ( the high Argento grade cancels out the low Romero grade ) Blue Underground DVD extras : Disc 1 : talent bios ; Theatrical trailer ; and a poster / stills gallery Disk 2 : ' Two Master's Eyes ' documentary ; ' Savini's EFX ' ; " At home with Tom Savini " ; and a five minute interview with Adrienne BarbeauDVD Easter Egg : On disk 2 press up until " Extras " is highlighted to get an interview with George Romero's wife about her bit part as the nurse in his segment
520192	1162550	1020935	4.0	Dull commercial for suppliers of Atomic energy	Located on the DVD release of " Schlock ! The Secret History of American Movies " this 10 minute short that was made in the ' 60's hawks atomic power like it was going out of style ( well I guess it kinda did ) . Leslie Franzos is the star of the short as she dances around modeling as veteran character actor William Prince narrates his heart out to sell everything atomic . It's extremely dry , but it's an advertisement so it's to be expected . I found it boring though and can't see myself watching it again . Atomic power IS making a comeback pretty soon in the 21st century though , by the way .
519743	1162550	452594	4.0	proof that a film doesn't have to be romantic to be a chick flick	Gary ( Vince Vaughn ) and Brooke ( Jennifer Aniston ) have a typical relationship argument which spirals out of control causing the Break-up the title refers to . This film might have been on to something if the leads had that special chemistry . Vaughn and Anniston quite obviously do not . How can the viewer relate to this scenario on a emotional level , if one can't believe they were in love in the first place . As a consequence the crux of the film just all falls apart . There are some laughs to be hard at the start of the film , but this is more an uncharismatic chick-flick drama more than anything else . While the film is reasonably acted , and competently directed , there's no clear reason to see this film ( Jennifer Anistons exposed rear not withstanding )
521206	1162550	74875	4.0	Massacre of acting abilities	David , the new kid in school , prefers not to join the club that the only new friend he made , Mark , runs in . Craig , the leader of said gang doesn't like that David isn't falling in line and when he saves some " bull dykes " from getting raped by the gang , he pays for his insolence . Now after a stint in the hospital , he plots revenge . Horrid acting hamper this ' message ' horror movie . Homoerotic sub-text , lame killings , and bad dialog don't help either . And don't get me started on that theme song . Go rent " Class of 1984 " instead . Eye Candy : Kimberly Beck & Cheyrl Smith show all ; Lani O'Grady shows breasts
519638	1162550	214529	4.0	the lesser of all Belphégors	After putting a mummy in a local museum goes through the cat-scan , a metal object in it's brain reacts adversely to the procedure , thus freeing the spirit , or phantom if you will , of the mummy , Belphegor . Due to convenient circumstances , Lisa , who lives close to the museum finds herself possessed by the evil spirit . Soon enough she's stealing the museum's Egyptian treasures out from under their nose . Detective Verlac comes out of retirement to catch the supernatural thief . This is a serviceable enough , if you haven't seen any other incarnations of " Belphégor " before . If you have , I recommend skipping this particular version as it can't help but pale in comparison to the others despite the nice locals and scenery . It plays out like a ( slightly ) higher budgeted Sci-Fi Original film , and I don't really mean that as a compliment . Eye Candy : Sophie Marceau shows ass & side boob DVD Extras : none
521043	1162550	347079	4.0	it is what it is	Drunk and adventurous young woman ( in some kisses too young , a 17 year old got this title discontinued and now out of print ) flash the video camera tits , ass , and bush at Spring Break in Panama Cite beach Florida . Some are hesitant to do it for one set of beads , no problem though as TWO sets of beads are quite enough for these greedy , greedy people . I do applaud the makers letting the not so hot girls in as well ( even if there had no choice and had to pad the running time some how ) The DVD came with both Volumes 1 and 2 . I liked volume 2 better as it's set in Mardi Gras and I liked seeing places that I know in the background ( Ie . I've been there , hey look The Dungoen " . It's not really a fair representation of Mardi Gras tho , as most of the people on camera are white and in real life they do A lot more for beads , I could tell you some stories there . Also there are a lot my bead teases ( girls who pretend they're gonna flash and don't ) those assholes . I'm gonna rate this middle of the road . You get what you expect . It is what it is .
520448	1162550	289103	4.0	Disconnected	Gerald Thornhill leads a dreary existence , being middle aged and still living with his mother . When he keeps getting mysterious phone calls on his way to and from work , he stumbles on a way to free himself in this 8 minute black and white short from the UK . Not to be confused with the Malcolm McDowell thriller from 1987 . I couldn't really relate to the main character as he seemed too passively malicious . Technically the short was OK , it just left too many questions unanswered . Not that I like everything spelled it , as that's not the case at all . It's just Gerald's mom didn't seem overbearing in the least . My Short
521328	1162550	44154	4.0	there's only so much Sylvester can do to keep this boat from sinking	Sylvester the cat stowaway upon a ship that Tweety bird happens to be on with his owner Granny . Oh I don't even have enough words to convey how much I disdain both the Tweety and Granny characters . They simply are not funny to me and made this short quite the chore to sit through indeed . Sylvester is a great character on his own , but there's only so much he can do when confronted by the sheer awfulness of that accursed bid and senile old witch of a Granny . This animated short can be found on disc 4 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 1 and features an optional commentary by Micheal Barrier .
520319	1162550	444705	4.0	Same old song and dance my friend	Phil Varone's story about finding musical ( if not financial ) success as the drummer for Saigon Kick and his subsequent battles with drug addiction is truly nothing that you haven't heard before with a million different variations of a million different rock stars , but if you were / are a fan of the band than it's still somewhat interesting to watch once . With nothing truly worthy enough to sink your teeth into , I feel comfortable enough to deem this only worthy of a rent if you have nothing better in you netflix que . It comes off as one of the lesser E True Hollywood story-type deal ( but with ample profanity and a dash of slutty groupie boobs ) . The problem is that not one person in the documentary comes off as particularly charismatic or engaging for that matter . Region 1 DVD Extras : Alternative opening sequence ; Extended EPK ; studio drum session ; ' just hold on ' session ; unedited backstage footage ; Drug zone ; and a candid interview ( the extras all together clock in at an hour and 12 minutes )
519802	1162550	1111833	4.0	for fans of Doug's comedy only	For fans of Doug Benson's comedy , be it stand-up or " Best Week Ever " , you'll get more out of this documentary on him as he goes 30 days with weed and 30 days without then other viewers . If one goes into the film expecting an intelligent documentary on the pros Vs . cons of weed you'll be vastly disappointed . One only needs to know that this was made ' in cahoots ' ( the film's words not mine ) with 420 Partners Llc to know which side of the fence this film firmly sits on and thus skews the ' infomation ' in that direction and to suit it's need . Propaganda in a way , not to say it's not ( vaquely ) entertaining in bits and pieces , it is . Just go into the film knowing that it's slanted and you'll be fine .
520829	1162550	297181	4.0	I spy a terrible movie	In this dire remake of the mid to late 1960's Television series of the same name , Eddie Murphy takes over for Bill Cosby and Owen Wilson stands in for Robert Culp . In the version Kelly Robinson is an arrogant cocky boxer who is teamed up with less then stellar secret agent Alex Scott on a secret mission to recover a high tech stealth fighter plane . Unimaginative , unfunny , and VERY generic doesn't help this movie any . Eddie Murphy should just quit making movies while's he's far behind . Give his more talented brother , Charles some roles instead . He sinks Owen down . The 4 screenwriters ( yup it took 4 to come up with this crap ) sadly are not done with sub-par terrible re-makes . Nope not by a long shot , Cormac and Marianne Wibberley are making re-makes of " The Shaggy Dog " AND " I Dream of Jeanie " , while Jay Scherick and David Ronn are going to be held responsible for an all - black version of the Rodney Dangerfield classic " Back to School " . All 4 are a great examples of why Hollywood is a barren cesspool of unoriginal crap . DVD Extras : Both Widescreen & Fullscreen versions ; Commentary by director Betty Thomas , editor Peter Teschner , producer Jenno Topping , and writers David Ronn & Jay Scherick ; 4 featurettes ( Cloak and Camouflage , Gadgets and Gizmos , Schematics and Blueprints , and The Slugfest ; and Trailers for " Adaptation " , " Blue Streak " , " Formula 51 " , " National Security " , and " Punch Drunk Love " 1 Easter Egg : Highlight the motorcycle head light in the Extras menu for an interview with Eddie Murphy about boxing
520010	1162550	405134	5.0	average	The Chiodo Brothers talk about the making of this b-movie classic . Including the original opening , how they first came up with the idea , other deleted scenes , why they were deleted , how they made the Klown's explode , the Cocoon gun , the and balloon gag They also talk about their influences and why they love making monster movies , as well as show how the dog wouldn't follow directions . I would have liked to hear more about the actors and what they would like to do in a sequel though . This 21 minute featurette can be found on MGM's ' Midnight Movies ' Special Edition DVD of " Killer Klowns from Outer Space " .
521243	1162550	87981	5.0	For the most part not a bore	The future director of " Highlander " and the screen-writer of the great HBO staple back in the day " Fortress " team up to tell this Austrailian horror tale that has a giant boar killing a farm owner's grandson . At first no one believes his tale about the huge Razorback , but he eventually gets acquitted on insignificant evidence . After the same Razorback kills a guy's Jounarlist wife after she's run off the road by local owners of the slaughterhouse she was investigating , he along with a graduate scientist researching the boars and the previously mentioned grandfather go hunting . I could have done without the dream sequences and it seems to lose coherence towards the end , but all in all it was simply alright as far as " nature run amok " films go . Though I preferred the previous year's " Of Unknown Origin " more .
521423	1162550	248110	5.0	Book of Revelations	Six friends ( and a dog ) each harboring a deep dark secret ( minus the dog , of course ) are invited to an old friend , Roland's ( Lance Henriksen ) , secluded island retreat . Where they are promptly poisoned via wine at dinner . Seems Roland had experienced a near-death life-changing experience when he unknowingly drank poison while traveling abroad , and he wishes to share this ' gift ' with the others in order to free them of their inner demons . But as one by one they start dropping dead , is his reasoning truly sound ? Henrikson is a magnificent actor who has been in some dreadful films ( Pumpkinhead 3 , the Mangler , etcetera ) but with even a mediocre script , he can and does take the ball and run with it . Here he pulls off a pretty good performance , sadly however the rest of the cast can't hope to excel and pale in comparison . The movie itself is good enough until it devolves before your eyes into something akin to a Made-For-Lifetime TV movie . ( you'll understand after watching it ) But it still kept my interest for the most part , thanks in no small part to Lance .
520457	1162550	160184	5.0	Sadly Eye see this movie	From the Director of such " greats " as I Know what you did last Summer & Joyride , comes another failed Stallone come-back attempt . In this one Rocky himself is taken to a Detox clinic after he hits the bottle when his fiancé gets killed . But it seems the killer is there too . Naturly it's up to Stallone to save the day . If I could sum up this movie in one word , it would be ' uninvolving ' . If I had two words to describe the film it would have to be ' muddled mess ' But however I choose to describe it , the outcome is the same . Save your money , save your time . I knew who the killer was in record time , but it would've been better if Charles Dutton was the murderer , you know . . art imitating life and what not .

520286	1162550	64789	5.0	MAYBE Franco's best ( not saying much , tho )	Jimmy Logan ( James Darren of " Gidget " and TJ Hooker fame ) digs his horn back up ( which is deeply symbolic , trust me ) , then spots a dead woman . He seems to vaguely remember her and flashes back to when he first saw Wanda Reed . He jets to Rio in order to forget about how Wanda was raped and killed , only to find her inexplicably in Rio . The ending is no big surprise as Franco throws hint after hint at the viewer . " The Sixth Sense " this is NOT . However , this is Franco's most accessible and coherent film , while still maintaining the dream-like quality that can be found , albeit in varying degrees , in much of his other work . And while I hesitate to say this is Jess Franco's best film , it IS up there . All the actors give good performances and the film keeps you interested . Plus you get to see Manfred Mann in an ultra-rare movie cameo . But I NEVER want to hear that damn repetitive theme song ever again . DVD Extras : Interview with Jess Franco ; Audio interview with Maria Rohm ; poster and Still galleries ; and Theatrical Trailer Eye Candy : Maria Rohm gets topless on several occasions ; Margaret Lee shows her bum ; and various extras get topless
520782	1162550	82452	5.0	not the classic as it seems	Director Henri Pachard ( " Blame it on Ginger " , " Devil in Miss Jones 2 " ) and Writer Joel Bender ( of unsung B-movie urban warfare classic " Tenement " ) team up for this triple X rated film featuring Juliet Anderson and the legendary Ron Jeremy as con artists after a ultra-valuable diamond owned by a wealthy man , all coming to a head at an annual masquerade party . . An over reliance on crappy disco music almost sinks this one , yet the story is able to carry it . Even so this is far from a classic that the current rating that it's at suggests . The last scene IS pretty hot though , i'll give it that .
519650	1162550	321442	6.0	a quirky little enjoyable film	John ( Jon Favreau ) , a failing out of work actor , hesitantly agrees to transport a mysterious blue suitcase , contents unknown , into the remote desert and deliver it to a mysterious person only known as Cowboy in order to wipe his tremendous debt that he's in . By taking the job he doesn't realize that he's in far the weirdest events n his life ( including but not limited to , a femme fatale , her crazy jealous boyfriend , Kelsey Grammar as a FBI guy investigating a beheading , and more ) in this quirky little subtle comedy that's reminiscent of David Lynch's " Twin Peaks " with a bit of " X-files " thrown in , but not as dark as the former , nor as complex and involved as the latter . Any film that Jon Favreau seems to star in I enjoy ( well except for a small handful that I actively detest , but none because of him ) and while this film is not as great as his other dark comedies that he's starred in ( Very Bad Things and Made ) , it's still perfectly serviceable , with fine performances and is a pretty good first time effort by Director Steve Anderson . Even if it loses some steam towards the end ( and I still can't divorce Kelsey Grammar with his " Frasier " character , no matter how hard I try )

Paul Bartel's second attempt at the race movie , while good isn't as fun as his previous " Death Race 2000 " .

519947	1162550	359012	6.0	Average featurette	Starting off as a brief history of horror and slasher films , various people take about Hammer films , Herschell Gordon Lewis , and various other notable horror films . Moving onto the original " Final Destination " , and the particapents go on to the less interesting part 2 . Seeind and hearing of those better horror films of past years , one can't help but see Final Destination 2 as being as unworthy as it truly is . However this documentary features all the ' good bits ' and how they accomplished the gore of the ' good bits ' It winds up being an OK documentary . This 30 minute 30 second featurette can be located on New Line's Infinifilm DVD release of " Final Destination 2 "
520995	1162550	82242	6.0	Slightly above average	A photographer is walking down the beach on the edge of Potter's Bluff , he sees a beautiful girl willing and eager to be photographed . He seems to be smitten with her , until some local town folk tie him up and burn him alive . When the same mentioned guy turns up in Potter's Bluff proper , none the worse for wear , it doesn't sit well with local Sheriff Gillis ( James Farentino ) . As for starts examining other grisly murders , he can't help but feel they're connected somehow , even if he doesn't quite fanthom the extant . This is a rather moody thriller hampered by some ineffective gore scenes ( some of them are effective , though ) , some big loopholes , and an unsatisfying ending . But all in all I liked the film . The musical score is effective in setting the mood . Nominated for a Saturn Award for best movie in 1982 , but the honor went rightfully to " An American Werewolf in London " ( How the Awful " Wolfen " even got nominated that same year , I haven't a clue ) ( My Limited Edition # is 32560 , in case anyone gives a hoot ) 2-Disk Blue Underground Limited Edition DVD Extras : Disk 1 ) Commentary with Gary A .

520500	1162550	988849	6.0	This dubious sex act ultimately cums undone	Three girlfriends decide to have one last hurrah before their vacation ends by joining 4 guys in a drug and sex-fueled cruise on their private yacht . All is just peaches until one of the ( too put it diplomatically ) more amorous girls get inadvertently killed by a donkey punch , the act of punching a girl in the back of the head when the man is about to climax ( the idea being that this act would cause the girl to involuntary spasm in her neither regions , thus providing the man with much more pleasure ) , after her neck snaps . Obviously the guys are more concerned with their respective futures than doing the right thing . What follows is a dangerous game destined to culminate into a brutal showdown . What we have here is more or less a horror-centric version of the darkly comedic " Very Bad Things " , but ultimately not as good as the aforementioned film . Although I did enjoy the film to an extent and found that it was able to hold some nice tension ( however fleeting ) But as time wore on my suspension of disbelief became increasingly too much to bear ( especially in the last few minutes which were just utterly ridiculous ) , and sadly it adversely affected my overall opinion of this movie .

520194	1162550	427470	7.0	Lookout for this film	Scott Frank as a writer is fairly generic and a tad derivative , but he's also pretty solid and when one goes into any of his films , he doesn't disappoint as they're usually tauntly told tales . This film starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt ( Third Rock from the Sun ) as Chriss Pratt a slightly mentally retarded janitor who got that way after being involved in a bad car accident , who's duped into being the lookout in a bank heist , is no exception . It's extremely watchable due to the high caliber of acting by Levitt and Jeff Daniels ass Lewis , his blind friend who was matched up with him by a social worker after the crash amongst others . One readily knows how the film will play out and there's nothing in the way of surprises . Yet the well-told , well-acted movie holds your interests throughout none the less . Eye Candy : Tinsel Korey has quite the stunning ass to behold Region 1 DVD Extras : Commentary by Scott Fran & Director of Photography Alar Kivilo ; 8 and a half minute ' behind the mind of Chriss Pratt ' featurette ; 20 minute featurette on Sequencing the Lookout ; and Trailers for " Becoming Jane " , " Eagle Vs .

521225	1162550	74174	7.0	Tanner rules	Aging hard-drinking has-been minor league baseball star Morris Buttermaker ( Walter Matthau ) is hired to coach a ragtag team of misfits known as the Bears in little league . Actually winning a game seems all in vain , until Buttermaker brings in two ringers , Amanda Whurlizer ( Tatum O'Neal ) and Kelly Leak ( Jackie Haley ) . This film is not the modern day classic that a lot of people seem to think it is , but it's enjoyable cute enough . The best part of the film is Chris Barnes as the foul-mouthed Tanner . This is one of the very few films that I have no gripes with being remade , and actually look forward to Richard Linklater's Billy Bob Thornton version ( provided the keep the more un-PC moments intact )
519795	1162550	110017	7.0	the second outing of Sorbo as Hercules is better than the first	This , the second of five TV movies that would lead up to the Hercules TV show , starts of with a giant coming to do battle with Hercules ( Kevin Serbo ) . Afterwards , Herc is beckoned to help the people of the lost city of Troy escape the clutches of Hera , the queen of the Gods in the form of a water creature this time . So accompanied by Deianeira , a girl he saved from sacrifice to the Gods , despite her wishes , he goes off on a new quest to find the fabled kingdom . Even though I missed Michael Hurst as Iolaus in this one , I enjoyed seeing Robert Trebor ( who would go onto the series later on ) as the comic relief as Waylin the Slave . All in all , I found this film to be better than the first outing , but it's still not as good as the eventual show would become . Also In my previous review of " Hercules and the Amazon Women " , I was extremely remiss in not mentioning the late Anthony Quinn as Zeus , well he's great in this as well as all the other Hercules telemovies .
521307	1162550	82495	7.0	very nice sequel	Picking up directly after Part 1 , Laurie Strode is now in a hospital from the wounds that Micheal Myers inflicted on her . But Myers isn't done with her yet and pursues her to the hospital continuing to kill anyone in his way . Mike is also being pursued by the just as devoted Sam Loomis . The first sequel to " Halloween " , while not as good as the first , nor in my mind the great forth film , is still very tense , thrilling and worth watching for any fan of slasher films . The only three " halloween " films that hold up to repeat viewing by , by the way , are the original ( naturally ) , this , and Part 4 ( the third had nothing to do with Myers at all , the less said of that film the better ) DVD Extras : Production Notes ; Cast & Crew Filmographies ; and Theatrical Trailer

He , his friend , and a bitchy activist decide to go to a freak show on a spur of the moment . But the owner has more evil plans in store , so he takes them out back and turns them into mutants who he'll add to his collection and make perform in his freak shows . It's up to him and the other freaks that he befriends to rise up . Once the psychedelic credit sequence started playing accompanied with a cool Henry Rollins tune , I knew I was onto something good , I just didn't know how great what followed would be . You'll KNOW if you're gonna love this film or hate it within the first 10 minutes . I reside firmly in the love it group . This film will never win an Oscar or any other " prestigise " award . It will never be on any critic's top ten list . But if you have an off-kilter sense of humor , you will , like I , adore this film . How can you go wrong with great roles by Mr . T as a bearded lady , Bobcat Goldthwait at the height of his career as a guy with a sock for a head , or Rastafarian eyeball ?

Shriek Show dropped the ball with this one somewhat . With the shorter American " Schizord " version getting a better transfer , while the original Italian version is relegated to the second disc . It doesn't look as good and is in full-screen . It's great to own this at all , but I was somewhat disheartened .

He's trying to reconstruct her face with those of other girls . The fashion model's father sends Sam Morgan , his war buddy and now a private investigator to find his daughter . One of Franco's best films , it has the benefit of being coherent and not unwatchable , putting it in the class of Jess Fronco films that only number less then a handful . The presentation is nice EXCEPT the last line of Telly Savalas is in French for no reason all .

The conversation itself is engaging and flows nicely , but the scenes out of the restaurant , though not without merit ( David Cross , Jack Black , and Maura Tierney , have good parts in said parts ) , tend to mess up the flow of the film somewhat . And based on the film I'd be interested in seeing the play .

The film is interesting if only to see how much porn advanced in some ways , but didn't at all in others . There's nothing to really get aroused to in here , but if you ever were interested in how it all got started , then this will have you fascinated to no end . ( well except for some of the filler )
520146	1162550	75917	7.0	Bobby alone makes this anthology film worth watching	This horror anthology film that was made for TV features three stories . The first , ' A Second Chance ' stars Ed Begley Jr . as a young man who finds that his newly purchased antique car can travel in time . It's an interesting little tale reminiscent of The Twilight Zone , but it doesn't really have any place in a supposed horror film ( even one that was made for TV . The middle tale , ' no such thing as a vampire ' , stars Patrick Macnee as Dr . Gheria , a wealthy British man whose wife believe that she's been the victim of a vampire . Gheria naturally doesn't believe this preposterous notion at first , then Micheal comes to help . . . . This tale was better than the first one , but even though it is enjoyable enough and boosts a nice twist , it's still nothing that special . Which brings as to the third , last & hands down best story in this movie , " Bobby " , in which a long deceased boy is brought back to life via the dark magiks that his distressed , grief-stricken mother partakes in . She's jubilant to find him at her door , but things soon turn sour as he's different now & playing sadistic games with mommy dearest . For all the horror and tension that the first two stories lacked , this one makes up for it . . . . in spades . Lee Montgomery is suitably frightening as the titular Bobby and it remains one of the best short horrors ever made for American TV ( now if only the first two parts were even half as good ) DVD Extras : deleted / extended from the ' no such thing as a vampire ' segment ; alternate intro vioceovers ; Music score highlights ; the unaired 1968 pilot episode of ' Dead of Night ' ( A Darkness at Blaisedon ) ; & a photo gallery
521314	1162550	392391	7.0	interesting	This 69 minute documentary on the making of " the Italian Job " can be found on the Special Collecter's Edition of the aforementioned movie . It's split in 3 parts or you can watch them in a ' play all ' option . The first part " The Great Idea " focuses on the fruition of the story for the movie , the second " The Self-Preservation Society " deals with the supporting cast , and the last segment " Get a Bloomin ' move on " focusing on the cars and music . All these segments feature informative interviews and learning more about the already great movie , made me appreciated the film all the more . Easily among the best documentaries that I've seen . And while it's certainly not in the top echelon ( " Full Tilt Boogie " , " Apocalypse Soon " , " Heart of Darkness " , Etcatra ) It's still worthwhile viewing .
520569	1162550	83542	8.0	Sholder's first film remains his best	Three murderous nut-jobs , pyromaniac Byron ( Martin Landau ) , obese child molester Victor Salva ( no I'm just kidding , this fatty likes young GIRLS ) , and the leader , murderous sociopath Frank ( Jack Palance ) break out of an experimental asylum during a blackout . They go to terrorize Dr . Potter , a new phychiatrist whom they think has murdered their previous doctor in this little known horror gem from the ' 80's . What the film lacks in plot coherence , it more then makes up for in a feeling of tension throughout . Great acting by all ( especially the late great Donald Pleasence as Dr . Leo Bain , played in a way 180 degrees from his more famous Dr . Sam Loomis of the " Halloween " films ) Some great lines , and a few solid laughs towards the beginning . Eye Candy : Carol Levy shows her mosquito bites My grade : DVD Extras : Commentary with Director Jack Sholder ; 16 & a half minute Interview with punk band ' The Sic Fcks ' ( WOW , they haven't aged well ) ; 16 & a half minute Carol Levy Interview ( I'd STILL do her ) ; Poster art & lobby card Gallery ; and the red-band Theatrical trailer
521287	1162550	355458	8.0	simple , to the point , i like it	Having some free time on my hands I decided to watch some short films on Atomfilms . " Frei Parken " ( or Free Parking ) runs around 7 minutes and tells the simple story of a woman trying to get a parking space , but there are a few obstacles in her path . This feeling is universal and of course it's dramatized for entertainment porpoises but overall it's just a fun little short film . This is what short films should be about . No complex plots , no experimental filming techniques to satisfy you and your art house friends . Just quick in , quick out and leave them waiting more . Kudos to Bernhard Jasper and to a lesser extant Christopher Roth
520692	1162550	368859	8.0	2005's AVN award winner for best film	Jim Mitchell ( Justine Serling ) is a lonely , somewhat creepy guy , whom bored with his dreary life decides to go to a masseuse named Barbara ( Jenna Jameson ) . He starts spending more and more time with her , becoming more and more obsessed , not caring that his co-worker ( Maya Divine ) is attracted to him . This is a remake of Paul Thomas's own 1990 original and I just have to say even though I do like the original version , I enjoyed this remake a bit more . Furthermore , I've never been one for more than light bondage , but seeing Jenna tied up like that was really hot . But when the action isn't focused on Jenna and Justin , the film tends to falter a bit . My Porn
519845	1162550	206467	8.0	cut off to early	Peter Dragon , ( Jay Mohr ) is an arrogant , narcissistic , biligeren movie producer . But after his newest film " Slow Torture " bombs badly , he's also in dire need of a hit . This series revolves around him trying to get that hopeful hit " Beverly Hills Gun Club " off the ground and made , dealing with his ex-prostitute turned VP of production , a closeted gay leading action hero , drug-addled replacment leading man , heavily put upon writer , fat actess , and finding funding for it all . Sadly this only lasted 8 episodes on Fox ( 5 additional would be shown on sister cable network , FX ) before cancellation , perhaps it was easy to predict as the show had black humor , & sharp satire . Perhaps it was a tad too ' inside ' to appeal to the appointed time-slot it was given . But it was also hilarious and witty in spades . Well-acted all around , it's a shame it wasn't able to stay on a bit longer . Thankfully , the un-bleeped DVD set ( I Won't call it uncensored , as the nudity is still black boxed out ) is out so others can see what they missed out on .

JP Delahoussaye ( man , that's a mouthful ) plays Fuad Ramses , the grandson of the original Istar worshiping nut-zoid . Anyways he re-opens the old place & before long he's in his own grandfather's nut-zoid footsteps . The film plays for high camp . Some of the jokes are inane , the acting . . . . well it IS a B horror movie , & it's a tad long ( could have been trimmed by about half an hour ) .

But for true fans of the exploitation genre it falls in the top 5 of all time . Yes , some scenes are hard to sit through . Yes the subject matter is tasteless . Yet nearly 30 years after it's releases it's STILL being talked about . For such a low-budgeted picture like this is just amazing . For the squeamish among you STAY AWAY from this movie . All others proceed with caution . DVD Extras : Commentary by Producer David F . Friedman , Director Don Edmunds , star Dyanne Thorne & humorist Martin Lewis ; Theatrical Trailer ; Bios for David F .

Starting when Van Damme insulted Zito and ending in the fight , I found the story fascinating , captivating , and at turns humorous to listen to listen to . He also goes briefly into his love life and takes a few phone calls . But the episode mostly revolve's around the Van Damme incident . Needless to say , Zito proves to be a pretty good interview and it kept me entertained throughout .
520650	1162550	949815	8.0	more of a love letter than a true documentary , but great none the less	More of a tribute to a comedic legend than a true documentary , this John Landis directed love letter to the great Mr . Rickles is pretty good none the less . Consisting of various actors and directors of note giving their ( naturally ) praise for the beloved comedian , interspersed with clips from his Vegas shows , late show appearances , old films , Friars ' Roasts , and home movies with longtime friend , Bob Newhart . While the film does have a very small amount of missteps editing and a few instances where it veers off-topic to ill effect , for the most part it's quite highly enjoyable and hilarious to boot . Any true fan ( myself included ) of Don will no doubt treasure it and watch it multiple times . So what ya waiting ' for ? Go check it out on HBO while it's still on , Hockey Puck .
520919	1162550	90770	8.0	The Decline of Western Civilization Part 1 . 5 : The psycho years	Roy and his hetero life-mate Bo are psychopaths who have a night of killing in LA . This movie , while not that great , is still good and MILES above the very over-rated crap fest that was " Natural Born Killers " . Penelope Spheeris does a pretty good job directing and Charlie Sheen plays Bo low-key to nice effect . This is also the only film I can stand Maxwell Caulfield in , so don't even mention " Grease 2 " , " Empire Records " or any of his other less-then-stellar ( to put them VERY mildly ) movies to me . Plus I like pretty much everything that Glen Morgan and James Wong write , well they only have one bad film to their credit . Or rather their only bad film is " The One " . Thankfully this is not " the One " Look for Moon Unit Zappa in a small role . Anchor Bay DVD Extras : Commentary with Penelope and Maxwell ; Cast and crew info ; and Theatrical Trailer

All the while trying to dissuade a public from hating all of them . This was one of the first superhero films that opted for a more serious tone as opposed to the campy ones that preceded it , and for the most part works , True there were a few things I would have changed ( Glenn Danzig would've made a more kick ass Wolverine , I never warmed up to Halle Barry as Storm ) , but all the other actors are very good ( particularly , Ian McKellen as a spot-on Magneto ) . And the storyline is deep , yet remains still extremely accessible . Followed by a sequel that wasn't as good .

It features interviews with pretty much every cast and crew member still living ( barring Dennis Hopper for some unknown reason ) . Casting , pre-production , production , post are all covered here . As well as Sam Packinpah's troubles . But it's a testimony to the acclaimed director that he got the cast merely because it was him doing it . It's all pretty interesting and informative , and it's always nice to hear from Rutger Hauer . Not as good as say " Full Tilt Boogie " but movie documentaries rarely are .

Jerry think he's saved onto to realize that the second cat just wants to eat him himself . What follows is classic slapstick as the two cats fight over who gets the meal . But they both get their just desserts in the end . Tom and Jerry are in their top form here and are a delight to watch as they ALMOST are ( the feature film where they're best pals is horrid , but I digress ) . This hilarious cartoon can be found on disc one of the Spotlight collection DVD of " Tom & Jerry "

After a series of death , Detective ( Robert Forster ) is tasked with capturing the abnormally large creature . Forster is great in this movie , as he usually is & makes the movie far more enjoyable then it has any right being . Furthermore the alligator itself is pretty cool and could pulverize any of the lame CGI creature features of today . ( for proof merely witness the terrific gator vs . wedding scene ) This classic was followed by a sequel that just didn't have the same magic .

However he gets a larger dose then he thought that he was going to get and thus the incredible Hulk was born .

Tommy Dunn ( David Ferry of Boondock Saints ) is the sad sack pugilist who can't win a fight to save his life until he comes into possession of the aforementioned gloves . It's up to the trio to get the accursed things back . This is the first really memorable episode of the series and I enjoyed it immensely . A bad guy you love to hate , a nice suitably evil antique , and a great ending makes this on a winner by K . O . Even the lip service given to Micki's not often talked about ( and better off that way ) fiancé during the first few minutes of the episode doesn't put a crimp on my overall enjoyment of it .
520158	1162550	130236	9.0	Melissa Moore's " lost " film	A womanizing super samurai cop and his black side-kick go after the Yakuza . This film is bad . . REALLY bad , it's also pretty damn funny . Matt Hannon stars as the samurai cop who looks more like a gay poolboy in the best movie of his long varied career of one film . Robert Z'dar ( Maniac Cop ) is the right-hand man of the bad guy . Definately a guilty pleasure movie with it's jaw-droppingly insanely stupid dialog , the horrible " action " , the unneeded flamingly gay waiter , and well you just have to see it for yourself . My bad-movie grade : AMedia Blaster Dvd Extras : Joe Bob Brigg's intro and commentary ! ! !

519486	1162550	338564	9.0	a modern masterpiece	A triad mole ( Andy Lau ) in who has infiltrated the police department has to find a undercover cop ( Tony Leung ) who's deep in the triad and vice versa in this superb film from Wai Keung Lau and Siu Fai Mak . Of course now that the American re-make is out , it's impossible not to compare the two . But I feel that they each can pretty much stand on their own merits . The acting's great in both . While the remake clearly wins in the violence and glossy shine departments , it also leaves out a lot of the emotional layers and complexities of this one . I love both movies equally and am hard pressed to pick one over the other . However I WILL say that this original has the better ending absolutely . Followed by a prequel and sequel , neither of which I've seen as of yet , but I have part 2 geared up in the DVD player as I write this .
521176	1162550	43037	9.0	Tom trying to pitch woo	Tom the Cat is having fun with Jerry the mouse in the old West lassoing him up . Until a girl cat comes along and sets Tom's heart on fire . He waists no time in trying to woo her . Of course Jerry doesn't want Tom happy . So he , along with some help from a bull , try to put the kibosh on Tom's chance at love . The hit to miss joke ratio in this one is greatly in favor of the hits . And it's very enjoyable throughout . Of course I'm biased as i pretty much love anything by the cat & mouse duo . This hilarious classic cartoon can be found on disc two of the Spotlight collection DVD of " Tom & Jerry " My grade :
521025	1162550	94625	9.0	Anime 101	31 years after World War 3 , two friends in a violent bike gang find themselves on two sides , albeit unwillingly , of opposing viewpoints in this epic anime of government conspiracy and genetic tampering . It's a rich , complex story if one chooses to watch it with an open mind . And while not without it's fair share of flaws , it's an extremely rewarding experience and ranks among the very best that you'll likely find in the Anime genre . It's extremely fast-paced , viciously violent , very bloody , and has a interesting message to boot . What's not to like ? 2-disc special edition DVD Extras : Disc 1 ) English translation of graffiti option ( which is cool and all , but not really needed ) Disc 2 ) A 48 minute Making of ; Akira sound clip ; Interview with director Katsuhiro Otomo ; Interviews with restoration staff ; Stills gallery ; and Teaser & Theatrical trailers
520324	1162550	469287	9.0	first great game for the 360 ( deffinately not the last )	This was one of the first xbox 360 games that I bought , and along with Project Gotham Racing 3 and the recently released DOA 4 are proof that the 360 is indeed a next-generation system . The game look pretty good on a regular TV set , but on a HD capable TV with surround sound the superb game truly comes to life with amazing graphics and intense sounds . The bullets whizzing by your head , the fights your fellow soldiers are engaging in , and all the other sounds truly immerse you deeply in the game . Of course any true hardcore game wouldn't try the game in anything less than the Veteran setting , which is particularly unforgiving ( especially the later American levels ) All in all this is a simply great game and is one of the few MUST OWN ones if you managed to get your hands on a 360 . It rivals any but the most maxed out computers currently out . ( note : this review was written at the time of the game's release , but since the page on it didn't exist on IMDb then , I'm posting it now )
520212	1162550	756449	9.0	old allies , older enemies	Starting with Rose's heart-breaking monologue and ending in quite possibly the best cliffhanger for a Doctor Who two-parter in recent memory , this episode is full of surprises , returning characters both good as well as evil , great characterization , and more . It's just brilliant all around . The only drawbacks are that it's steeped in Who mythology and for those who for some reason to choose this as their first episode of the current incarnation of Doctor Who will be lost and the other thing is not a detriment of the show in the least . More a detriment to me , as so much happens that I truly can't talk about the actual plot too much without spoiling it . And trust me , this IS an episode you'd want to go into knowing nothing about . My grade :
520600	1162550	40515	9.0	tom and jerry at their most pure	Tom is chasing Jerry when the mouse befriends a small canary . A lot of the gags work and hearing Tom's laugh is infectious . And the canary is one of the third characters that I like , unlike the buzzard for Flirty Birdy or the fish from Cat Fishin ' . All in all this is a pretty funny violent Tom and Jerry short . This hilarious cartoon can be found on disc one of the Spotlight collection DVD of " Tom & Jerry " DVD Extras : Commentary by historian Jerry Beck on how this is his favorite Tom and Jerry cartoon , talks about Jerry's sidekicks , and the animators ( kinda sparse , with some silent parts )
520032	1162550	25318	10.0	Fields second best film	W . C . Fields is Harold Bissonette , the owner of a general store who is endlessly tormented by his family . After he gets an inheritance from his deceased relative he longs to buy an Orange Ranch . This is my second favorite Fields film ( behind the great " Bank Dick ) There are so many memorable comedic moments in this one and it's a sheer joy to watch W . C Fields one of my favorite comedians at the top of his game . This movie can be found in the W . C . Fields comedy collection , along with , " The Bank Dick " , " My Little Chickadee " , " You Can't Cheat an Honest Man " , " International House " , and " W . C . Fields : Behind the Laughter "
520064	1162550	1000256	10.0	simply amazing	In the second part of this utterly amazing Doctor who two-parter , The ' Family ' have now found the still now human Doctor , putting those he holds dearest in dire jeopardy . I was really hoping that this was as good as the previous installment . Well I was wrong . Why ? Because it was slighter better if that's at all possible . This two-parter can easily rank right up there with the best of the Doctor Who stories . Great acting , a truly compelling plot line , quite simply marvelous in every way . Now if only all New Who episodes could be as good , I'd be more than ecstatic .
520065	1162550	1000254	10.0	Everything a Who story SHOULD be	In order to give the slip to some enemies that have him cornered , the Doctor chooses to erase his own memory . Using the old alias of John Smith , he winds up as a teacher in a finishing school in 1913 . Now completely human , he must deal with human feelings such as true love . Martha is tasked with keeping an eye on him while the crises passes , but as always with the Doctor's adventures , it's not quite that easy . Now THIS is what I'm talking about ! This is everything a good Doctor Who tale should be , an extremely well-acted , captivating , marvelous story with memorable , suitably threatening villains and no over-reliance on CGI . If the second half holds up as well , it'll be ranked amongst the best episodes of Who in decades .
