461803	2467618	70996	1.0	this show makes me ill , . . .	Ugghhh ! ! ! The 1970s were an abysmal period for cartoons . They were terribly animated and were written to appeal only to very young kids and incredibly stupid people . And , the king of this genre at the time was Hanna-Barbera - - who made a huge fortune peddling 4th-rate cartoons to kids . The networks loved it because the cartoons were so cheap to produce and with so many rotten cartoons on , the standards were pretty low . While I was a kid in the 70s , I lost interest very fast thinks to cartoons like Speed Buggy and Hong Kong Phooey . They were just mind-numbingly bad - - unfunny and devoid of anything that seemed like quality ! If you think a karate chopping dog could be funny , then you have NOT seen this cartoon ! Watch this only at your own risk - - you have been warned .
463729	2467618	265870	1.0	Bad , but not even a " good " bad film	In its original form , this was called THE MADMEN OF MANDORAS , but shown in the States it was retitled THEY SAVED HITLER'S BRAIN and some additional footage was added . The story is about a group of Nazis who decided to cut off Hitler's head and shove it in a pickle jar until they could later re-attach it to another body and create a 4th Reich . To show us how bad Hitler was , before cutting off his head he screamed and ranted like someone who THINKS they are talented and can pretend to speak in German . Then , inside the jar , you see a head that looks like wax and yet can somehow speak - - yelling " macht schnell ! " again and again . I just kept thinking to myself " if they can smuggle Hitler's head out of Germany , then WHY cut off the head - - can't they just take ALL of him ? ! " . While this might not technically be the worst film ever made , it is very close - - and totally inept throughout . However , unfortunately , it is NOT timeless like bad films like PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE because unlike PLAN 9 , THEY SAVED HITLER'S BRAIN is a very dull film . You know , the sort of film that is bad but not fun to watch with friends to laugh at how bad it was . Take my advice , for a bad but fun film try PLAN 9 or TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE or ATTACK OF THE KILLER SHREWS - - this film is just boring and not worth your time .
461796	2467618	281433	1.0	Amazingly bad	This cartoon is about the only animated cartoon series that MIGHT have been as bad as the animated Hercules cartoons of the 60s ( from Trans Lux TV ) . The show was astoundingly bad . So bad that Hanna and Barbera at their lowest point would have refused to put their names on it bad ! So bad that children suddenly remember they have some homework to do when it comes on bad ! The worst aspect of the show was the crappy animation . A slide show would have seemed less wooden and static ! And the stories themselves bore only a superficial resemblance to the cartoon strip . And the dialog , . . . I've read better dialog on ads for zit creams ! If you have Bright House cable , you may be able to see this monstrosity for yourself to see if I am right . It's been listed on their cartoon on demand channel , so if you do have the chance , watch it - - unless you aren't a masochist . Oh , and by the way . Despite what others may have said , the show was NOT faithful in any way to the cartoon strip . It wasn't even close !
460599	2467618	50432	1.0	The duck from " You Bet Your Life " was more realistic and scary ! !	This is a truly terrible sci-fi / horror film from 1957 . In fact , despite Ed Wood , Jr . and his dreadful films getting a lot of publicity , this turkey is every bit as bad as the worst of Wood . Now the acting is a bit better than you'd find in the Wood epics ( such as PLAN 9 and BRIDE OF THE MONSTER ) , but the special effects managed to be significantly worse than Wood's ! However , bad movie aficionados will be happy to hear that it's so bad that it's still excellent viewing . Like a Wood film , it's great to watch this crap-fest and laugh along with your friends . The film begins with a scientist flying about doing some testing in his jet . However , out of nowhere , a UFO streaks by and his report of this over the radio triggers a panic by the Air Force . However , later , they realized that the UFO didn't appear on the radio and they think the scientist is a nut ! But , when soon after this planes start disappearing all over , they realize there must be something to his sighting . So far , the film isn't great but it's watchable . However , by the time the horrible flying monster appears , you know you're watching a turkey . First , through horrid use of stock film and crappy models , airplanes keep changing mid-flight . Some may not be bothered by this , but with airplane lovers like me , seeing an F-80 turning into an F-86 to an F-102 fighter plane made me crazy - - especially since the planes look nothing like each other . Second , through " clever " cinematography , all you really see of the monster is a ball of fuzz for half the film ! This is frustrating and you hope that when you finally do see it clearly , it will be worth the wait . Well , no such luck ! ! The " monster " looks less realistic or scary than the duck from Groucho's " You Bet Your Life " TV show ! ! In fact , it's significantly less realistic than any of the Japanese giant monsters ! ! In fact , Big Bird from " Sesame Street " is even a bit scarier and realistic ! ! ! It's just god-awful in every way and might just be the dumbest movie monster in history - - about as bad ( or worse ) as the monsters in ROBOT MONSTER or TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE ! ! ! The bottom line is that this is an absolutely dreadful film that sane people won't like . Bad film fans like me ( who are a crazy bunch ) will probably love it ! All others . . . be afraid , . . . . be VERY afraid ! ! FYI - - You might notice that some clips in this film are from other sci-fi movies ! ! I am positive the crashing Washington Monument scene was stolen from EARTH VS . THE FLYING SAUCERS but I also saw a couple other scenes that I swear are from other films . What a hack job !
461270	2467618	258098	1.0	As exciting as dirt	Even by the very low quality standards of the day , this is a dreadfully boring film . Dull , boring and seemingly pointless . Yes , I know that in the 1890s and very early 1900s films were snippets of mundane everyday activities - - but this one is beyond mundane ! ! It's a short , short film that shows the surf . And , while folks living in Kansas and other totally landlocked places must have been exciting to actually see the ocean , this couldn't have even been that interesting to most of the patrons back in 1900 ! And , believe it or not , this is not the only film from that era I have seen with the exact same subject matter ! ! In 1895 , Birt Acres made a very similar film of a rougher and more interesting surf . It had better composition and being from 1895 , it deserved a much higher score . If you have not seen this film , fill your sink with water and swirl it . This will still probably be more interesting .
460076	2467618	88885	1.0	There are so many better and less annoying kids films out there	Call me a curmudgeon , but I absolutely hate the Care Bears and wish they had never been created . They are , without a doubt , the most saccharine and bland characters created in the last 30 years . So sweet , so nice that you really wish that there was a movie that paired them with Itchy and Scratchy ! ! ! Now I am not really saying I want the really little kids out there to see ultra-violent films , but there gets to be a point when a film is so non-offensive and sweet that it nearly puts the viewers in a diabetic coma ! This means , parents , that if you are suckered into watching this with your kids , you are in for a trip to Hades ! I just can't see how any sane adult could stand watching these horrid creatures for more than about 20 seconds . On top of these complaints , the animation quality is poor and the script is so mindless and insipid that ANYTHING must be better for the kids to watch . This stuff makes the Teletubbies look edgy !
460140	2467618	70071	2.0	Frankly . . . far from fabulous .	This Oscar-winning animation is a giant headache and could easily be used by evil , repressive governments to torture and brainwash their people and is one of the best examples of a truly awful film that somehow won this award . While I can definitely appreciate the effort it took making this film ( cutting out thousands and thousands of magazine pictures to make collages ) , the problem is that it is so cacophonous . You see , the sound track consists of two alternate scripts being read CONSTANTLY throughout the film . Both narrators are the same person . One constantly repeats words starting with the F-sound while the other talks ad nauseum about his very dull life - - during which time these collages appear and disappear rapidly . The film has no commercial appeal whatsoever and is great for people who like artsy and pretentious film - - otherwise beware , as it's totally painful and annoying .
462818	2467618	414	3.0	Dopey	While the idea of this film isn't bad , the execution is rather poor - - even for 1902 . The character " Uncle Josh " ( who appeared in at least one other Edison film ) goes to the theater and sees some short films ( the same type usually shown at the time ) . He is supposedly such a rube that he can't tell it isn't real and spends most of the time mugging for the camera and wildly overacting next to the screen . However , later the stupid guy sees a lady on screen with another man and plans on making sweet love to the lady . When he jumps at her , he rips down the curtain and reveals the rear-projected projector - - at which point the guy running the show starts hitting stupid old Uncle Josh . While I do like many of the early films and have a VERY HIGH TOLERANCE for them ( even though many are very rough and not all that good ) , this one stands out for terrible acting and overall cheesiness . Try to find another early Edison film - - ANY of them would possibly be preferable !
461002	2467618	35460	3.0	horrible casting and terrible stereotypes abound	I don't know if Hispanics are offended by this film . My frustration with this film is NOT because I am politically correct ( I am proud that I am NOT ) , but because the casting and performances were just so stupid . So , even if most are NOT offended , I was offended by how stupid the studio thought the viewers were to believe that Spencer Tracy , Heddy Lamarr , John Garfield and Sheldon Leonard were even the least bit plausible as CHICANOS ! ! Come off it - - I think Hattie McDaniel or Maureen O'Hara would have been about as believable if they'd been offered these roles ! As a result , it looked more like a performance of Jose Jimenez than a drama about the plight of these poor immigrants .
463640	2467618	52888	3.0	It's not terrible - - fun for fans of cheesy horror and all others should beware	My score of 3 doesn't really mean that I hated this film . In fact , I enjoy watching cheesy 1950s and 60s horror films . However , no matter how much I enjoy them , I have to be realistic and admit that their technical merits are usually horrendous . With THE HIDEOUS SUN DEMON ( a rather inappropriate title , by the way ) , the budget was next to nothing and it really shows . The script also is not particularly inspired or original , though the film is watchable . Actor Robert Clarke stars in this film he also wrote and co-directed . While his name is probably not one you've heard of before , he did a ton of TV appearances over the years - - particularly in the 1960s in such shows as " Dragnet " . He's a competent actor though given the budget , you really can't blame him for coming up with a silly film . This is another nuclear radiation film where a scientist is exposed to the stuff . But , instead of turning really big ( THE AMAZING COLOSSAL MAN ) or tiny ( THE AMAZING SHRINKING MAN ) , here the guy cannot go into sunlight or he becomes a hideous looking monster - - at least until he's left the sunlight and allows himself to become normal once again . To me I kept wondering why Clarke's character was so stupid that he'd " forget " and suddenly realize it's becoming daytime throughout the film . People with Porphyria learn to avoid sunlight , yet this dummy keeps making the mistake of being out too long . Unfortunately , when he is out in the sun , he seems to become a bit emotionally unstable , though he's nothing like a " sun demon " . He's more like a guy who's a bit cranky and stupid , that's all ! Overall , very watchable for fans of the genre but don't expect it to be among the best . Just a typical film you'd find on a typical exceptionally tiny budget . By the way , look at the box art that is shown on IMDb . I think the yellow artwork might just rank as the ugliest in film history .
461528	2467618	36548	3.0	A big step backwards for the Sergeant Doubleday films	This B-movie was one of a long series of war comedies starring William Tracy as the bright and lovable Sergeant Doubleday . While I loved the very first film , TANKS A MILLION , the series was pretty uneven - - with some being very good and a few ( like this one ) being pretty poor excuses for movies . My score of three might be as low as it is because I knew that these Hal Roach produced films COULD be enjoyable and original - - this one was not . In fact , in some ways it was like a dull film with bits of 3 Stooges thrown in for good measure . In this film , Doubleday and his annoying friend Ames were shipping out overseas to action . As usual , Ames is Doubleday's foil and I think this is a major weakness of these films . After a couple films , Ames becomes very tiresome and his character just grates on you . He's ALWAYS selfish , stupid and trying to hurt his friend Doubleday - - and after a while you start to think " what's funny about that ? " . In TANKS A MILLION , it worked well - - here it's just bad . Plus again and again , second-rate gags are used that just don't provide laughs . Unfortunately , the film also does not end well - - the Japanese sub segment is just lame . Oh , and while I am ranting about Ames , I thought I'd throw in a few words about continuity . From film to film , continuity is a major problem . Ames is a master sergeant in his first film , but stripes keep disappearing in subsequent films - - even though time and again his superior officers praise him and he is rewarded for brains and courage . Also , the sweet Ames goes from girl to girl in the films - - making him seem pretty fickle since he is engaged to a couple of them ! Unfortunately , the only real constant in the films is Ames . Why , oh why Ames ? ! If you are a fan of the series and MUST see them all , then by all means watch this one . If not , then see TANKS A MILLION and leave it at that . The film is one of the best war comedies of the 40s - - perhaps THE best and a lot funnier and timeless than the very popular BUCK PRIVATES . Oh , and the other reviewer is right - - the helmets were worn backwards throughout the film !
459699	2467618	89731	3.0	do not watch this if you are depressed - - it'll only make it worse	I thought this was one of the most depressing holiday movies I have ever seen - - the others being THE Christmas WIFE and JACK FROST . All three movies are about death . If you LIKE being thoroughly depressed , then by all means watch this film or any of the others . In this film , the acting is good and some of the scenery ( apart when people are dying ) is lovely . But , I am worried that a clinically depressed person might accidentally see the film and do themselves in ! Despite a " happily ever after " ending , the major portion of this film is one awful disaster following another . And , for some crazy reason , I DON'T WANT TO BE DEPRESSED when I watch a Christmas movie ( I know this sounds crazy folks - - after all , isn't bawling your eyes out and feeling miserable what the holidays are all about anyway ? ) . For a more uplifting viewing experience , try the forgotten HOUSE WITHOUT A Christmas TREE , George C . Scott's Christmas CAROL or A Christmas STORY instead - - unless of course you like being miserable .
464183	2467618	52735	4.0	is it just me or did this movie get kinda stupid after a while ?	While I was VERY glad to see a movie involving the Colonial period in America ( since so few movies talk about this ) , I really didn't enjoy this movie all that much - - despite the time period and the great actors . And I really WANTED to like it . But , the story just seemed very childish and stupid after a while - - the comedy , though originally subtle became more broad ( especially the Douglas character ) . Now with some films , you expect a certain degree of silliness and unbelievability , but with this one it was really tough because the film itself didn't seem sure of its tone - - should it be a serious melodrama or a slapstick comedy ? Well , for me it just seemed muddled and a bit embarrassing to watch . Too bad , as I expected more from Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas .
462189	2467618	122498	4.0	This film was missing something	I guess I am the dissenting vote here , but I didn't particularly like GASMAN . Some of it isn't the fault of those who made the film , but was the fault of the people who put this film on disk . That's because the accents were at times very hard for me to understand and there was no captioning on the DVD . To the average American , some British accents are tough to understand and my mild hearing loss made this a particularly frustrating film . However , what the film makers could have done better was providing a context for this short film . You gather that the man has two families but you are left asking so many questions that aren't explained in the film . In other words , it's a short film that has left out key portions of the narrative - - and this just seemed sloppy . It's too bad , because the basic idea behind the short was interesting . By the way , this film is part of the CINEMA 16 : European Shorts DVD . On this DVD are 16 shorts . Most aren't great , though because it contains THE MAN WITHOUT A HEAD , COPY SHOP , RABBIT and WASP , it's an amazing DVD for lovers of short films and well worth buying - - it's just a shame about the captioning .
458687	2467618	765497	4.0	Wow . . . . was that unpleasant .	This was a well acted film but the subject is so unappealing I really have no idea who the intended audience is . This short film purports to be a video entry from a man who talks about how " the sickness followed us to the new house " and as he cries and tries to explain what happened in a very fragmented manner , you gather that he's a schizophrenic who feels a compulsion to stop the pain - - - and you see clips of a wife who is tied up with her mouth duck taped shut . The man then goes from room to room - - killing his child , his wife and finally himself . It's all very , very realistic and I see that the people who made it had some professional skills - - making the film seem very real . BUT , who would want to see what seems to be a confession of a maniac ! ? This is so thoroughly unpleasant and I didn't think the payoff was worth it . These talented people , however , should not give up - - just pick something with some appeal to more than just a very tiny audience .
460435	2467618	122158	4.0	The best gay Avant Garde Biblical film I have ever seen !	Okay , I'll admit that it is the ONLY gay Avant Garde Biblical film I have ever seen , . . . but by default it is definitely the best . It's a pretty strange little film , though compared to the rest of the short films from the Kino Video Avant Garde collection , it's pretty " normal " and approachable for the average viewer . However , I am really not sure exactly who the audience is for this strange art film . After all , gay audiences probably won't enjoy all the religious content and Bible verses - - especially when the people of Sodom are damned . And , due to the homo-erotic imagery , most deeply religious people will be at least super-duper hesitant to watch the film ! So , unless you really want something very different and pretty oddly creative , this film probably won't be one that will change your life or get to to watch it more than once . I gotta say , though , that the inventive camera-work is pretty cool and the film is in many ways like a piece of Pop Art . If you ARE looking for an " artsy " film but find this type of film I described sounds too unusual or esoteric , maybe you should try the films of the great French artist / director Jean Cocteau . Other than his BLOOD OF A POET , his other films combine artistry and Avant Garde imagery with well-constructed plots and familiar movie elements . My favorites of his films are Orphée ( Orpheus ) and La Belle et la bête ( Beauty and the Beast ) .
460055	2467618	174707	4.0	Amazingly sick stuff . . . .	Warning : This is one of the most amazingly adult and disturbing films I have seen in a very long time ! Despite it appearing on The Independent Film Channel , the content is far more adult than what you'd normally see on this cable channel . Don't say I didn't warn you ! ! I am a huge fan of the Zatoichi series , so it's not surprising that I decided to watch the first Hansho the Razor film . However , instead of playing a combination of a ronin ( a master-less traveling samurai ) and social worker like Zatoichi , here in Goyôkiba , Shintarô Katsu plays a policeman with very , very , very unorthodox methods - - - very , very , very ADULT and unorthodox methods . I was shocked to see that the nice character he once played was now into sadomasochism and spends much of his time torturing himself and doing amazingly brutal things to his penis in order to turn it into a . . . well , . . . a . . . . super-penis , of sorts . If this wasn't disturbing enough , the reason for this ( other than the fact he has found a way to masturbate that's MORE disturbing than auto-erotic asphyxiation ) is that he uses his super-member to rape women as he questions them about crimes or pumps them for information ( no pun intended ) . And , to play into the age-old rape myth , the ladies being brutalized by this all have immensely pleasurable climaxes and give themselves totally to this sicko cop . Considering how offensive and sick the first film from the series was , it's actually pretty surprising I watched this second installment from the series . I guess part of me wondered if the other Hansho films could be as gross and sick as the first one . Well , while Hansho is still a very sick puppy , he rapes fewer and the film isn't as explicit as the first one . Now this isn't saying much , as it's still a very adult film with themes that should disturb people . Oddly , however , as I read through the comments , people seemed to like that this cop rapes women " who have it coming " ! This film has two plots that intersect . The first involves a temple which has been turned into a brothel by a government official . Instead of the usual Shinto nunnery , here the place is filled with ladies who have been drugged and are abused in all sorts of sadistic ways . While Hansho has no jurisdiction here , like Dirty Harry , he jumps right in because of his own sense of justice . However , as this justice involves taking the mistress of the nunnery captive and torturing and then raping her , he's an especially guy - - far more than Clint Eastwood's character ever could have been . Naturally , however , the lady comes to love and need Hansho because he is apparently such a stud . A great message to tell the audience - - torture and rape someone and they'll be your friend for life ! ! ! Later , Hansho is sent to defend a local mint from attack . While this seems like a totally different plot , the government official who sends him is the same one who ran the brothel AND this new assignment also calls for a rape - - though the lady who is victimized seemed like she was innocent . Oh well , it's all in the line of duty ! While still a sick movie and it's obvious that Shintarô Katsu is getting way too fat for this role ( as evidenced by his bloated figure and his wearing the unsexiest underwear in the history of film ) , it's not as overtly explicit as the original and there is some decent martial arts action . Still , in hindsight I probably should have just changed the channel .
461300	2467618	121766	4.0	Finally - - - a Star Wars film designed just for kids and dumb people !	Well , at the outset , this film already lost a point or two from me since it , once again , features that nauseating character " Jar-Jar " . While some of my friends pointed out that he wasn't in this film as much as in the previous two , having him in the film at all makes me hate the movie . Why George Lucas dogmatically refused to admit that this character was a HUGE marketing mistake AND that he even went back to the earlier films to add him into irrelevant scenes for the DVD release is beyond me . Obviously , he is NOT a person who can admit he was wrong ! All the unpurchased Jar-Jar merchandise sitting on store shelves as well as all the " I hate Jar-Jar " web sites SHOULD be an indication that he is less than loved by the public ! Now apart from that , the film is very lovely to look at - - with great special effects and tons of eye candy for the viewer . You can't fault the action . However , I also think this film was designed for dumb people , as literate and non-cerebrally impaired people will notice that the dialog is simply one cliché after another . I know this may sound arrogant , but George Lucas wrote horrid dialog . When it comes to logic , this is also often missing from the film . I felt like screaming during at the scene where Vader is battling in a volcano - - yet he doesn't break a sweat and only is injured when he eventually falls into the molten goo . He and his nemesis would have been vaporized long before touching the stuff and also would have choked to death on noxious fumes . Apparently this volcano only releases oxygen and is only hot to the touch ! Additionally , while little kids loved it , when Yoda does his ninja-Jedi fighting scene , I was horrified at its stupidity . It was simply intended to entertain the lowest common denominator in the theater and was completely out of character . Many adults , I assume , cringed during these awful scenes . When I compare this film to the earlier films , I am left saddened . Couldn't they have found a better script or at least edited it before filming began ? Or perhaps gotten a professional script writer . What a disappointment .
462846	2467618	70948	4.0	Not horrible . . . and sort of like FELLINI SATYRICON combined with BARBARELL	This is a weird psychedelic-style movie from the 70s that probably could not be made today , as this movie was NOT commercially-oriented and seemed designed for a " hip " audience - - the average person then , as now , would probably have no interest in this film . While I like sci-fi and did like SOME aspects of the film , the weird , " artsy-fartsy " and often sterile nature of the film really put me off and left me thinking that with a re-write , this COULD have been an exceptional film . I like the idea of a dystopia - - a future society that is worse and more repressive than current society ( sort of like BRAVE NEW WORLD or 1984 ) , but in this case the style of the film really annoyed me . The stupid costumes and hairstyles ( that were highly reminiscent of FELLINI SATYRICON ) were just distracting and seemed inspired by LSD . For example , seeing Sean Connery running around with his weird ponytail , strange loin cloth red garb and REALLY hairy body were at first very funny to see . . . at first . But combining this with all the other over-the-top elements just looked like it was the illegitimate step-child of BARBARELLA but with a much more serious and bizarre storyline . And speaking of story , the film did have some good points to make about stagnation and a perpetually ignorant race of slaves was pretty novel and interesting to a point . But the elderly people with dementia and all the other goofy bits just made the story to overwhelming and silly to be taken seriously . An interesting experiment that ultimately failed . By the way , the film has a lot of nudity and is very sexual in nature , and so parents are advised to think about this before letting the kids watch this .
462370	2467618	2553	4.0	It's nice to see the Gish Sisters , but this film is pretty poor	I love seeing Lillian and Dorothy Gish in films . They often played sisters on film and were odd in that they REALLY were sisters . But , aside from that , there really isn't all that much to recommend this film . While it isn't exactly bad ( after all , the movie is about average for a movie from 1912 ) , its melodrama seems really over-the-top and rather silly . After all , the whole " gun through the wall " gimmick just seems like a bizarre and unbelievable plot device just to get the viewers to worry about the Gish Sisters ' safety . Think about it - - have you ever heard or seen anything like this ? And , if it DID happen , don't you think they would have just grabbed the gun ? !
459358	2467618	35151	5.0	A wartime misfire	This is an odd movie for several reasons . First , it stars Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers - - a combination that just didn't seem to work very well . Second , despite Hollywood formula , Ginger marries another man towards the beginning of the film and later runs off with Grant when she finally realizes he's a Nazi shnook ! The problem , though , is that the film just seemed pretty limp and Ginger's overwrought acting didn't seem to help . It was a movie clearly intended to boost the war effort , but just didn't seem to gel into a coherent or even semi-believable film . All-in-all , one of the few misfires of Cary Grant's career and a film well worth skipping and only for his devoted fans .
459094	2467618	52637	5.0	Not a horrible film !	I gave the above summary because many might just assume that this low budget film stinks because it's included in the " 50 Movie Pack - - Chilling Classics " DVD set . This set and others by the same company are mostly films that slipped into the public domain because no one wanted them - - they were THAT bad ! ! And , in most cases , the prints are just awful - - often being dark , fuzzy or out of alignment . However , in the case of THE BLOODY BROOD , this film isn't bad at all - - at least when you consider its rather low pedigree . This film is a very low budget production that stars a familiar face ( Peter Falk ) as the bad guy . He's the unofficial leader of a group of beatnicks who generally don't look like beatnicks ( especially Falk - - though what can you expect from a counter-culture film made in Canada ? ) . Everyone in the group comes to him for inspiration , leadership and it's implied that he's their drug connection ( though oddly they NEVER said he was dealing drugs - - I guess it could have been uranium or stolen lawn jockeys or whatever other illegal activity he was doing ) . One evening , just for kicks , he gets the idea to kill someone for laughs and gets one of his flunkies to help . The unsuspecting victim is a poor delivery boy who is fed a sandwich laced with glass ! When the kid dies , his brother vows to continue the investigation that the police don't seem all that interested in pursuing . Generally , the acting is pretty good compared to other similarly budgeted films and the plot is pretty good as well . It's a nice variation on the famous Leopold and Loeb murder case that was dramatized in COMPULSION . While not as slickly produced and lacking the stars of COMPULSION , in some ways I preferred THE BLOODY BROOD since when the film ends there is an appropriate comeuppance - - something that never really happened with Leopold and Loeb . FYI - - For a laugh , watch the scene where they show a close up of the Maynard G . Krebs lookalike as he plays the bongos . If you pay attention , you'll see that his hands and the music aren't even close to being in sync and the tune is significantly faster and different than the hands would indicate - - now THAT'S talent !
462670	2467618	382925	5.0	too short	This film makes fun of Samuel L . Jackson's Bible-quoting hit-man from PULP FICTION . While the wig is a bit big compared to Jackson's , it's perfect for a parody - - as is the actor's imitation of him with his sing-song cadence . While all this is really low-budget , it was a good approximation of the film . I love short films and I really liked PULP FICTION , so when I saw that there was a short parody of PULP FICTION , I was excited . Unfortunately , it was only about a minute long - - leaving me wanting so much more . A nice idea , but simply not enough to make it worth seeking out this short movie . Next time , give us MORE ! !
463949	2467618	35034	5.0	Silly and predictable , but still fun	This is not one of Warner Brothers ' finest films , as the writing is pretty silly at times and terribly predictable . For example , when the character " Pop " appeared , I said to my daughter that that old guy would have to die in the film - - and about 20 minutes later , sure enough , he had assumed room temperature ! In fact , throughout the film , the action was pretty ordinary and often telegraphed . Despite starring Edward G . Robinson , Marlene Dietrich and George Raft , the film had a definite " B-movie " feel to it due to the shallow plot and rather one-dimensional characters . This one-dimensionality was especially true with Robinson , as he was amazingly pugnacious and impossible to believe throughout . Now despite all this and the overall ordinary nature of the film , it still is rather entertaining and worth a look if there is nothing better on television . Not a great film but a decent time-passer . By the way , a few years earlier , Warner Brothers made a somewhat similar film called SLIM . While MANPOWER is not exactly a re-make , they both have a lot of similarities and involve death and danger on the power lines .
459629	2467618	420267	5.0	Very , very dry	This is a short animated film about a group of slackers who work for a local Australian municipality in an office concerned with trees on public property . The animation looks like claymation but could be CGI - - I couldn't tell . At first the film is pretty likable , as the overinflated sense of self-importance held about the job is pretty funny . He behaves like they are a top-notch unit who ensure a better world , while in reality they are a bunch of inefficient dolts . The problem with the film , though , is that this is the entire joke and seeing the people in this office talk and talk about their mundane job becomes rather tiresome . It's a cute idea that really seemed a bit over-long , though I did like the animation and story idea .
458685	2467618	1143096	5.0	Not bad , but . . .	This film is about people held captive and by the end of the film , the lady does what she must to escape . This film seems to be based on a theme that has apparently become a cliché in short independent films . During the last three or four days , I have seen two other short films about people who have been abducted and held prisoner ( ANOTHER LIFE and CAPTIVE ) . So I have to ask " Why do we need so many similar films and what possible excitement can you get from watching this again and again ? ! " . I haven't even looked for these films - - I'm just looking at various shorts posted on IMDb . In addition to this theme , the cold-blooded killer theme is also getting a bit overused as well . I am NOT saying every film needs to be happy , but it is odd that within small independent films , too many are about murder or kidnappings - - yet not very many mainstream films are . Something to ponder . Overall , pretty well made but perhaps they should choose a different topic next time .
460855	2467618	36400	5.0	I finally found two Kurasawa flicks I didn't like	There were many reasons I was unimpressed by this film , though one had was certainly not the fault of anyone connected with the movie . Because this and its sequel are rarely seen , they are hard to come by . I finally found them as an import from MEI AH Laser Disc Company - - and boy did THAT leave a lot to be desired . The quality of the print was very poor ( though MUCH worse on the sequel ) and the captioning was beyond abominable ! When my daughter saw part of it , she immediately recognized the problem . It seems that many Japanese movies are released by Chinese companies , so the movie is translated from Japanese to Chinese and finally to English - - and so much was lost in the translation it practically ruined the experience . For example , " JUDO " is translated as either " Karate " or " Kung Fu " in the movie . If you don't know much about martial arts , there is a world of difference between them . For two movies about Judo , the word NEVER appears in the subtitled version ! Also , countless sentences simply make no sense - - it's as if the words are almost random at times . Now , as far as the movie itself goes , this is a purely ordinary film with very little of the magic of later Kurasawa films . It is a not particularly involving movie about a judo master . Some of the cinematography and acting is very good and at other times it isn't - - it's obvious Kurasawa is still learning his craft . Also , part one is ruined by the fact that part two is a worse film in most ways - - so the viewer never really gets a payoff for seeing the conclusion .
460516	2467618	33105	5.0	odd , . . . . just plain odd , . . . .	This is one of the strangest mainstream movies of its time . That's because the film about escapees from Devil's Island is also an odd religious allegory where Ian Hunter plays a Christ-like being who tries to guide each of the escapees to righteousness before their ultimate demise . At times , the film seems pretty heavy-handed and silly but there is also an odd fascination about the film that keeps you watching . Despite Hunter's odd character , the leads are Clark Gable and Joan Crawford in their final film pairing . She plays a floozy of sorts and Clark plays a variation on the exact same character he often plays - - the cynical anti-hero who isn't really evil but is skirting the edges of the law . Unfortunately , his part isn't new and if he hadn't done so many similar parts , his character would have been a lot more interesting . Overall , the direction and acting are fine , but the often predictability and sappiness of the script ( despite the Hunter character ) prevent this from being a better picture . FYI - - Another film about escapees from Devil's Island that was made only a few years later was Bogart's PASSAGE TO MARSEILLES . Interestingly enough , Peter Lorre and Eduardo Ciannelli appear in both films . Of the two , PASSAGE TO MAREILLES is a slightly better picture .
464495	2467618	188941	5.0	Given that it's 1909 , the film isn't that bad , . . . or that good	I really do admire this film because of its amazing production values for 1909 . While the sets certainly won't rival those of later Roman epics like QUO VADIS or CLEOPATRA , the costumes were awfully good for a time when budgets for films hardly surpassed the cost of film ! So , this is a standout film in this sense . However , when it comes to the style of the film and its value as history , it is of dubious value at best . The acting seems very vague and the actors mostly stand around and wait for the next inter-title card - - there just isn't that much action on film and it seems as if the director was only yelling out a few suggestions here and there as the actors ad-libbed . This really was the style of many early films . Plus , the story is pure hokum - - as if it was written by someone only vaguely aware of the facts . It implies Nero had Rome burned and talks about his love for Poppea , but this is odd since most historians today doubt if Nero had anything to do with the fire AND Nero apparently stomped his " beloved " Poppea to death during a fit of jealousy ! ! So much for the romantic aspect of the film ! So I advise you to watch the film for its historic value and if you are a lover of early cinema . Otherwise , the film is pretty easy for the average person to skip , . . . and maybe that wouldn't be such a bad thing .
460357	2467618	35105	6.0	A decent film , but often it seemed to try a bit too hard .	The film begins in Columbus , Ohio and young Eileen has visions of stardom on the stage - - though she only has worked in community theater . Her older sister , Rosalind Russell , is an aspiring writer and they agree to both go to New York to seek fame and fortune . Along the way , they meet a bazillion crazy characters who wander into their basement apartment faster than is humanly possible . And , yes , I truly do mean wander into the apartment . It's like Grand Central Station in there and after a while the gimmick just doesn't make sense . Subtle it ain't ! MY SISTER EILEEN is a screwball comedy that is very , very aware that that is exactly what it should be . While often cute and enjoyable , all too often the film seems to think that by being too loud , too chaotic and too goofy , it will be a successful film . Personally , I enjoyed it but wish they'd perhaps slowed the whole thing down and tried for at least some subtlety and style . It made the pacing of ARSENIC AND OLD LACE and BRINGING UP BABY seem absolutely slow by comparison ! ! Throughout this film , whenever the action seems to slow , the film makers seem to just randomly toss characters into the mix with the instructions " act kooky " - - sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't . As a result , it's a very hit or miss production . However , fortunately , the film ends on a very high note with a surprise ( and funny ) cameo appearance . I won't say more - - it might spoil the fun . Overall , it's a good time-passer and a decent film , but don't expect magic .
461064	2467618	313189	6.0	A decent Snub Pollard effort	In this film , Snub leaves his extremely tiny town to go live with his aunt , who he doesn't even know . He arrives at her house when she's throwing a party and she doesn't want to invite him inside . . . until she learns he owns an oil well . Then she encourages him to meet and become smitten with her daughter . However , Snub isn't that interested in this vamp and instead is interested in the maid . But due to their persistence , Snub finally agrees to marry the cousin - - at which point the maid hatches a plan to expose the ruse and a silent comedy chase ensues . This isn't a great comedy by any stretch of the imagination , but it does have a decent number of laughs as well as a few that fall very flat ( such as those involving the duck ) . While far from Pollard's best ( IT'S A GIFT ) , it still is watchable and cute . And , unfortunately , it's made worse by the ill-fitting music that was just slapped onto this short in the " Old Time Comedy Classics : Volume 9 " DVD . Like almost all their films , the appropriateness of the music seemed irrelevant to those who assembled this collection .
458460	2467618	190878	6.0	Very nice art but the message was a bit heavy-handed	This is a very well animated cartoon that was sponsored by the National Film Board of Canada . Like many of their animated films , this one was part of a series dedicated to illustrating the UN's commitment to human rights and I am sure this video was warmly embraced by all nations and generated world peace . . . for about 2 seconds ! Then , people went back to being jerks . The film is about conflict resolution and features two cute gophers . One accidentally kicks dirty on another one and soon they start fighting . Eventually , however , they learn together and all is well . . . until a cute ending . As for me , I would have preferred to watch Mack and Tosh - - the Warner Brothers gopher twins . As you may have guessed from my comment above , working out problems peacefully is wonderful - - too bad the UN rarely has anything to do with it ! On top of my cynicism , the film also comes off as a tad heavy-handed and I really wish it didn't .
462163	2467618	71519	6.0	Some interesting new twists , but overall undone by cheap-o touches as well	This is the 379th Frankenstein film done by Hammer Films - - or so it seems . This British studio made tons of Frankenstein and Dracula films that are indeed entertaining , but they also tended to dilute the quality of the films after a while because they made so darn many and the plots were just too similar . I mean - - how many times can you see the twisted Doctor creating yet another monster that ultimately will run amok ? ! Fortunately , there are enough new angles to make this final film of the series worth watching , but unfortunately the film is also undone by some very , very shoddy makeup work ! The film begins with a handsome young doctor buying corpses from a local scoundrel . When the grave robber is caught , the doctor is implicated and sentenced to an institution for the criminally insane . Once there , the doctor soon learns that the " nice doctor " who works at the institution is actually the Baron Frankenstein using an alias . Naturally , Frankenstein is happy to have an eager young apprentice to help him with his patients and his " other work " . Not surprisingly , the other work involves piecing together bits and pieces of the dead to create a creature ( wow , I didn't see THAT coming ! ! ) . Now up until this point , I enjoyed the film quite a bit - - the film had some nice plot twists that kept my attention . However , as for the so-called " creature " , it was ridiculous ! It looked almost like a chimpanzee and a caveman put together - - all covered in hair and with features that looked nothing like any Frankenstein monster I've ever seen ! To make it worse , the latex mask they used for the monster is so thick and ungainly that when it later talks , you can't even see the jaws or mouth move ! And as for the body , it's obviously a rubber suit - - you can tell in some scenes where he's poked and the " doughy " aspects of the suit are apparent ! ! As for the brain removal scenes , they were decent provided you really don't know what a brain should look like . Important bits like the color of the brain and the absence of the outer covering ( meninges ) are wrong but most won't notice . However , overall it looked like the special effects / makeup budget was about $48 . 39 - - not a particularly distinguished Hammer special effects effort I must say ! Now as for the acting , it was just fine . Peter Cushing was his typical Doctor Frankenstein and this isn't surprising considering how many times he played him . According to IMDb , Cushing hated his wig , but I thought it made him look cute ( though perhaps like Helen Hayes , like Cushing said ) ! The rest of the cast are just fine , though it seems his two assistants were both thrown in for their " eye candy " value as well as their acting . The young lady was ravishing and the other doctor was amazingly pretty . I'm straight but I was clearly impressed by Shane Briant as the doc ! But , if you look at Briant's IMDb pictures , they don't do him justice ( particularly the one that is all wormy ) . So , overall , despite some nice changes ( such as setting the film in a mental institution ) , the film is pretty much the standard formula . Plus , despite a decent script , the monster's death is unnecessarily gross and stupid - - like they were running out of film and just tossed in a cheesy ending . A definitely worthwhile for fans of Hammer films , but otherwise , try watching the earlier Hammer films instead - - this tepid one might convince you ( incorrectly ) that the studio was second-rate . One final note : Oddly , the movie was rated R . I saw the DVD and assumed this was the entire film - - yet there was no cursing , no nudity and the gore wasn't all that bad , even for 1974 . It's inexplicable how it got such a rating and I would have no trouble letting older kids see it . The only adult things in the plot involved a subplot about incest , but it wasn't really described or shown in any way .
459239	2467618	51605	6.0	A very interesting curio	Dana Andrews was taken prisoner during the Korean War and finally arrives home after being away for many years . But now he has periodic dizzy spells as a result of his brutal captivity . When he goes to Washington to meet his old business partner at a public relations office , he learns that his partner is dead and the business was sold out from under him to a guy that is obviously a jerk . After storming out of the office , Andrews meets with an old friend , a Senator , and learns that his old firm is doing a lot to distort truth and influence opinion - - as they are a probable front group . Oddly , they never say " communist " , but it's obvious that's what they intend . So , in order to expose this evil plot , Andrews returns and makes nice with the jerk and joins the firm . Generally , it's a pretty good curio of the time and it is one of the few chances you'll get to see Mel Tormé in an important role ( though , oddly , he gets very low billing despite all his screen time ) . As always Andrews is very good , but towards the very end of the film the writers make a bad gaff - - making the otherwise decent film really clichéd . This is when Andrews catches the baddies and is holding a gun on them . Just then , of all times , he gets a blinding headache and drops his gun ! ! ! Come off it , this is just ridiculous and sets up an unnecessary final chase scene . Also , it's rather funny that the things the firm is doing to illegitimately influence public opinion and Congress are EXACTLY the same things many organizations do regularly today ! ! One example in the film is how they ask loaded questions that make it appear the public feels one way when they don't - - something we see on news shows all the time today ! Overall , it's not a great film but interesting enough to make it a little better than just a time passer , though fans of Andrews ( like me ) will probably enjoy it .
463327	2467618	71636	6.0	While very interesting artistically , it didn't do much for me	This is a fascinating film - - not so much for what it says but because it looks so very , very early 1970s . When I watched it , it brought back memories of super-wide neckties , crazy hair and intense colors . I also liked the quality of the animation - - though it was , at times , hard on the eyes . The way things seemed to morph in the film was pretty interesting . However , while there were some interesting elements , the film got old very , very quickly . It was so hard on the eyes and other senses that it was tough watching it to the conclusion . I can see that all the other reviews have been extremely positive and I'm glad they liked it . However , I truly can't see the average person sitting through this film - - it's definitely for a very select audience .
460470	2467618	949826	6.0	Very interesting . . . too bad the films made during this era just weren't that good	Between 1941 and 1945 , Laurel and Hardy made six rather mediocre films for Fox studios . These six films as well as another film for MGM and RKO were all sub-par - - mostly because these studios didn't have the same special touch for making Laurel and Hardy films that Hal Roach Studios had . The boys were there , but the films themselves were very much unlike their earlier efforts . Some of this no doubt was due to their advancing age as well as the repetitive nature of the films , but most of the problem seemed due to a real ambivalence by these larger studios for the team . Instead of allowing them creative control and asking for their input , they were simply handed scripts by hacks and were expected to follow them exactly and with no improvisation . That was just nuts , but the powers that be demanded it . However , despite all these deficiencies , this documentary that was prepared for the DVD release of the six Fox films seems to indicate that these films were STILL Hollywood gold . While I have recently seen all six and agree they aren't collectively as bad as some books on the team have asserted , they certainly weren't much better than genial time-passers . The best of them , JITTERBUGS and THE BULLFIGHTERS were perhaps a bit better and the worst , THE BIG NOISE , was like a giant migraine - - certainly not the great films the documentary claims . However , when not shamelessly promoting these mediocre films , the documentary gave some very nice insight into the team outside of the camera - - particularly regarding Stanley . The final portion about some kids who often visited with the genial Mr . Laurel was really touching and actually made the whole thing worth while . While Stan's personal life had problems ( several failed marriages ) , it was nice to hear what a sweet fellow he was to ordinary fans .
458644	2467618	35855	6.0	The series is sliding towards mediocrity	The Falcon is approached by a college girl at the beginning of the film . A professor died recently and she knows it's a murder even though they say it was a natural death . Before he has a chance to investigate , the impulsive and annoying girl steals his car - - forcing him to go to the school to retrieve it ( and thus get pulled into the investigation ) . As the film unfolds in a rather unremarkable and far-fetched plot , we meet a set of characters who all could have killed the professor - - who , it turns out , did NOT die due to natural causes . When one of the suspects is then clearly murdered , the police become involved as well - - and as usual , they are about as much help as a pilot's license to a fish ! In the end , through some spurious reasoning , the Falcon figures out the murderer - - leading to a very cool scene at the edge of a cliff . While this is not a bad detective film , it did seem that since the earlier Falcon films ( with George Sanders , actor Tom Conway's real-life brother ) that the series went into a bit of a decline . Part of it might be because I miss Sanders in the lead role , though Conway looks and especially sounds so much like him I doubt this is the main reason . I think the problem is that the original formula is gone . There is no great sidekick ( such as Allen Jenkins ) , no fiancée and no glib remarks by the Falcon . In fact , it's the glibness that I think sets the earlier films apart from the later ones , as the earlier films had lots of wonderful lines - - full of sarcasm and zip . This was especially noticeable since I had watched Sanders ' second Falcon film and then this one just a few hours later . Still , despite its deficiencies , it is a worthwhile B-detective series film - - just don't expect any spark to set it apart from the many rival series at the other studios . By the way , the psychology professor says of himself " I am a medical doctor and a psychologist " . Actually , if he were an MD , then this would make him a psychiatrist - - a distinction that should have been noted by the script writer . Psychiatrists don't like to be referred to as psychologists and vice-versa , plus their jobs are often quite different ( psychiatrists generally use medication to treat mental illnesses , psychologists cannot legally do this and use counseling to treat problems ) . Oh , and one last thing . While the Falcon was sorely missing his usual sidekick and flustered fiancée , I did like the three young triplets . They were pretty amusing in a " huey , Dewey and Louie " sort of way , plus their brief song was a nice and enjoyable piece - - certainly much more so than the other needless songs placed into the film . Competent overall but still somewhat lacking . Perhaps this was due to their being three Falcon films in 1943 and three more in 1944 , and so with all these films a bit less care was being taken in production .
461237	2467618	1660	6.0	Pretty good for 1911 , but otherwise it's a reasonably forgettable film	This film will most likely NOT change you into a fan of early films or the once-famous actor , John Bunny , who stars in this film . However , when the film was made , it was a pretty good picture and his fans loved it . Nowadays , you might be bored by the overly simple plot , but for 1911 it was actually pretty good in this regard also - - with some slapstick humor and an " evil stepmother " theme that was pretty popular in its day . Mr . Bunny ( he's not a rabbit - - that's his real name ) is a rich widower who has an obnoxious little daughter who he dotes over continually . However , he is advised my his aunt that the child needs more discipline in the form of a strict governess . He agrees and is sexually fixated on the nasty governess ' hair - - so much so that he not only ignores how mean she is but asks her to marry him ! This plot line isn't very believable and when seen today , this is a bit hard to take . However , the marriage is averted when a housekeeper takes action - - convincing the brat to cut off the nasty governess ' hair while she is sleeping . Since Mr . Bunny only loved the lady for her hair , the wedding is off and the man and child live happily ever after ! A strange plot , I know , but a lot of fun to watch - - especially when the hair is whacked off and the old battle-axe is left with nothing to recommend her .
460912	2467618	51773	6.0	While clever , it's hard to really like Grant or Bergman in this film	This film was a pretty big risk for Ingrid Bergman to take . About a decade earlier , her very public affair with Roberto Rossellini temporarily damaged her career . Because of this , it seems pretty surprising that in this film she'd play a woman who knowingly has an affair with a supposedly married man . Oddly , however , despite this being an affair , the film seems to imply that they never get around to actually committing adultery ! They spend lots of time together and whisper sweet nothings to each other , but their relationship seems sex-less ! I'm sure this would have been handled very differently if it were made today . As for the rest of the film , it tries very hard to be a romance - - with excellent music and cinematography to set the mood . The problem is for me , adultery ( or " near-adultry " like in this film ) is a MAJOR turnoff ! You can't get past the fact that Ingrid and Cary seem like very selfish people . Later , however , in a very , very bizarre plot twist , you find out that there is a lot more to the affair than meets the eye . What exactly this is and how the film then becomes a bit more of a romantic-comedy is just something you'll have to see for yourself . The bottom line is that this is a pretty agreeable time-passer but also NOT one of the stars ' better films . Call me old fashioned ( which I am ) , but selfish and slutty appearing behavior is not compatible with romance .
462733	2467618	33190	6.0	Mildly amusing but could have been a lot better	This is a low-budget Hal Roach short feature film ( at only about an hour in length ) . In the mid to late 1930s into the 40s , producer Roach began to make less and less shorts ( 15 to 20 minutes ) and began to make feature-length films averaging only about 60 minutes . Except for the TOPPER series , most of these films seemed to be only modestly successful and none of them were good enough to make up for the defection of Roach's # 1 stars - - Laurel and Hardy . TURNABOUT has a wonderful idea for a plot , though it sure wasn't handled very well at times . It's a fantasy about arguing spouses who are given the opportunity to change bodies to see what life would be like from the other point of view . In a funny scene , the couple's statue ( called " Mr . Ram " ) comes to life to say he's had enough and is tired of hearing them bicker - - hence his telling them he can do the transformation . Considering he IS a talking statue , they believe him and the results are pretty funny . The problem is that the humor in th film just isn't sustained very well - - there are too many sluggish sections and too many places where the laughs seem very corny and forced . Plus , the very best part of the film where the change occurs doesn't even come until about half-way through the movie ! With a small re-write to pick up the pace and having the transference occur much sooner could have really helped this film . Fortunately , though , the film is unique enough and has enough bright moments that it is still worth viewing - - especially if you wait until the very end - - which is VERY funny to say the least ! ! PS - - While a funny joke , there is a very off-color joke about the KKK in the film ! Given the era , this is more understandable but is one of the few times the Klan is mentioned in film ever and it also is pretty insensitive .
459999	2467618	19735	6.0	Ronald Colman is great - - the movie , though , is quite stagy	One of the big reasons I sought out this film was because it starred Ronald Colman . With only a very few exceptions , his films were terribly entertaining and he was a classy actor . In this film , his acting , as always , is great . The problem is that the film as a whole is pretty forgettable . First the good . Apart from his acting , the other actors are generally good ( though his friend " Algy " is played poorly - - just too dopey and pointless a characterization ) . And , for a sound movie from 1929 , the sound quality is great . Of course it won't match films in sound quality made just a few years later , but it's obvious this was no silent movie with sound later tacked on - - which is so typical of Hollywood films of the late 20s ( and French films well into the 1930s ) . Characters moved about and even had their backs to the camera with no sound problems . Now the not so good . It is obvious that this was first a play , as the plot and pacing is very stagy and stilted . AND , the movie kept going on and on and on . The film would have best been completed in about 60 or 70 minutes , but to continue the movie they kept having the characters do really dumb things - - I mean too stupid to make any sense at all . An Example was escaping from the evil gang and instead of going to the police or running to a hidden location , they went back to the inn where the film began and just assumed the gang wouldn't think to look for them there ! Well , they DID find them and the movie continued on and on from there . It's a shame really , because with a tighter script this would have been a terrific film .
463031	2467618	89755	6.0	mediocre eye candy	This movie should not have won the Oscar for Best Picture . The fact that it did was either because it was a very bad year for movies ( in which case , I don't think an award should be given for this category ) or the academy , once again , voted for a bloated MEGA-picture despite it being sterile ( there are MANY worse examples of this - - think of The English Patient or The Last Emporer ) . While I don't think it was even close to Oscar material , I also think a few reviews on this site are too harsh as well . Giving this picture a " 1 " ? Nope . This isn't fair , as the music and photography were great . I loved the African singing and the scene of the biplane flying over the flock of flamingos in incredible . So , the final verdict : dull and unlikeable characters , a script that reads like fiction ( not the real life story ) , unconvincing dialog BUT a treat for the eyes and ears . So my advice is to turn off your brain and enjoy - - particularly on the big screen .
463041	2467618	104652	7.0	a good film that just ends abruptly	This is a beautiful film and I longed for its domestic release . Unfortately , I felt very disappointed at how the movie just abruptly ended . It looked as if they were on some sort of deadline and since they were running behind , they just ended the film ! It's a real shame , as up until the ending , the movie was great - - exceptional animation and direction throughout ! I've seen many Miyazaki films and this was the first that disappointed me ( though , I must admit when I saw Nausicaa I was even more disappointed ) . Instead , try watching Kiki's Delivery Service , My Neighbor Totoro , Spirited Away , Princess Mononoke or Castle in the Sky - - all are much more complete and satisfying Miyazaki films .
459062	2467618	87003	7.0	a slight film with some charm	While this isn't among Woody Allen's best , I was thrilled when I saw it because , in some ways , it was a welcome departure from his overly self-analytical and self-indulgent films . In other words , the film was made simply to entertain and I liked that . While not as crazy and goofy as his earliest films , it's a cute little film where he plays a nice but hopeless talent agent that represents the weirdest and worst talent imaginable ! Well , he somehow gets mixed up with the mob and most of the movie is spent watching him nearly getting killed again and again . Mia Farrow plays a very unusual role as the gangster gal - - quite a departure from her usual roles . It's worth seeing but not especially memorable .
459937	2467618	51542	7.0	Why did it take four years to release this film ? It was excellent and very watchable .	This is a deceptive little film . First off , because it was made and sat for four years before release , you might be inclined to think it is a dud - - but that's far from true . The film is very good - - good enough to almost earn an 8 . Second , while the film has some horrific scenes and features Boris Karloff and Christopher Lee , it is not a horror film but more of a drama . So if you see it , don't expect monsters or madness - - instead , there are just bad people and good people doing bad things . The film is set in 1840 and Karloff plays an exceptionally skilled surgeon who is dismayed that there are no drugs to alleviate the suffering of patients during surgery . Basically , people were wide awake and felt EVERYTHING during surgery and amputations ! This is true , as the first anesthesias didn't come about until around 1850 . Despite his concerns , other doctors didn't share his enthusiasm for change , so Karloff foolishly begins experimenting on himself - - inhaling a mixture of various chemicals ( including opium ) . Not surprisingly , he becomes addicted and this once sweet man becomes an unwilling pawn in the seedy underworld . The film gets very high marks for construction , writing , direction and the performance of Karloff . There isn't much I'd change about the film , though fans of Christopher Lee might be disappointed that his role isn't that big and his character isn't that interesting ( despite the fact he's a cold-blooded murderer ) . Give this intelligent little film a watch - - it's really very good .
460997	2467618	16643	7.0	first half is pretty dull and the second half is great fun	This WWI comedy stars Charlie Chaplin's half-brother , Syd . Physically , he doesn't look much like him , but with his bushy mustache looks highly reminiscent of the Keystone comedian , Chester Conklin . The first half of the film is very mundane and frankly it bored me . Nothing particularly funny occurred and the plot just seemed stuck . About the only thing that happened was the corporal making life miserable for Syd and his underlings because he was just a power-hungry jerk . Fortunately , towards the middle , it abruptly became extremely funny and I found myself laughing out loud . In fact , my wife came in the room and after a moment or two , she was laughing as well ! So , let's skip talking about the first half except to say that Chaplin in a career private and dislikes his jerk of a corporal , played by Edgar Kennedy . When the movie switches to the show being put on for the troops , it picks up greatly . Seeing one of the guys in drag was cute , and Syd and his buddy dressed in an amazingly articulated horse suit provided a lot of laughs . Unfortunately , the Germans attack during the show and the British troops scatter - - leaving Syd and his buddy stuck in the horse costume and unable to get out in time ! So , they continue to pretend they are a horse . Now this sounds stupid but was made believable because by the time they were discovered , the Germans who saw them were quite drunk ! And it was pretty cute seeing them try to escape - - especially when the horse head fell off and Syd's dog jumped into the costume ( a horse with a dog's head is definitely memorable ) . Later , once they are out of the suit , they attack a couple Germans and steal their uniforms . They then discover the German's plan to evacuate the town for the British and leave it booby-trapped to blow up ! They also discover that one of the British officers is a German spy . Well , Syd rises to the occasion and the day is miraculously saved . The General is so thrilled that he offers to give Syd ANYTHING he wants , so Syd asks to become a sergeant so he can pay back Edgar Kennedy for all the awful things he did to him in the first part of the film ! The film gets high marks for being entertaining and original . It is a FAR , FAR better film than Buster Keaton's WWI film , DOUGHBOYS and a little better than Laurel and Hardy's PACK UP YOUR TROUBLES ( good film but too much sentimentality ) . PS - - Watch the scene just before Syd dons the horse suit . Watching him packing up chairs is amazing - - such a seemingly mundane task done in such a swift and amazing way .
464571	2467618	452139	7.0	Very strange and unique - - but rewarding and worth seeing	AUSREISSER is a very odd little German film . It begins with a rather ordinary man getting ready to go to a job interview . However , out of the blue , a small boy ( Yuri ) arrives and asks him to drive him to school . He doesn't know Yuri , but the boy insists that his mother wanted the man to do this and after a while , he relents and takes the child to school . Later , after dropping him off , he realizes the boy left his backpack behind , so he goes to the school looking for the kid . He can't find him there , but instead finds him wandering by a skating rink in the park . The boy insists that the man is his father and he needs to take care of him . Since they can't locate the mother , the man reluctantly agrees to take the boy home to sleep . Where the film went next was very odd and unexpected , but rather rewarding . What I particularly liked was the unconventional nature of the film - - it certainly WASN'T the usual sort of film you'd see ! Interesting , somewhat heartwarming and clever , I can see why this film was nominated for an Oscar in the category of Best Live Action Short Film .
463991	2467618	36824	7.0	Another excellent Wayne wartime propaganda piece	Saying this film is " propaganda " is not an insult . No , it was deliberately crafted to encourage Americans that we can and will win the war if we stand firm . And what better image of this than the ever-vigilant John Wayne - - the embodiment of the Hollywood image of heroism . This film reminds me a lot of The Flying Tigers , though the plot isn't so melodramatic . It's about a crew of civilian engineers sent overseas to do construction for our troops ( such as building runways and other projects ) . BUT , the evil Japanese in the movie take advantage of the fact that these are unarmed civilians and butcher them at every opportunity . So , what is The Duke and his trusted pals to do ? Take up arms and use their own equipment when necessary to beat the stuffing out of the Japs ! Yes , guys with bulldozers and clubs NEVER could have inflicted the casualties you witness in the movie , but man if it isn't entertaining to watch - - particularly the explosive ending .
460793	2467618	36515	7.0	very good but a bit dated and tedious at times	I think this movie was probably a lot more powerful when it first debuted in 1943 , though nowadays it seems a bit too preachy and static to elevate it to greatness . The film is set in 1940 - - just before the entry of the US into the war . Paul Lukas plays the very earnest and decent head of his family . He's a German who has spent seven years fighting the Nazis and avoiding capture . Bette Davis is his very understanding and long-suffering wife who has managed to educate and raise the children without him from time to time . As the film begins , they are crossing the border from Mexico to the USA and for the first time in years , they are going to relax and stop running . The problem for me was that the family was too perfect and too decent - - making them seem like obvious positive propaganda instead of a real family suffering through real problems . While this had a very noble goal at the time , it just seems phony today . In particular , the incredibly odd and extremely scripted dialog used by the children just didn't ring true . It sounded more like anti-Fascism speeches than the voices of real children . They were as a result extremely annoying - - particularly the littlest one who came off , at times , as a brat . About the only ones who sounded real were Bette Davis and her extended American family as well as the scumbag Romanian living with them ( though he had no discernible accent ) . It's really tough to believe that the ultra-famous Dashiel Hammett wrote this dialog , as it just doesn't sound true to life . The story was based on the play by his lover , Lillian Hellman . And , the basic story idea and plot is good , . . . but the dialog is just bad at times . Overall , an interesting curio and a film with some excellent moments , . . . but that's really about all .
462605	2467618	36376	7.0	not nearly as good as the original , but still worth seeing	The story behind this film must be very interesting . For some odd reason , the studio decided to do a sequel to Dracula ( 1931 ) but have a different person play the count AND make everyone think it's Dracula's son , when it's really the old vampire himself ! ! While this " surprise twist " is hardly a surprise at all to those who watch the movie ( especially since the character is named " Count Alucard " - - " Alucard " is " Dracula " spelled backwards - - what an amazingly clever ruse - - NOT ) , the movie itself is still chilling and lots of fun . While Universal horror lovers like myself find this whole movie to be a step down for the franchise , it's still a decent film that's worth your time .
460966	2467618	102975	7.0	This one kind of got lost among the many Trek films	This Star Trek film is one of the more difficult ones to remember in my mind after I saw it . I thought it was okay , but that was really about it . Then I saw it again a few years later and I realized it was actually a good film but just feel it gets lost in the mind of many fans because it is the last in the series to star all the original cast and has a different tempo . This film more than most focuses on " the big three " - - Spock , McCoy and Shatner . The film begins with an appeal from the Klingons for help - - it seems their planet is doomed and for the first time they want an alliance with the Federation . Kirk's solution is simple - - they are Klingons so let them die ! ! But , despite this view , the meeting where they sign the accord is going to happen anyway . At the historic meeting , there is an assassination and Kirk and McCoy are convicted for the murder . Well you KNOW that they didn't do it , but the real culprets must be found . This mystery-suspense aspect of the film makes it pretty interesting and at least different . Not a great film but a worthy addition to the series .
461081	2467618	19670	7.0	While far from their best , this silent Laurel and Hardy short is well worth a look	Laurel and Hardy are collection agents sent to both serve Edgar Kennedy with a court order as well as repossess Kennedy's radio - - since he apparently hadn't made any payments since 1921 ! However , when they try to give Kennedy the court papers , he's very slippery and doesn't give in very easily . BACON GRABBERS is a decent Laurel and Hardy short , though far from the team's best . The reason it isn't top-notch isn't because it's a silent short , as some of their very best films ( in particular , BIG BUSINESS ) were silents . I think the problem , and it's a minor one , is that the film is a bit slow and doesn't pack in quite the same number of laughs as most of their other films . But , even a lesser Laurel and Hardy short is STILL a thing of beauty , so I do recommend you give it a watch - - even if the ending is awfully contrived ( after all , a steam roller doesn't just come along and do what this one does ! ) . Ironically , just five years later , Edgar Kennedy himself plays a man trying unsuccessfully to serve a court summons in the film WE'RE RICH AGAIN . I guess the tables are turned !
461096	2467618	32828	7.0	has some excellent moments	Parts of this movie are great - - particularly those with WC Fields . In particular , I liked the horrible and cowardly way that he dealt with the attack on the train - - pushing hapless little kids with cap guns out the door to face the onslaught ! But , you'll no doubt discover that although this is a WC Fields and Mae West film , they don't interact much together , as they apparently hated each other and had to often be filmed separately . Mae's moments are generally flat compared to Fields ' as she once again plays the trampy old broad who every man MUST possess ( god only knows why ) . While the film certainly has some excellent moments , there are better films by Fields you can watch ( such as IT'S A GIFT , THE BANK DICK , etc . ) . As for West , this is probably a better than average effort from her as at least her character is slightly different than her usual 1930s fare .
462689	2467618	32820	7.0	A nice conclusion to the four Secret Service films	Starting with SECRET SERVICE OF THE AIR ( 1938 ) , Ronald Reagan made four B-movie series film with the character of " Brass Bancroft " . I have seen all but SMASHING THE MONEY RING . The first film , despite its very low budget and modest pretense , was an exceptional film for the genre . The second , CODE OF THE SECRET SERVICE was just awful - - with an extremely poorly written script that wasn't worthy of the franchise . This final film , MURDER IN THE AIR , isn't quite as good as the first film but it sure comes close - - making a nice conclusion to this series . Reagan is given a special assignment to infiltrate a mob of spies who are seeking to destroy American . Oddly , like in his other films , the exact countries involved never are alluded to , though in this one Communists are mentioned . These evil rats have a big plan , but Reagan and the rest of his fellow agents have no idea what it will be . Fortunately , one of the spies is accidentally killed and Reagan assumes his identity . I'd rather not discuss exactly what happens next , as it might spoil the surprise , but I was excited to see that the film was set partially on board a US Navy dirigible and the scene involving it crashing was pretty exciting . All in all , this is not a film that you'll long remember - - it's a B-film through and through . But for a B , it's an excellent one and stand above the crowd of many B series films .
459711	2467618	52579	8.0	Excellent and beautiful , . . . but all too familiar	While I love Japanese versions of Western stories ( such as Kurosawa's version of Macbeth - - THRONE OF BLOOD ) , I guess I've just never been the biggest fan of the story of Cyrano . I have seen the José Ferrer and Gérard Depardieu versions and this film is at least as good - - perhaps a little better due to its wonderful sense of artistry and the acting of Toshiro Mifune ( though the other two did great jobs as well ) . The cinematography is exquisite and the poetic nature of the dialog is wonderful as well . But , because I knew exactly how the story would go , there was no suspense and this prevented the movie from receiving a higher score . THRONE OF BLOOD did receive a higher score because it was so unique in how it approached the material that it was almost a completely different story , but this one never veered far enough off course to make it more watchable . Excellent , but familiar .
458138	2467618	140888	8.0	not much fun to watch but a good film	Is this film fun to watch ? Generally NO . BUT , I still appreciated the fine acting and the film's refusal to give into cheap sentimentality . The main character is a realistic portrait of a woman with a heart of aluminum at best ( certainly not GOLD ) . She is generally uncaring a self-serving but over time she grows a little - - if you expect much , then boy are you in for a disappointment . And , considering how this violates the clichés associated with this type of film , I was thrilled . In many ways this film was a Brazilian version of the Japanese film Kikujirô no natsu ( or vice-versa ) in that both main characters are terribly flawed and try to help a lost child . FYI - - Central Station appeared a year before Kitano's film , Kikujirô no natsu .
464409	2467618	17525	8.0	super silly fun	This is a totally silly silent comedy . Is it sophisticated or cerebral ? NO WAY ! ! But , despite being just totally silly , it made me laugh repeatedly and my wife kept laughing at me because I couldn't stop laughing at the antics of Andy Clyde and Billy Bevan . The film starts with the duo complaining because they are hungry and have no money . They try a variety of ways to steal a meal , but keep getting caught . Billy sees a cop walking his beat and taking a few liberties along the way - - taking some " free " fruit from a local grocer . Billy reasons that if he has a police uniform , free food would naturally come his way . Andy wants to get in on the act and jumps in a baby carriage that Billy pushes along his supposed beat . When they enter a restaurant , Billy just assumes he can eat whatever he wants for free . Andy's solution is to cover himself up completely with a blanket and keep reaching around stealing other diners ' food . I particularly liked when Andy started smoking under the blanket and customers were shocked to see that the " baby " was a smoker ! It is interesting to note that the movie was directed by Del Lord . Lord later directed many of the Three Stooges shorts and you can see some of the Stooges ' bits here being done a decade earlier by different people ( so apparently they weren't Stooge bits after all ) . In particular , the oyster soup with the oyster that is very alive and very annoying - - Curly Howard did this same bit at least three or four times on film . All-in-all , a very silly and unbelievable film that is just plain funny . And if you are the type of person that can laugh at silly and stupid things , then this movie is for you !
461954	2467618	17414	8.0	A pretty good and rather long short comedy	This is a Harry Langdon short film made for Mack Sennett and is included with the " Harry Langdon : Lost and Found " four DVD set . During most of the 1920s , Harry Langdon made two-reel shorts that were about 20 minutes in length . However , this film is over thirty - - making it a long short film . Because of the length , he was able to create a more detailed and almost full-length style film . The first portion is probably the best as you see that Harry is the only soldier in WWI who has no idea that the war had ended ! When a farmer is using dynamite to blow up old stumps , Harry thinks the German army is after him . I really liked the scene where Harry thought the cow had been blown apart - - it was very original . I really wish more time had been spent on this , as I found myself laughing quite a bit . Eventually , his travels take him to a far-off European land where the worthless King Strudel is about to be kidnapped . But , like the story of " The Prisoner of Zenda " , Harry is the spitting image of the king and the king's # 1 man decides to have Harry pose as the monarch . The problem is that everyone seems to hate the king and the queen is even plotting to kill the guy . How Harry resolves all this is pretty cute . While not great , this is a very good and polished silent comedy - - and among Langdon's best .
460008	2467618	300	8.0	How do you rate a film this short ?	This is one of the very earliest attempts at producing an animated short , having been produced in 1900 . And just how can I accurately rate this film as it only lasts about 1 minute ? Well , it's just guesswork and considering the context for when it was made , it's an amazing film and still watchable today . A man walks in front of an easel . He draws a face as well as a bottle of wine and a glass . Then very seamlessly , he takes the wine bottle and glass off the paper and they become real and he drinks it . The face on the paper looks sad until he gives it a taste of the wine and a cigar - - then the face becomes very happy . The artist is live and the drawings he makes seem magical and well-integrated into the film .
462993	2467618	358	8.0	Not especially great until the final wonderful scene !	This film is highly reminiscent of the Edison film " Execution of Czolgosz " - - a recreation of the execution of the man that murdered President McKinley . The Czolgosz execution was re-staged and many people believed it was the real thing , though today's audiences would easily be able to figure out it was faked . This is much like this French film from the exact same year . In fact , it was not uncommon for companies to " borrow " ideas from other ones and I'm not sure which of the studios ( Edison or Pathe ) really made their film first . The first portion of the movie is a relatively dull story about a guy who murders another , is apprehended and sent to prison . While there are real sets and plot ( making it better than MOST films from 1901 ) , the thing looks pretty cheesy . That is , until the very end . Then , to my utter surprise and initial horror , they do a pretty realistic guillotining of the prisoner and you see the head pop off ! ! If your kids want to see a very , very old film , show them this one - - it's creepy but cool and guaranteed to make them laugh !
462195	2467618	17729	8.0	This really is NOT a Laurel and Hardy film - - and in some ways that's not a bad thing	Despite this Hal Roach short being in a collection of Laurel and Hardy films , it's not really one of the boys ' films . Instead , they are tiny bit players along with some other famous Roach stars ( such as James Finlayson and Charley Chase ) who play lunatics in only a few very brief scenes . The real star is Max Davidson who plays his very funny " Papa Gimplewart " character - - a man he played in three films for Roach . I've seen two of them ( this film and Jewish PRUDENCE ) and they were very , very funny comedies - - at least as funny or perhaps funnier than the average silent Laurel and Hardy film . Sadly , however , today he's pretty much forgotten and his Jewish ethnic humor probably would be seen as politically incorrect as well - - even though it's very funny . The film begins with the Gimplewart family trying to sell their home . That's because they live next to a bunch of lunatics who really ham it up in the film . You're not sure if they live in some asylum or perhaps the crazies are just roommates - - either way , they're driving the Gimplewarts crazy ! Because of this , Papa quickly accepts the first offer he gets without even questioning why the guy wanted to trade houses sight unseen ! Well , when the Gimplewarts arrive to inspect their lovely new home , you soon see why it was such a " bargain " - - and much of the next 10 minutes is made up of some very imaginative and clever gags . You just have to see the home to believe it . To top it all off , the film ends on a very funny note . The bottom line is that this film has aged very well and is still very enjoyable today . Plus , it's a rare chance to see Max Davidson in all his glory . In fact , when you see this film , you'll probably see more of his than you'd expected . FYI - - Since the last Gimplewart film , Papa seems to have lost or misplaced two of his kids , as here in CALL OF THE CUCKOO he seems to only have two while in Jewish PRUDENCE he had three !
460223	2467618	105311	8.0	Probably the second best animated short of the year	If it hadn't been for MONA LISA DESCENDING THE STAIRS , there's a very strong chance that THE SANDMAN would have won the Oscar for Best Animated Short Film - - it was that striking and groundbreaking . Paul Berry created a stop motion world very similar to his later projects such as THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas and JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH . While the animation is not quite as fluid here in this early film , you can clearly see that it led to these very successful Disney films . Sadly , Barry died at age 40 and his output was quite limited . So what did I like about this film ? Well , the character designs were amazing and the sets had a strange and twisted quality that was both charming and creepy . As for the story , I am probably in the minority here , it was really good up until the surprise ending . I thought it was too creepy and disturbing and knocked the film from a 9 to an 8 - - this is certainly NOT a film to show to young and impressionable kids . Of course , for an older crowd , they'll probably love the sick finale . Watch it and see for yourself . This is an exceptional and brilliant film .
463768	2467618	53064	8.0	one of the only Speedy Gonzales cartoons worth watching	Apart from a few early Speedy Gonzales shorts , the rest were very pitiful and annoying . In fact , in the 1960s , they actually paired Speedy with Daffy Duck in some shorts that made absolutely no sense ( why would a duck hunt a mouse ? ) and were perhaps the worst cartoons Warner Brothers made . Despite all this , this is still a very good cartoon - - probably the best Speedy Gonzales cartoon of them all . Two stupid cats try again and again to catch Speedy and they end up getting the stuffing knocked out of them by the rodent . Then , in a very funny conclusion , they given up on chasing Speedy Gonzales and one of them quickly chases after " Slowpoke Rodriquez " - - the slowest mouse in Mexico . But his friend begins yelling at him to stop , as he then explains that Slowpoke also carries a gun ! Well , unfortunately for the other cat , this warning comes a bit too late and you see a wonderful scene of a very lazy mouse carrying a huge smoking revolver !
464362	2467618	53085	8.0	an excellent mummy film - - about on-par with many of the Universal mummy flicks	In many ways , this film reminds me of the Universal Mummy films of the 1940s . It really can't be compared to the Boris Karloff film of 1932 , as this is THE best of the genre to date . Instead , it is more reminiscent of the 1940s Universal Mummy movies with only a few differences - - the primary one being that this was not a black & white film . The pacing , special effects and story line itself is what make it a very close copy of these earlier films - - plus , the creature dies the same way in this film as it did in the swamps of the Southern US like it did in one of the Universal film . And , while this means that new ground isn't broken in THE MUMMY ( 1959 ) , it certainly won't offend fans of the older films and is sure to entertain . While it isn't an Earth-shattering film , for old-fashioned horror films it is excellent .
461288	2467618	53198	8.0	very good but not great	I have seen this movie twice . The first time , I thought it was an okay picture . However , because it is such an important French New Wave film and because so much positive stuff has been written about it , I thought I'd give it another try . Well , it did improve some with the second watching - - particularly since I have also seen the rest of the " Antoine Doinel " films . But , was it " great " , . . . not really , though it still was a very very good film . There is very little negative about it other than the occasionally poor sound track . As many New Wave films are supposed to have a " home-made " quality about them , much of the time this wasn't a problem . But , there were times when the amateurish quality of the music was distracting . Also , a smaller complaint was the abrupt ending , though this is only a small complaint since the director returned to his alter-ego in follow-up films .
462527	2467618	948479	8.0	Super-depressing , but also very well made and worth seeing	This short film was just posted on IMDb for viewing in the US , though hopefully it will be available in other countries for online viewing in the near future . The film begins with a little girl ( Zoe ) and her two parents in their home . You aren't sure what's going on , but you get a strong sense of foreboding as the girl and her father get ready to go to the park . Mom looks either sick or depressed and when the two return home later , it wasn't too surprising what has occurred . However , despite this , it's an excellent and VERY emotionally draining film . What I liked ( despite the film being so hard to watch from an emotional standpoint ) was the realistic writing and especially the excellent acting by the father when they return home to find tragedy has struck . Enjoyable , no . But a very well done film by a talented group of people .
459195	2467618	36112	8.0	rather unusual wartime propaganda piece	This film was designed to bolster the war effort yet despite this , it sometimes portrays Germans in a softer light instead of the typical " maniac " of American and British wartime films . The film follows the career of an idealistic young officer that recently won the Victoria Cross ( the British equivalent to the Medal of Honor ) . He is shown as brash and daring and gets himself into trouble in 1902 Germany . However , in the process he befriends a German officer ( Walbrook ) and their stories periodically intertwine . The first few minutes of the movie I found to be rather slow and stuffy . The video itself was also a problem as it had so yellowed it was hard to tell at times that the movie was originally in Technicolor . But , apart from these things , try to bear with the film as it is both inspiring and yet very human and compelling .
458503	2467618	404032	8.0	Despite a couple poorly written performances , an excellent film that is NOT exploitational or even a horror film	I liked this movie a heck of a lot more than I thought I would , as I had little interest in seeing a horror film ( this just isn't a genre I enjoy most of the time ) . A lot of this was because the movie really wasn't a horror film per se , but a courtroom drama following the death of a supposedly possessed girl as well as a film that discusses the possibility of demonic possession - - though this is handled in a pretty ambiguous way and with no easy or pat answers . I could see people who say demonic possession can be explained away by natural phenomena AND those who believe in its existence both enjoying this interesting and thought-provoking film . It probably won't offend religious people nor will like likely offend others - - it's just a good film . It's even more interesting when you learn that the story is based on a real case , though artistic license was used in making this film ( just how much , I don't know ) . Despite an excellent script , excellent acting by the actress playing " Emily Rose " and a real creepy mood , there is one problem with the film and that is the acting by BOTH the prosecuting and defense attorney in the film . The prosecutor seemed too wooden , angry and unprofessional to be real and I truly doubt if his histrionics in the courtroom would have been tolerated by a sane judge . Likewise , the defense attorney , at times , seemed rather dumb and presented nearly as poor a case at the prosecutor . Plus , the average person probably could have done a better job than they did ! I really wonder if the writers ever consulted with real lawyers to find out how to create these roles - - they just were not believable and tended to detract from the rest of the film . Still , despite this serious complaint , this IS a good film - - though I really doubt if it's a good idea to let young kids see this due to the subject matter . Also , if you get a chance , see REQUIEM . This is a German-made version of the exact same case of Anneliese Michel - - the inspiration for both stories . Both are very good but have a much different focus .
459130	2467618	16884	8.0	Garbo cast as the ultimate evil temptress slut !	This is a very good silent film , though I had just watched two other Greta Garbo films the same day I saw this one that were incredibly similar to this one - - as she plays the vamp in all three ! They were all part of the same set by TCM . In hindsight , I really wish they had packaged three Garbo movies that were more dissimilar in plot - - as the movies all tended to run together . I can't blame Ms . Garbo for this general trend in many of her silent movies , as MGM definitely type-cast her despite her objections . In fact , she was so irritated by this theme that she went on strike to try to force the studio to give her different roles . But , considering that the public loved the films and they were all very successful , MGM wasn't about to mess with a tried-and-true formula . This film is a stand-out because Greta is so gosh-darn evil and conniving . She is , up until a stupid and unconvincing change of heart late in the film , a cold and heartless slut . And , this coldness and self-centeredness actually is about the best thing about this movie . She is initially seen as an apparently nice lady when she is ardently pursued by handsome John Gilbert ( Garbo's reported favorite co-star ) . When the totally innocent Gilbert is caught with her by her husband , the story really begins to unfold well . After killing her husband in a duel , Gilbert still loves Garbo and doesn't realize she orchestrated the affair and the death of her husband . Only after this soldier ( Gilbert ) is sent overseas for three years as punishment for his involvement in the killing is the real Garbo revealed - - as she then marries Gilbert's best friend ! ! Then , when Gilbert returns from the service , she wants to STILL take up where the two lovers had left off three years earlier ! ! ! What a horrid woman ! And , as a result of her lies and manipulations , she nearly has Gilbert and his longtime friend kill each other ! This all is great melodrama and for a lurid love story , the movie excels up until the very end . Unfortunately , the writing sags unexpectedly and Greta sees the errors of her ways and repents ! This is 100 % ridiculous and unbelievable - - an evil and manipulative person just doesn't change because their conscience suddenly bothers them ! ! ! After all , the point of the film is that DOESN'T have a conscience ! ! ! Despite this terrible plot twist , we are at least rewarded to a WONDERFUL scene where Greta runs across the ice to stop the duel between the friends - - it is just too cool when she falls through the ice to her death ! The end is both fitting and satisfying and this helps a lot to make up for the dumb " conversion scene " just before it . By the way , on the DVD there is an alternative ending . I saw them both and felt they were both just about equally good .
463373	2467618	51365	8.0	a Bergman film that's not depressing or about death !	I've seen a lot of Ingmar Bergman films and sometimes I don't want to see one of his films about death or mental illness . Well , starting in the 1960s to the 1980s , these were the main themes of his movies , but in some of his earlier films , these are not so pervasive - - such as the movies The Devil's Eye ( a comedy ) and The Magician ( " Ansiktet " ) . Because of this , they may be more approachable to the average viewer who would balk at the much more serious tone of such classics as Through a Glass Darkly ( deep depression ) , Persona ( mental illness ) , Autumn Sonata ( repressed anger and abandonment ) , The Seventh Seal ( death and the plague ) or Fanny and Alexander ( child abuse and emotional neglect ) . The story is about a traveling group of hoaxters who put on a show combining magic and " animal magnetism " ( i . e . , an early name given to hypnosis ) . When they arrive at a Swedish town , they are forced to come to an audience with the local official and his cronies who want to prove that the act is a fraud . Bergman really doesn't try to resolve this issue , but instead shows how the town officials are really rather petty and mean people . How this traveling group deftly survives this encounter is the main focus of the movie . I especially liked the portion of the movie about the autopsy . It sounds gross , but I thought it was actually kind of funny . One of the officials is a cold and rather nasty doctor who longs for a chance to do an autopsy on the hypnotist . He gets far more than he bargains for - - that's all I really want to say - - otherwise it might ruin the suspense . So , overall I liked the movie . It was not great but well acted and not the least bit depressing .
463987	2467618	281176	8.0	I'd put this in the top 10 of all the Icelandic movies I've seen , . . .	Actually , the above comment is VERY misleading , as this is perhaps the 3rd movie I have seen from Iceland . In fact , because we get so few Icelandic movies her in the US , I made it a point to give it a try , as I wanted something different . Overall , I liked this movie , as the acting was good and the plot took lots of little twists and turns . This movie is an excellent example of a film that is difficult to predict and has characters who are quirky but not one-dimensional cutouts . Freya is a worldly woman who is returning home to Iceland after the death of her husband . She moves in her extended family and from then on , the movie is seen , at times , from the eyes of her little cousin who resents having to share her home and bedroom with Freya . It's obvious early on that Freya isn't going to just blend in - - as she arrived with 7 trunks clothes - - all in the latest fashions . While she turns the heads of many men , the rich guy who initially shows her the most attention goes from hot to cold . It seems she is from a working class family and he is rich ( at least by Icelandic standards ) , so it appears that he drops her cold . Later , though , it seems that despite his family pressures to ignore her , he returns and marries her . Life with this rich guy at first seems great , though difficult due to his bitchy mother . Then , the relationship begins to sour and Freya moves back with her family . The weak husband begins drinking ( and whoring ) and begs and then threatens the pregnant Freya to return . The final time he approaches her he is particularly violent and the scene is literally MISSING . I like that touch because you aren't sure exactly what happened . What happens next is just something you'll have to find out on your own , as it would definitely spoil the movie to talk further about the plot . Apart from the script and acting , the movie has very catchy mid-50's American music and a few VERY explicit sex scenes that make this movie a bad choice for the kids . PS - - this movie reminds me of the Oscar-winning ANTONIA . Both are strong feminist films , but Mávahlátur doesn't seem nearly as preachy and is a better film .
460649	2467618	36716	8.0	I loved this silly 40s B-movie	To many , this film will seem pretty silly and insignificant . I admit it . But , for what it was , it was one of the best . This film was meant to be a silly escapist film - - not a " big " movie but a B-movie meant to entertain the kids and adults alike . And , it was a major step up from the average B-western ( which , after seeing a few , looked the same ) . And the audiences loved these silly , yet magical films . This happens to be one of my favorites . Before I even saw it , I saw a publicity photo of the very sultry Maria Montez as the Cobra Woman - - dressed in a turban , evening gown and lounging across a giant cobra statue . Considering I was about 13 or so , I think I fell in love ! I HAD to see this hot lady in the film ! Well , when I finally located a video of it years later , I finally had my chance ( though by then , I had found my own " Cobra Woman " and didn't have quite the same pressing need as when I was a teen ) . It was silly but intensely exciting - - with lots of action , campiness and Jon Hall as the only man virile enough to tame this " she-beast " ! I loved it and wanted to see it again - - it was magical and just plain fun ! See it and enjoy unless you are a super-sophisticated person . I love foreign films and art films but sometimes I just gotta have some mindless B-movie fun !
459069	2467618	70707	8.0	very stupid , well-polished fun	Woody Allen's previous efforts , BANANAS and TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN , were exceptionally funny but very uneven films . His being a bit of an amateur in the film business is pretty obvious in these movies . However , by the time he created SLEEPER , he was a lot more polished and consistent film maker . While this is still a very stupid and sophomoric film , it is very funny nevertheless . While there are occasionally bad moments ( such as the giant chicken ) , they are very few and the humor just keeps hitting you again and again . I particularly liked the Orgazmatron and the history lesson he gives the futuristic professors . This film is slapstick and dopey - - exactly the type of film that intellectuals ( the audience for most later Allen films ) will probably hate . This is Allen for the common man - - back when he used to be very funny .
462372	2467618	2391	8.0	A tad obvious , but good stuff for its day	This is a short by D . W . Griffith that stars both Mary Pickford and Lionel Barrymore ( though , like other Biograph shorts , there are no credits listed on the film ) . It's worth seeing just for these stars so early in their careers . A lady dies and makes the nice preacher ( Barrymore ) to promise to carry out her wish that he buy something nice for her daughter out of some money she has saved from her no-good husband . The nice daughter sees a really awful and gaudy hat in the window of a shop and wants it ( the hat was actually " tasteful " for 1911 - - it looks AWFUL today and very tacky ) . So , to fulfill his trust , the preacher buys her the hat anonymously . However , some dried up old prunes see it and begin spreading malicious rumors . But , by the end of the film , the old biddies get theirs ! ! By the way , on the wall of the home is the American Biograph logo ( the studio making the film ) . This occasionally appears on some other Biograph shorts and must be some sort of inside joke - - after all , who has this " AB " logo on their walls as part of their decorating scheme ? !
459301	2467618	32976	8.0	Exceptional but perhaps a tad overrated	While I have always thought this movie was a bit overrated , it is still an exceptional film and those on IMDb who gave it scores of 1 or 2 are way out of line . Overrated it might be , but it STILL is a very good and interesting film . First , I'll complain about a few things - - then discuss all the good about the film . The original story by Daphne du Maurier was a lot more risqué than the film - - with a bisexual story line that is only barely hinted at in the movie . You really can't blame the film makers for this , as the Hollywood Production Code wouldn't allow this plot line to be pursued . So , instead , Rebecca was promiscuous but only with men . In addition , I am really amazed that Joan Fontaine received the Best Actress Oscar for this film . Her character often stared into space and appeared more slow-witted or annoying than just a " fish out of water " . My daughter watched the film with me and said " why is that lady acting so twitchy ? " . In other words , she behaved in a rather strange and inexplicable manner during some of the film - - particularly when she was at Mandalay . Also , I really couldn't understand why the DeWinters kept their crazy old housekeeper - - after all , she tried to drive the mistress of the house to suicide . Isn't this grounds for termination of her services ? ! ! Now , despite these complaints that definitely mar the film , there was so much to like about the movie . The script was daring and creative despite the limitations . Most times I see a movie , I say to myself that it reminds me of some other films I've seen , but in this case REBECCA is truly unique and creative . The film also had many , many twists and turns and provided one of the best endings I have seen in some time . In addition , I also liked the camera-work and music , as they created a wonderful ambiance . Despite being a black and white film , it was a beautiful picture . So my advice is to definitely see the film but just be prepared to ignore the plot holes . A hole-ridden film , to me , is still worth seeing in some cases , but somehow doesn't seem worthy of being in IMDb's top 250 .
464369	2467618	1213846	8.0	Very short - - very cute	This video was just recently featured on IMDb , though I notice the list of featured short films is constantly changing and may not be available for viewing in all countries due to copyright issues . Of all the many videos I have so far watched on IMDb , this must be the very shortest - - at well under two minutes . However , despite its short duration , it's a very clever and engaging film that has a great point to make about relationships and technology in the 21st century . Two people sitting near each other leave their cell phones open on the bar . At this point , images of both people appear on the phones and start communicating with each other without their owners touching the phones . In other words , the phones fall in love THEN contact their owners to try to get them together . Very cute and well done - - well worth a look - - especially since you are only out 2 minutes of your life if I am wrong !
464127	2467618	1091783	9.0	This looks like an absolutely amazing proposal for a full-length movie - - I sure hope so .	This is a short film that features a great story idea . Not only that , but it's handled so very well that I sure hope that this film was made to convince investors to consider putting up money for a feature-length version . If so , I can guarantee I'll go see it as the story really caught my attention . In fact , the whole thing looked absolutely perfect , though I didn't give it a 10 because I rarely do and the whole thing is a tad incomplete - - though still exceptional . A young family man finds out that he's terminally ill . So he calls someone who you assume must be his brother . The ill one is well-groomed but the other is scruffy , as he's a drifter and a drinker . In an odd twist , the ill brother proposes that the other brother takes his place - - you assume this is spare his family the loss . In a montage where you see the drifter shave off his beard , get a haircut and dons glasses , he's now the exact image of his IDENTICAL twin . What a great idea - - I just wanted to see more and see how it would all work out , though you assume by the ending that it did . Haunting and amazingly well done - - I wanna see more , please !
463780	2467618	53131	9.0	extremely interesting whether or not you are Catholic	I kind of stumbled onto this movie one night . I think I was just too lazy to get up and change the channel , as I'm not a huge fan of Audrey Hepburn and I had no interest in seeing a movie about nuns ( probably a reflex reaction after having seen The Flying Nun and The Singing Nun - - cringe , cringe ) . However , despite having very low expectations , I found the movie to be extremely fascinating . I am sure some may find the film drags a little but I was interested in seeing the ceremonies required in the process of becoming a nun . Then , the movie became even more interesting when she was sent to the Belgian Congo ( the same country where the Joseph Conrad book HEART OF DARKNESS is set ) . The acting and direction were simply wonderful . What I really liked was how he nuns were not portrayed in ridiculously idealized ways and because , for a change , we actually see Audrey Hepburn play a Belgian ( her true nationality ) .
463233	2467618	36279	9.0	In the correct context , this is a wonderful little film	This film must be understood in the context for which it was made . While this is a film made by talent from Warner Brothers ( with voice work by Mel Blanc and production by the folks at Looney Toons ) , it was NOT intended for general release - - but was meant to be shown to soldiers to illustrate the importance of keeping troop activities secret . You can tell this is the case for several reasons - - the cartoon is black and white ( when Looney Toons had just recently switched to color ) , the guy at the newspaper stand is reading a magazine entitled " SEX " and the female Nazi spy has a radio hidden in her boobs . This was certainly NOT intended to be seen by the kids ! So , with it's more adult humor designed to appeal to those in combat , the movie did a wonderful job of conveying its central message in a cute way - - using great animation and a crazy rhyming style that is very , very catchy . Even today , this film is worth seeing - - not just by history teachers but by anyone wanting a good laugh or wanting to see what life was like during the war .
459305	2467618	16801	9.0	One of Charlie's best	I think most of the reason I liked the movie so much was the pairing of Chase with Buddy the Dog ( in this movie , called " Duke " ) . Buddy had previously starred with him in the film WHAT PRICE GOOFY ? and it was nice to see them together again . In all , they did five movies together and their pairing , believe it or not , reminds me of W . C . Fields and Baby Leroy - - together they are just funny . Charlie is a nice guy who comes to a woman's aid . Her parents are trying to force her to marry a rich member or the royalty , but the woman just doesn't know him . So , Charlie poses as a butler and infiltrates the home where she lives . Unfortunately , they own a dog and Charlie is afraid of them . However , his desire to help over-rules his fear and much of the short film is spent caring for the family dog . These scenes are cute - - especially when he is told to " give Duke a bath - - and DON'T take NO for an answer " . Well , Charlie thinks the prospective husband ( the guy who is descended from royalty ) is what the lady of the house is talking about and so he forces this guy to strip and get in the shower ! It's a funny mistake as the suitor is apparently a duke and the dog's name is Duke ! Well , once the mistake is corrected , it's time to wash the DOG and a simple thing does awry - - with funny complications . In the end , thanks to the comedy formula of the day , everything is wrapped up just fine and Charlie not only gets the girl but wins his future in-laws undying gratitude . This movie is silly . And don't we need a little of that from time to time ? NOTE : gr8dane's posting is correct . There is no way that Buddy the Dog is a Great Dane . While big by today's standards , he appears to be mostly Boston Terrier - - this breed was a lot bigger in the 1920s and Buddy looks to be about 30 pounds . How could anyone have thought this was a Great Dane ?
458270	2467618	381020	9.0	A very good premise for a full-length film	WARNING : This film deals with very adult themes ( date rape ) and has strong language . While it is all appropriate for the film , it's not for children . Adults should use common sense before having the young folk see this ! ! Duh . This film is about a couple sleaze-bags who operate an internet porn site . Despite the fact that one of the guys probably raped a woman a few years ago , his partner seems content - - that is , until photos are posted on the site of the rape . What happens next is truly surprising and exciting . Most independent shorts these days seem to be made with the intention of attracting backers so that they can perhaps make full-length versions of these shorts or impress the financial people that they have what it takes to go on to bigger things . Well , if that's what the folks who made ATTACHMENT have in mind , I am sure if the right people see this dandy film then they can't help but get the funding . That's because the film is a great idea for a full-length film - - with all its twists and turns and great plot ideas . Heck , there are more surprises in this 15 minute short than you often find in a 90 minute film ! A terrific short film that left me wanting more .
458766	2467618	1042407	9.0	Not quite as funny as the first one , but still it was a lotta fun !	In the mid-1960s , Jim Henson and the Muppets were famous in the Washington , DC area and were finally getting noticed nationally ( such as on The Jimmy Dean Show , among other venues ) . Despite this success , their " bread and butter " was still making commercials as well as this short film for Wilson's Meats . I assume it was shown at either a stockholder meeting or a company-wide meeting as a sort of pep talk . However , instead of being dry and forgettable , thanks to good writing this is clever and funny - - so funny that you should go to Google Video to find it . Even if you are a vegetarian and don't like meat - - find it ! The combination of puppets , behind the scenes shots , hilarious self-parody and in-jokes are simply a hoot to watch and any serious fan of the Muppets needs to watch this as soon as possible !
459266	2467618	51739	9.0	a movie that improved after a second time	Although most Americans have little knowledge of his work other than Star Wars , Alec Guinness produced an amazing body of work - - particularly in the 1940s-1950s - - ranging from dramas to quirky comedies . I particularly love his comedies , as they are so well-done and seem so natural and real on the screen - - far different from the usual fare from Hollywood . I first saw this movie when I was about 13 or so , and didn't appreciate it very much . Years later , when I became fascinated with Guinness ' Ealing comedies , I decided to give it another chance . And boy am I glad I did ! ! The movie concerns the life of an extremely edgy and rather nasty artist . Guinness really plays this up and creates one of the quirkiest and funniest characters I have ever seen . In essence , the man is a rascal that is driven to create his art regardless of what it takes to get it done ! What I missed the first time I saw the film were the extremely catchy music and the amazing art created for this movie . I am not the biggest fan of modern art , but the second time i saw the movie I really liked most of the works done for the movie - - it just was a darn shame that much of it was destroyed in the course of the movie ! In addition to music and art , the performances throughout of all the actors was nearly perfect . Finally , the version of the movie I saw last was from the Criterion Collection . Get this version ! ! ! ! It had so much wonderful background information about the actual art , the making of the movie , and interesting background information - - such as how they got the musical score WITHOUT having to pay royalties and the incredibly sad tale of a magnificent performance by a young supporting actor that did not live to see the finished product .
462206	2467618	70723	9.0	Far deeper and intelligent than what first meets the eye	This is a brilliant sci-fi movie that is very strange in how men and women both view the same film . I have talked to many people about the film and almost every guy loved it and said it was brilliant - - while most women thought it was just disgusting and stupid ! This is the only movie I know of that has such polarized views based on gender . Perhaps many women just have a lower tolerance for disgusting or depressing plots - - but whatever the cause , I have always found this difference fascinating . The film begins with a murder and a subsequent investigation headed by Charlton Heston . This is set in the near future and the head of the huge international Soylent Corporation has been assassinated . As the film unfolds , you quickly realize this is a terrible and highly inequitable future American society . The rich live in gorgeous apartments with security and all the pleasures money can buy ( including " furniture " - - a euphemism for paid mistresses that come along with the apartment ) . At the same time , the masses are dirt poor , unemployed and in many cases living in abandoned cars or apartment hallways . Overpopulation and smog have taken a severe toll and the future looks awful indeed ! Why the rich man died and the awful truth he could not live with I really should NOT discuss - - it could ruin the film for you . However , the film has a great plot and acting and is super-exciting to watch . Plus , it features Edward G . Robinson in his final screen performance as the crusty sidekick to Heston . Though not for the easily depressed or squeamish , this is a great sci-fi film that is allegorical and profound .
461252	2467618	50658	9.0	Utterly charming - - they certainly don't make them like this any more !	This is a very charming romance from director Billy Wilder . Much of its charm is due to the excellent acting of its leads - - Audrey Hepburn , Gary Cooper and Maurice Chevalier . Much of the charm was due to the lovely script . And the whole thing was tied together nicely by exceptional direction and music . They just don't make them like this anymore . Gary Cooper plays an aging playboy and from what I have read about his personal life , this wasn't any sort of a stretch . Oddly , Maurice Chavalier plays a French private detective who investigates unfaithful spouses - - a serious departure from his role in GIGI ! And Audrey Hepburn , who is certainly luminous and the star of this film , plays Chavalier's young daughter . Audrey is fascinated by her father's business and ultimately comes to meet playboy Cooper as a result of this odd obsession . However , she knows he cannot love her or care about her - - as he is afraid of commitment and loves the carefree life . But , at the same time , given her sheltered life , he is most fascinating , so Audrey creates a false persona and convinces Cooper that she's been with lots and lots of men - - and is sort of a younger female equivalent of him ! Eventually , however , he is smitten and their romance becomes more serious - - causing complications for both - - he IS a playboy and she IS a naive young lady who certainly deserves better . How this is all wrapped up is where the movie really , really excels - - and the ending is one that is sure to bring a tear to almost anyone's eye . A marvelous romance that is greatly underrated and practically forgotten . You've got to see this movie ! PS - - Although the people from PETA would definitely not think it was funny , the scenes where the owner of the Yorkie keeps smacking it are hilarious . You've gotta see it to believe it ! PPS - - John McGiver is terrific in a small supporting role - - he's so gosh darn cute and contributed a lot of color to this film .
461098	2467618	50585	9.0	awful and relentless as well as great	This is certainly NOT a feel-good film , as it deals with the horrors of the Nazis and their crushing of the Warsaw uprising of 1944 . After all , there is no way or reason to make this a nice or fun movie to view . It just isn't possible . BUT , we are treated to an intensely realistic and viscerally disturbing film showing the war in all its awfulness . The first portion of the film is set in crumbling buildings and the nobility of the cause is apparent . However , the vast majority of the film is set in the sewers ( hence the title " Kanal " ) and the characters , over time , lose some of their nobility and just ache to survive . The film is intensely claustrophobic and the filth they move about in literally looks like raw sewage - - so as the characters fight for life and , in most cases , give up hope , you find yourself being pulled into their world and their terror . A great , though intensely awful film to watch . So , it comes as no surprise that I would not recommend this film to children or people afflicted with claustrophobia . PS - - if the musician seems familiar , it's because Wladyslaw Sheybal ( also known as " Vladek Sheybal " ) is one of the Bond Villains in the movie FROM Russia WITH LOVE .
464021	2467618	262147	9.0	Sick twisted and bad - - - and I loved it !	This was a great show that unfortunately many people didn't get a chance to see as it played on pay cable . I really miss it and wish that it were available on DVD . Be forewarned , however , that despite this being a cartoon , it certainly isn't a show for kids - - with sexual humor , violence , animal cruelty and all-around bad behavior . The show is a long series of very short cartoons that are strung together by a tenuous plot about a guy named " Mr . Hell " who looks like a stereotypical devil . The jokes are very hit-miss - - but they mostly hit and are hilarious . Because it's so wicked and in such bad taste , I advise you to watch it but only alone so your friends and loved ones won't know your secret .
459630	2467618	453479	9.0	Keep watching this until the end !	This is a cute little Australian short film that you really need to watch all the way through . That's because the first portion is a bit dull and you may not realize that the film REALLY will shoot into high gear towards the end . The film begins with a father and son talking about the family's sports legacy . They discuss how this tradition is being passed down for generations and there seems to be a lot of pressure on the son to continue the tradition . A bit later , you see the son practicing playing cricket and you really feel sorry for him with all the family hopes resting on him . When it comes time for the big game , you are in for a HUGE surprise and the film jumps headlong into comedy gold . I can't say any more - - I don't want to ruin the joke . Exceptionally well made . Nicely constructed and great for a laugh . The only reservation I have is that the material is a bit too racy for younger viewers , so be forewarned .
459776	2467618	120762	9.0	I really liked this Disney flick that seemed to slip between the cracks	In the 1990s , I felt that Disney made quite a few undistinguished cartoons following Aladdin . Unlike most of the world , I wasn't all that enamored with THE LION KING and subsequent offerings such as the wretched HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and POCAHONTAS were huge disappointments . Sure , POCAHONTAS is a lovely film to watch , but it's so wrong historically and it's so politically correct and hokey . And as for HUNCHBACK , the story was so dark and unappealing , I have no idea WHO the intended audience was . So it was in this context that I expected to hate or at least be underwhelmed by MULAN . Instead , it seemed fresh , well-made , humorous and fun - - something distinctly missing from these other films . While the anachronistic aspect of having a lady warrior is problematic , for once Disney had another strong and likable female lead following Belle in BEAUTY AND THE BEAST . This was a definite home-run for Disney and well worth your time whether you are a child or an adult .
461488	2467618	280222	9.0	Absolutely lovely . . . .	Had I never seen the films of Aleksandr Petrov ( such as his OLD MAN AND THE SEA and MY LOVE ) , I probably would have scored BLACK SOUL with a 10 . Petrov and Martine Chartrand both use a similar paint on glass style of animation and Petrov's is just slightly prettier - - and has resulted in Oscars and Oscar nominations for his work . This is not to say that Chartrand's work is bad - - certainly not . It just isn't quite as amazing as Petrov's . Both consist of images that are painted and they shift and change before your very eyes - - like a living painting . When you first see this , you are blown away that anyone can make anything so beautiful and artistic - - so much so that you really can't compare it to other types of animation . It's more like an art gallery come to life that constantly morphs ! BLACK SOUL is the entire Black experience from the earliest days to the present - - with the major events of the last several thousand years shown in this lovely tapestry . Although there is no dialog , the film definitely keeps your interest because the art and accompanying music are so terrific . For fans of animation as art , this is a must-see . Kids , on the other hand , may or may not appreciate this .
463566	2467618	281724	10.0	Brilliant	Before I start into the film , I should point out that there are two versions of this Finnish documentary about cinema addicts living in New York City . The first I saw was a little less than a hour long and there is a longer version that was for theatrical release . Having now seen both , I actually prefer the shorter TV version because the interviews work so much better because of the editing - - with less " dead time " and a tighter focus . Still , both are well worth seeking . My love for this documentary is for two main reasons . First , I teach psychology and have used this film to illustrate Obsessive-Compulsive behavior , various personality disorders and the recently identified phenomenon of " collectors " - - people who hoard items of practically no intrinsic value in a reaction against the shallowness of their lives . Second , with the third largest number of reviews on IMDb as of , I myself am a bit of a cinemaniac - - but not nearly to the degree of those featured on the films . While I do watch a huge number of films ( almost exclusively on VHS , DVD and cable TV ) , I also have a good job , healthy family life and don't think I'm THAT screwed up yet - - and the documentary is a great way to warn me against the dangers of compulsively watching films . This was especially brought to my attention when I noticed that almost all the odd art films they mention in the movie are ones I have seen and often loved . In particular , the one man who adores THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG said a lot of brilliant things about this masterpiece . Scary , huh ? ! I have a bit of a kindred spirit out there ! However , in the case of these rather sad individuals , enjoying the films in a traditional sense isn't possible . They are so obsessed with the details that often they don't stop to enjoy the film itself ! One man has memorized the running times of practically every film ( like a Savant ) and it tears him apart if the film is shortened by even a minute ! Another so obsessively saves every film ticket that she becomes violent if the ticket taker actually rips the ticket in half . And , even more sad , most have no lives or jobs because of this disability or mania . Some of this is because some of these people are indeed mentally ill , but most are not in a legal sense " crazy " - - just possessing very disturbed personalities ( meaning therapy or medication would probably do nothing to change their odd behaviors ) . This film opens up so many discussions for psychology students and sociologists . Much of it is because these people are all a bit different - - with different styles of their obsessions , different mental illnesses or personality disturbances . In a way , a psychology student taking a class on diagnosis could almost make a game of spotting the pathology . As for how this documentary was made , it was made by Finns but is completely in English . Plus , oddly , there is no narration - - the subjects and those who know them are just encouraged to speak for themselves . This was a wonderful choice since it was edited so well - - and narration often ruins a good documentary as it isn't always helpful or needed . Brilliant , shocking and a bit disturbing , this is not for everyone's tastes , but a wonderful film nonetheless . By the way , many who did NOT like this documentary had valid reasons but many did not - - not liking the subjects personality is NOT a valid reason nor that it wasn't a comedy nor was the knucklehead who was angry because the films the obsessed people liked ( mostly art films , foreign films and classics ) were not the same films they themselves liked ! ! ! Hello . . . . anyone out there . . . . . this was NOT the purpose of the documentary . Liking the people or their choices of films was certainly NOT the reason for this great film - - but the pathology and detrimental effects on their lives was ( as most of them did NOT work but were on the public dole due to someone considering this a true disability ) .
461945	2467618	382932	10.0	One of Pixar's best	This film is exactly what Pixar needed to steal the thunder from Dreamworks ' latest release , SHREK III . In many ways , this is very ironic , as one of Pixar's best films , MONSTERS INC . , was overwhelmed when it was released due to the first SHREK's success . I honestly think if SHREK hadn't been such a wonderful movie , people would have noticed that MONSTERS INC . was an exceptional film . Now , Pixar gets some payback with one of their best , RATATOUILLE . Actually , RATATOUILLE is probably Pixar's best film , though I did enjoy TOY STORY II and THE INCREDIBLES . The reason I was so overwhelmed by this story was that it was so highly original and creative - - I simply cannot compare the plot to any other film ( something you can do with THE INCREDIBLES and TOY STORY II ) . Plus , after years of making CG movies , the look is taken to a whole new level in this film - - it just looks breathtaking . Now I need to point out that RATATOUILLE is not as much a kid's movie as its predecessors . Sure , it can be enjoyed by the kids , but the story line is a tad darker and covers an adult concept ( illegitimate birth ) and includes a swear word ( though not one the really " bad " ones , you can be sure ) . Also , while the rats are kind of cute ( and a marketer's dream ) , most of the rest of the story isn't and there are no catchy kid's tunes . No , instead this film is aimed more at teens and adults in its sensibilities - - something that really helped make SHREK a financial gold mine and cursed MONSTERS INC . to be seen ( incorrectly ) as " just a kid's movie " . Amazing animation , excellent writing and , the rarest of rare , a completely original and captivating plot make this a winner and film that will be long remembered . I can't wait to see it again .
464057	2467618	87056	10.0	the best version of this timeless classic	I have seen many different versions of this story and I think that after the 1984 version with George C . Scott they should have stopped making remakes . I am not saying subsequent versions are bad ( the Patrick Stewart version is excellent ) , but that the Scott version is so perfect and well-crafted that there is simply no need to try again ! Scot is the best Scrooge - - with malevolence and selfishness in spades ! In addition , despite this , there is a deeper humanity about his character and the writers were brilliant to focus so much on the societal aspects of the story as well . The hungry masses were only alluded to or shown in a cleaned up way in other versions , but here starvation and desolation are ugly and important to the plot and are just as Dickens had intended . Other stories have tended to focus too much on Scrooge while sometimes ignoring the important allegorical aspects of the tale . Dickens felt it was not so much a Christmas story but a story of the responsibility the rich have to their fellow man .
459127	2467618	18183	10.0	Absolutely marvelous and so full of charm , . . . not to be missed !	Wow , what a wonderful little film ! While I have a VERY hard time giving movies a rating of 10 , this one sure came close . No , on second thought , it is about the best example of the genre in silent form , so it merits a 10 . For its day , it's an absolutely great romantic comedy that is sure to even get the curmudgeons out there to smile ! And , the best part about it is that film is not overly sentimental or sappy - - it just exudes quality and craftsmanship . Mary Pickford stars as a sweet and simple girl who works as a stock girl for a 5 and 10 cent store . A new employee ( Buddy Rogers - - the future husband of Ms . Pickford in real life ) is hired and it's her job to train him . Unknown to her and the other employees , the young man is actually the son of the owner of this large chain of stores - - in other words , he's loaded ! But , his father is a practical man and wants him to try to work his way up the company ladder and find out about it from the inside . At the same time , the boy is already engaged to a rich society girl that the boy's mom has picked out for him . However , over time , Mary's sweetness wins him over - - all during which she has no idea who he really is . Instead of telling you more ( and thus spoiling the film ) , I want to point out just why the film excels . While very romantic and even a tad melodramatic at times , the film keeps a pretty light mood as well - - striking a wonderful balance . The production values are absolutely top-notch - - excellent direction , acting and cinematography - - with the exception of one small scene in the end as the car races to the ship - - it did look pretty cheesy . But this can certainly be forgiven because the film is also written so well and really draws you in to caring about the young couple . This film is about as good as it gets for a Mary Pickford film , though I also greatly enjoyed her films DADDY LONG LEGS and SUDS . PS - - The video by Milestone was great . The print was nearly perfect , the music excellent and after the movie was over , they included home movies of Mary's real-life marriage to Buddy Rogers in 1937 - - a wonderful addition to this great film .
460909	2467618	36613	10.0	The best screwball comedy of the Golden Age of Hollywood	This has to be the absolutely weirdest and screwiest comedy starring a big name leading man during the Golden Age of Hollywood . Cary Grant very ably plays Mortimer Brewster and he , and the entire movie , are so weird that they make the films HARVEY and BRINGING UP BABY seem normal ! ! And , for Cary Grant , it's hard to believe but true that he is even better in this film than he was in HIS GIRL Friday or BRINGING UP BABY . No other leading man of his time had that same wonderful touch for light comedy . Mortimer , once a confirmed bachelor , is marrying perky and beautiful Priscilla Lane and they are they plan on Honeymooning at Niagra Falls . But before the trip , Mortimer goes home to get his things and tell his sweet old aunts that he's married . And then , . . . everything gets VERY , VERY crazy to say the least ! Mortimer accidentally stumbles on a dead body when he opens up the window seat ! When Mortimer confronts them with the body he just found in the window seat , they don't seem the least bit concerned and tell him to forget about it and go to Niagra Falls ! He finally convinces them to stop what they are doing and explain WHY there's a corpse in the house . They explain that some time ago , one of their aging male borders had a heart attack and died in the house and for the first time his face appeared genuinely happy ! So , they reasoned that if they " assist " other lonely old men to an early grave they were actually doing a great kindness ! ! It seems they have spiked the Elderberry wine with a very toxic cocktail and once the victims die , crazy old " Uncle Teddy " ( who thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt ) just buries them in the basement - - where he's already digging the Panama Canal ! ! ! Now all this zaniness happens in just the first few minutes of the film ! From there , it just gets stranger and funnier - - and produces many of the funniest moments I have ever seen - - particularly in the performances of Cary Grant , his aunts and the dreaded Jonathan Brewster , the " black sheep " of the family who stops by for an uninvited " visit " . The movie , by the way , was based on a successful Broadway play . In fact , the movie actually was completed several years before it was released , as the play's writer got the studio to agree to hold off on the film's release until the play's run ended . Instead of the anticipated few months , the play ran for several years . In addition , one of the funniest lines from the movie was actually funnier on stage . When someone sees the ugly Jonathan Brewster , they comment that he looks like Boris Karloff . In the play , this IS who played Jonathan and it must have provided a heck of a laugh !
460343	2467618	158310	10.0	A must-see for Chaplin fans and movie historians	I picked up a DVD of this British series from the National Gallery of Art in Washington , DC and it's fitting that a filmmaker be featured prominently in an art gallery - - especially since this film isn't a biography of Chaplin , but a step-by-step analysis of his working style . They did this by collecting outtakes that had been saved by Mutual Studios as well as through photos and even home movies . At first , I thought this all sounded very dry but as the film continued I realized what a great treasure this is . What I liked in particular was how they took two of his earlier non-Keystone comedies and analyzed the many , many changes the film underwent thanks to Chaplin's obsessive-compulsive film style . Considering what a gift he had for making films , this lengthy style of constructing films is forgivable and even understandable . In addition to analyzing his shorts , the documentary also chooses to analyze CITY LIGHTS as well as THE GOLD RUSH and provides many behind the scenes insights . I really liked this , since GOLD RUSH might just be my very favorite silent film ( though it's hard to say for sure , considering some of the great films of Lloyd and Keaton ) . All-in-all , this is an absolute must for serious film students , historians and lovers of silent comedy . Considering all the pain and trouble they went to in making this film , it's no surprise that it earns a 10 of 10 . FYI - - Fortunately , while this is a nearly perfect film about Chaplin , there are also two wonderful similar documentaries about Harold Lloyd ( " American Masters " , Harold Lloyd : The Third Genius ) and Buster Keaton ( Buster Keaton : A Hard Act to Follow ) - - both written by the same two writers who made this wonderful film . See them all if you get a chance ! ! Also FYI - - On the DVD is a 12 minute segment on how they assembled all the footage for the documentaries . It's worth a look to give you insight into this very laborious process .
458591	2467618	33729	10.0	Never watch this film without a box of tissues !	This is one of the best films of the 1940s but I've gotta warn you that it might take quite an emotional toll on you to see it ! That's because the film is about a family of Welsh coal miners who experience many , many tragedies . And , because the acting , direction and writing are so superb and they must have had a genuine love for the material . As a result , you feel a very strong connection to the characters and it is truly painful at times to watch . But , given that the film seems so real and the film was so lovingly made , you will also most likely find yourself glued to the screen . It truly is an amazing and must-see film . The film is told my Roddy McDowell's character after he is grown and is reminiscing about life in his small Welsh town when he was just a boy . For his first acting job , McDowell did an amazing job . The only problem at all is that several years were to have passed in the film , but poor old Roddy always looks the same age ! But this is such a minor problem that it can be overlooked . At first , the valley where he grew up in seems very idyllic . It's still beautiful despite the coal mine and the family enjoys a certain level of comfort . But , as the years pass , the wages begin to drop and the once lovely locals show that down deep they aren't so lovely - - though all the while , the focal family in the film maintains its dignity and decency . I actually liked this aspect of the film , as in the beginning things just seemed too perfect - - slowly exposing this undercurrent was marvelous and seemed awfully real . In addition to all the sad moments , there were some wonderful and happy moments as well ( though in general , there seemed to be more sad ones ) . I particularly enjoyed the scene where the two local men went to Roddy's school and beat the man up in front of the class . He really , really deserved it and the scene was handled very well . The most amazing thing about this movie is when and how it was made . The film originally was to be made in Wales and in color , but WWII came and spoiled all that ! So , the movie was actually made in a set constructed in Malibu - - but it looks just like Wales ! I know , because I have visited Wales and it was spot on ! But , given that Malibu isn't the same lush green color but more of a yellow-green , this forced the film to be made in black and white - - which I think actually works better in this film anyways . To learn more inside information , try watching the AMC short film " AMC BACKSTORY - - HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY " - - included on the DVD of this film . By the way , I feel compelled to throw in my two cents worth concerning the controversy over this film beating out CITIZEN KANE for Best Picture . A lot of people love KANE and it's a great film , but I have read some knuckleheaded comments online about " how bad HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY was " . Perhaps the wrong decision was made ( though I would have voted for HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY ) , but you can't rationally say that this isn't a great film - - and probably John Ford's best - - it's THAT good ! ! ! It IS possible to love both films !
460195	2467618	20414	10.0	For 1929 , it was great !	This is the very first Silly Symphony short from Disney . While I have never been a huge fan of these films because they are all basically well animated music videos , I sure liked THE SKELETON DANCE . The biggest reason is that for 1929 , it was amazingly good - - with super animation . Plus the whole package was very high on the cool as well as creepy factors . What a great film to show for Halloween . Oddly , the opening credits appear in total silence . However , once the film begins the music starts . This certainly got my attention ! The film consists of four skeletons in a graveyard coming out at night to dance and have a good time . This would have been very repetitive had the film been longer , but at a little over five minutes , it was just perfect .
464374	2467618	49456	10.0	Painstakingly perfect	I have always liked this movie - - despite not being a great fan of Van Gogh's work . However , I recently came to absolutely love this film and can really appreciate the artistry of the producers and director - - they OBVIOUSLY really cared about the story and did so much to replicate the life of Van Gogh . Let me explain . I teach a psychology class and part of the class involves discussing famous people with mental illnesses . Considering I teach at an arts school , it seemed natural to show and discuss Lust for Life . In addition , I picked up perhaps the definitive book on the paintings of Van Gogh . As we watched the film , I flipped through the massive book and was shocked how accurately everything was portrayed in the film . The locations , scenery and characters were absolutely dead on in every respect . In particular , all the little bit characters in the film looked almost like clones of the paintings of these actual people Van Gogh knew . For example , the sailor friend , his doctor in the mental hospital , the artist Pisarro and MANY others were just about carbon copies . In addition , the myth of Van Gogh was avoided in the film . Unlike the common story , Van Gogh did NOT cut off his ear and give it to a prostitute . The exact nature of the event is a little confusing , but no reputable historian would tell the often repeated story about the prostitute ! It was likely a suicide attempt and only a portion of the ear was torn off as he was slicing his throat - - or , he did it as a histrionic reaction to a fight with his crazed friend , Gaughin . The only MINOR short-coming is that in a couple places , Kirk Douglas ' acting seems a little overboard . But , considering how his performance was OVERALL , this can easily be overlooked . Also , although Van Gogh cut off most of his ear as a result of a suicide attempt , the movie accidentally SWITCHES which ear was removed - - look carefully and you'll see .
462027	2467618	402159	10.0	A truly lovely film	This film is included on a DVD entitled " Shorts : Volume Three " . Oddly , I have seen volume One already and Three is definitely much better - - though both are worth finding for lovers of short films like myself . This film shows a boy named Daniel going about his daily life . He seemed like he's depressed , as he doesn't join the other kids in sports and his emotions are very flat . The next day , he pretends to be sick so he can stay home from school . However , after his mother leaves , he sneaks off on a cross-country adventure . This film really sneaks up on you , as it starts off very slowly and quietly - - plus , you really aren't sure what's happening because the context for what you are seeing isn't revealed . However , the film makers did a great job in establishing a mood - - with an excellent but stark piano score and excellent film work . Instead of worrying about what's happening , just sit back and watch - - the film ultimately packs a very emotional wallop . Exceptional in every way .
