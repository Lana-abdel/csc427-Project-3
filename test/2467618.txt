459023	2467618	70248	1.0	Reason # 253 to hate the 1970s	JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEAGULL is a film about a bird and his philosophical musings . As he flies about , he wonders if there's more to life than just eating fish heads , how high he can fly and is there some special purpose to life - - all in a live-action two-hour film ! Yes , this is # 253 of why you should hate the 1970s - - right between the song " Muskrat Love " and Richard Nixon ! Okay , there really is no such list - - but if there was , this film would be on it ! That's because this is a god-awful film that was actually embraced by " with it " people and made the book a huge best-seller and the film a must-see . And to make it worse , the film is so deadly serious and tries so hard to be philosophical - - while all it really consists of is a seagull flying about as inane dialog blares on the screen . Could this get any worse ? ! Well , yes , because while the music does sound lovely , Neil Diamond also sings several songs that made " Heartlight " ( sure to be included if there was a " reasons to hate the 1980s " list ) seem hard-edged ! So what positive things do I have to say about the film ? Well , the cinematography is lovely and must have been spectacular on the big screen . Also , when Neil Diamond isn't singing , the music is lovely . However , with two hours to the film , these reasons become irrelevant after just a few minutes as the rest is just a ponderous pile of . . . . well , . . . guano . And the fact that so many once-respected actors LOVED the project and agreed to do voices for it is a testament to the power of mood altering drugs and hippie psychology ! ! Harry Medved included this in his book " The Fifty Worst Films of All Time " . While I have disagreed with some of his choices , I can heartily agree that this film merited , no DEMANDED , inclusion ! In summation , I'd rather eat glass than see it again ! It's THAT bad ! ! !
463729	2467618	265870	1.0	Bad , but not even a " good " bad film	In its original form , this was called THE MADMEN OF MANDORAS , but shown in the States it was retitled THEY SAVED HITLER'S BRAIN and some additional footage was added . The story is about a group of Nazis who decided to cut off Hitler's head and shove it in a pickle jar until they could later re-attach it to another body and create a 4th Reich . To show us how bad Hitler was , before cutting off his head he screamed and ranted like someone who THINKS they are talented and can pretend to speak in German . Then , inside the jar , you see a head that looks like wax and yet can somehow speak - - yelling " macht schnell ! " again and again . I just kept thinking to myself " if they can smuggle Hitler's head out of Germany , then WHY cut off the head - - can't they just take ALL of him ? ! " . While this might not technically be the worst film ever made , it is very close - - and totally inept throughout . However , unfortunately , it is NOT timeless like bad films like PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE because unlike PLAN 9 , THEY SAVED HITLER'S BRAIN is a very dull film . You know , the sort of film that is bad but not fun to watch with friends to laugh at how bad it was . Take my advice , for a bad but fun film try PLAN 9 or TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE or ATTACK OF THE KILLER SHREWS - - this film is just boring and not worth your time .
459770	2467618	52077	1.0	The best worst-film of all time !	I've done a ton of reviews on IMDb and resisted doing one for PLAN 9 simply because it's all been said ( another reason why I often haven't reviewed too many recent films ) . However , since I often refer to PLAN 9 in many of my reviews of terrible films , it only seems right that I now get around to reviewing this wretched but wonderful film . PLAN 9 is so bad , so ineptly made and so awful that it might just be the very best film to watch with friends - - even more than MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL . Watching it solo is fine , but with friends you can delight in spotting all the inept and stupid mistakes Ed Wood made in creating this film . Some good examples are spotting the cardboard tombstone getting knocked over accidentally in the cemetery , seeing how Bela Lugosi goes from an old and tired man to a tall guy with a cape draped over his face to " cleverly " hide the fact that Lugosi died before principle filming began , and noticing the strings that suspend the metal pie plate UFOs in the sky ! ! ! There are just so many silly and stupid moments and dialog that it must be seen to be fully enjoyed . By the way , my favorite line : " The inspector is dead , . . . murdered , . . . and SOMEBODY is responsible ! " .
460955	2467618	86250	1.0	Unrelentingly vile	I am sure that I'll probably get some nasty emails about this one , but I think SCARFACE might just be one of the worst movies of the last 25 years - - - especially since it is so adored by so many and been so readily accepted as a " great film " . It is supposed to be an updated remake of the classic film of the same name from 1932 ( starring Paul Muni ) . Despite this , the movie is sloppy and cheap . Instead of good writing and intelligent film-making , they hired Oliver Stone to write a hackneyed film . The result is a deliberate assault on the sensibilities by using the f-word again and again as well as using extreme and pointless violence throughout . It's easy to say " f - - - " and the like and it's easy to have millions spent for special effects explosions and gunfire , but these alone do not constitute a good film , as the writing was almost absent in the film and it was just a giant over-the-top parody of gangster films . It's as if DePalma's mantra for the film is " when in doubt , have Pacino say the f-word or have him kill some people " . Also , while some have praised Al Pacino's performance , to me it seemed like ridiculous self-parody - - like a dirty version of the guy he played in DICK TRACy - - which , at least , was SUPPOSED to be a cartoon . None of his brilliance from THE GODFATHER is present , as he plays a buffoon . There is absolutely no subtlety , no finesse and nothing of value in the film . In fact , and I know this will again prompt some nasty emails , I really think the film is intended for a stupid and undemanding audience who actually get off on this sort of brain-rot . Avoid this like the plague - - your brain will thank you for this ! Ed Wood , Jr . could have made a much better film had he been given this budget .
460076	2467618	88885	1.0	There are so many better and less annoying kids films out there	Call me a curmudgeon , but I absolutely hate the Care Bears and wish they had never been created . They are , without a doubt , the most saccharine and bland characters created in the last 30 years . So sweet , so nice that you really wish that there was a movie that paired them with Itchy and Scratchy ! ! ! Now I am not really saying I want the really little kids out there to see ultra-violent films , but there gets to be a point when a film is so non-offensive and sweet that it nearly puts the viewers in a diabetic coma ! This means , parents , that if you are suckered into watching this with your kids , you are in for a trip to Hades ! I just can't see how any sane adult could stand watching these horrid creatures for more than about 20 seconds . On top of these complaints , the animation quality is poor and the script is so mindless and insipid that ANYTHING must be better for the kids to watch . This stuff makes the Teletubbies look edgy !
459583	2467618	333074	1.0	only to be viewed by masochists !	This was a thoroughly disgusting and pointless film that only fatheads with an inflated sense of self-importance could watch and then praise . The movie is filled with disgusting images , sleaze and human bile - - something I would never hope to see again . Were these sentiments strong enough to hopefully keep you from seeing this film - - - I sure hope so ! My thorough disgust for the film isn't because it shows the lowest elements of Brazilian society - - after all , I was quick to praise films like CITY OF GOD and CENTRAL STATION - - and these films were violent and scary . However , their portrayals of the violence and cheapness of life in the lowest social strata were meant to be eye-opening and document the horrors - - not provide a voyeuristic chamber of horrors meant only to turn our stomachs . I won't even begin to describe all the viscerally vile images from MANGO YELLOW - - partly because they make me ill just thinking about it and partly because I could only take the movie to a certain point , then I made myself get up and turn it off ! In addition , the film is strongly anti-Christian and pro-filth - - so it tries at the onset to alienate much of its audience . I worry about the types of people who CAN watch this film all the way through and it DOESN'T nauseate them ! AVOID it at all costs . If you want a similar experience , go to a slaughterhouse ( it's in the film ) or stare at feces ( it's also in the film and is apparently eaten by one of the scum in the film ) . Thorough garbage .
461282	2467618	52646	2.0	ABout what you'd expect from a cheap early 60s horror flick	I bought this DVD for $1 at Walmart . After seeing it , I might just return to the store and try to get my money back ! The only reason I gave the movie a 2 and not a 1 is that the story has a few novel story elements , though it really never rises to the level of being interesting . This film has all the earmarks of being a made for the drive-in theaters market - - ultra-low budget , amateurish acting and a liberal dose of sex ( for an early 60s film ) . In fact , I wonder if perhaps the only reason the film was made was to make a fast buck AND because someone knew some strippers they could use as extras . The film is about a wacko doctor who wants to transplant his girlfriend's severed head onto the body of an unsuspecting donor . Most of the potential donors are skanky strippers or a model - - whose only real purpose in the film is to titillate as they remove most of their clothes . However , they keep too much on to make the movie even worth watching for the naughty bits and the film isn't quite awful enough to merit watching by bad film buffs .
462773	2467618	35784	2.0	not 100 % wretched	This must be a rotten film if I label it " not 100 % wretched " . That's because although most of the plot is very familiar and the acting is lousy ( apart from the competent Zucco ) , there are one or two reasonably decent moments AND the movie is , thankfully , only 60 minutes long . Oh , and it could be worse - - the Bowery Boys COULD have been in it . Otherwise , this is a very forgettable poverty row picture ; i . e . , a film made by an ultra-cheap minor film studio and intended only as a B-feature . I only watched it because every so often I watch stupid old films in the hope that they will be so bad that they are funny ( such as PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE ) . Unfortunately , this film isn't THAT bad , so my advice is only watch it if you have absolutely NOTHING else you could possibly do ! Incidentally , this film has sometimes been labeled a " horror film " . This is a slight mistake - - the label should read " horrible film " .
458722	2467618	71249	2.0	not nearly as vile and pointless as I expected	This is one of 50 films that were featured in the book THE FIFTY WORST FILMS OF ALL-TIME by Harry Medved . While this is one of the most brilliant books of this type ever made , on occasion , it discusses movies that aren't truly bad enough to make the top 50 . This movie is one of these movies . While I would agree that it is pretty much crap , it was okay quality crap - - and that's just too good for any book on dreck . While it was true that the movie was pointlessly violent and stupid , there were actually a few moments in watching it that I didn't totally hate it - - though they were greatly overshadowed by the bad ones . Nauseating and over-done scenes involve Warren Oates talking to a disembodied head that is festering as well as many , many slow-motion death scenes - - a Peckinpah trademark that is getting pretty old by this film . I would recommend this movie wholeheartedly to lovers of excessively violent and poorly written , acted and directed films . For all others , particularly kids , old people and the easily nauseated , don't bother . Some movies are simply violent and pointless and this movie certainly qualifies as such a film .
464417	2467618	156843	2.0	relatively speaking , a " good " Ed Wood flick	Although this is a terrible movie , by the standards set by Bride of the Monster , Plan 9 From Outer Space and Glen or Glenda , this is not that horrible a movie . Any other director would have cringed at creating this movie , but Wood should not have since it least it shows he improved a little . While the movie does have some scenes where it is alternatively day and night , this isn't as striking as in Plan 9 . However , the overuse of stock footage is once again employed - - with about 172 , 000 scenes of police cars driving down the road spliced into the movie is a completely random and nonsensical fashion . Also , some of the acting is so poor it would be laughed at in a high school play - - particularly the old lady in the police station and her husband , " goldarnit " . Officer Kelton plays a moron in a way that really had me believing he was a complete moron due to his horrid acting . But , the police chief was fairly competent and Tor Johnson was at his best because he did not talk at all - - just let out little whines - - an EXCELLENT decision based on his acting in Plan 9 ! Criswell is back - - and this time not as the narrator but as an integral part of the schlocky conclusion . So why did I give the movie a 2 ? Well , it shows improvement plus the plot of a phony medium who gets his due is somewhat clever . I especially liked the wanted poster in the wall at the police station . Though it was BADLY made ( it sure didn't look real ) , I laughed when I noticed the picture on it was Ed Wood ! Too bad for all the fans though , as they might expect another Plan 9 or Bride of the Monster and find the movie is just bad - - not funny because it's so bad !
460212	2467618	71095	2.0	What can you expect with a budget of only $48 . 98 ? !	I have been trying to find a copy of ABBY for some time and tonight I have finally seen this supposedly lost treasure . Apparently , Warner Brothers Studios felt it was rip-off of THE EXORCIST and the film was pulled from circulation prematurely . It also was not seen on video or laser disk and only recently appeared on DVD . The print is horrid and looks as if someone sat with a video camera and recorded it as the film was being played - - it was that bad . The colors were a mess , too - - most of the film had a strong red tint to it . Additionally , there were scratches throughout - - making it the ugliest quality DVD I have ever seen . Well , despite the horrid quality of the disk , I do feel that the film is unique and not exactly a copy of THE EXORCIST . In fact , there are so many differences that it seems ludicrous today that Warner felt they had any claim at all to stop the film . Plus , quality-wise it wasn't like anyone would mistake ABBY for THE EXORCIST ! ! While the DVD extras proclaim it as a masterpiece and it " was NOT bad like the Blacula or Blackenstein movies " , I heartily disagree . While I have yet to see BLACKENSTEIN , the Blacula movies ( BLACULA and SCREAM BLACULA SCREAM ) look like Academy Award winners compared to ABBY . Other than all three films starring William Marshall ( a capable actor stuck in cheap films ) , they just don't compare . The Blacula films weren't bad at all and ABBY is a wretched film with wretched production values from start to finish . The acting , aside from Marshall , is very , very amateur , the sets and props looked bargain basement and the story was just silly . Worst of all , though , were the demon special effects that weren't much better than something you could make at home . So what does all this add up to ? Well , not a good movie , certainly . . . but also a movie that is fun to watch for its camp value . In other words , it's so stupid and so inane , that it's great for a laugh . So far in my life , I've seen about 50 so-called " blaxploitation " films and this is the worst - - even worse than the dull Dolemite films . Now THAT'S bad ! !
459920	2467618	36179	3.0	Just okay Superman cartoon	In general , I am not a huge fan of these Fleischer brothers cartoons - - mostly because they are too fast-paced . It's like they are trying to cram 15 minutes of cartoon into 6 minutes . So , because of that , the mystery and thrills they are trying to create just don't work - - since the solution occurs so quickly after the problem is established . For example , when Clark , Lois and some archaeologist enter the mummy's tomb , the coffin has been rigged with a poison quill . But , as soon as the audience becomes aware of it , Clark finds it and removes it - - how he did this so quickly is really a puzzle - - even if he IS Superman . Also , as usual , the animation quality lags far behind other products from the same company . Just compare these simple but colorful drawings to Popeye cartoons and it's obvious they were rushing the cartoons into production . By the way , watch for the introduction speech about " faster than a speeding bullet , . . . " , as the words are VERY different to what we think this speech should be . No locomotive or tall buildings mentioned !
461528	2467618	36548	3.0	A big step backwards for the Sergeant Doubleday films	This B-movie was one of a long series of war comedies starring William Tracy as the bright and lovable Sergeant Doubleday . While I loved the very first film , TANKS A MILLION , the series was pretty uneven - - with some being very good and a few ( like this one ) being pretty poor excuses for movies . My score of three might be as low as it is because I knew that these Hal Roach produced films COULD be enjoyable and original - - this one was not . In fact , in some ways it was like a dull film with bits of 3 Stooges thrown in for good measure . In this film , Doubleday and his annoying friend Ames were shipping out overseas to action . As usual , Ames is Doubleday's foil and I think this is a major weakness of these films . After a couple films , Ames becomes very tiresome and his character just grates on you . He's ALWAYS selfish , stupid and trying to hurt his friend Doubleday - - and after a while you start to think " what's funny about that ? " . In TANKS A MILLION , it worked well - - here it's just bad . Plus again and again , second-rate gags are used that just don't provide laughs . Unfortunately , the film also does not end well - - the Japanese sub segment is just lame . Oh , and while I am ranting about Ames , I thought I'd throw in a few words about continuity . From film to film , continuity is a major problem . Ames is a master sergeant in his first film , but stripes keep disappearing in subsequent films - - even though time and again his superior officers praise him and he is rewarded for brains and courage . Also , the sweet Ames goes from girl to girl in the films - - making him seem pretty fickle since he is engaged to a couple of them ! Unfortunately , the only real constant in the films is Ames . Why , oh why Ames ? ! If you are a fan of the series and MUST see them all , then by all means watch this one . If not , then see TANKS A MILLION and leave it at that . The film is one of the best war comedies of the 40s - - perhaps THE best and a lot funnier and timeless than the very popular BUCK PRIVATES . Oh , and the other reviewer is right - - the helmets were worn backwards throughout the film !
462477	2467618	19684	3.0	Pretty dreadful , even for 1929 and ONLY of interest to die-hard Charlie Chan fans	This is a globe-hopping film that begins in England , then moves to India , Iran and finally San Francisco . The story involves a sociopathic murderer who kills someone and then marries a nice girl . Once married , he treats her like dirt and cheats on her . She puts up with it until she discovers that he was a murderer . Then most of the film consists of her trying desperately to avoid him as well as scandal if the secret were be revealed . This is the earliest Charlie Chan film known to be in existence and it is absolutely nothing like the later films - - nothing . Apart from the name " Charlie Chan " , there is no similarities to the later exceptional series . Back in 1929 , films were often a bit stilted and overly melodramatic . Because the studios weren't used to using sound , the actors tended to remain very stationary ( due to poor sound equipment ) and the dialog sounded more like plays than movies . I accept this and tend to rate these early talkies with this in mind . However , even keeping this in mind , BEHIND THAT CURTAIN is still a dreadful film - - even for 1929 . The main problem is not how constricted the actors were due to the sound equipment but how gosh-darn awful the dialog was . In fact , I would have to say that the love scene in the desert might just be the absolute worst love scene I have ever seen and heard - - it was THAT overly melodramatic and stagy as well as laughable . I truly believe that most high school actors could do a better job today . In addition to horrible dialog , the movie suffered from being way too slow - - and the first half in particular crawled at a snail's pace . Later , despite the horrid dialog and acting the film did pick up a bit - - but certainly not enough to make it even passable entertainment ! I think the biggest problem is that the film clearly shows those involved with the movie weren't used to talking pictures . However , my complaints weren't just about the wretched dialog and pacing , but also the acting and direction . For example , the film starred Warner Baxter who was an exceptional actor . He was famous not just during the silent era but in sound pictures like the Crime Doctor series and such excellent films as PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND and KIDNAPPED . I loved how he played such realistic and likable " everyman " characters , but here in BEHIND THAT CURTAIN he was a simpering idiot who overdid the love scenes - - making him one of the biggest liabilities in the film . The female lead , Lois Moran was perhaps even worse . The only actor who came off well ( very well , actually ) , was Gilbert Emery as the Scotland Yard inspector . One reviewer pointed out that the only good element was the cinematography , though I would differ . While it was exceptional seeing the sound outdoor shots of the caravan ( for 1929 getting this right was VERY tough ) , all too often the camera was static . At one point it was even laughable , as the scene began with just the tops of the characters ' heads showing - - like the camera should have been several feet lower . This was because the couple were about to stand and instead of moving the camera or using a cut , they just left the camera on and created a very awkward and sloppy scene . Now as for Charlie Chan , he was only a bit player who appeared in a very limited capacity in the last 12 minutes of the movie . Surprisingly , he was actually played by an Asian - - something you'd never see in the 30s-50s . However , this isn't all positive as E . L . Park had the charisma and charm of a bag of lint . They simply gave this actor nothing to do - - making him just a glorified errand boy for Emery . Also , Chan oddly was NOT a Hawaiian-based detective - - instead serving in Chinatown in San Francisco . Also , Mr . Park didn't look as Chinese as Warner Oland ( who was a Swede ) - - looking more like a native Hawaiian ( though with a Korean name ) . Chan was supposed to be a Hawaiian but of Chinese descent . Because of these inconsistencies and a thankless part , the " Chanophiles " out there will no doubt find all this very disappointing . In conclusion , the plot wasn't bad but due to horrid acting , dialog and direction this is one supposedly lost film that might just as well as have remained lost ! Also , in a small role is Boris Karloff . While it's not a huge role , this excellent actor acquitted himself well in the role of a devoted servant . It was nice to see him in a pre-Frankenstein role .
464025	2467618	19788	3.0	While historically important , also a terrible film when seen in the 21st century	I actually had a previous review for this film that I just deleted and am replacing it with this new and updated one . That's because I first tried watching COQUETTE on videotape from MGM but the sound was so horrendously bad that it was practically unwatchable . It was just re-shown on Turner Classic Movies and while the sound improved slightly , it was still an awful chore watching and understanding the film - - particularly since they never bothered to Close Caption the movie . The big problem was that the movie came out in 1929 and sound systems for films were brand new and often were inadequate . In this film , the sound varies according to who is speaking - - some of the actors come across loud and clear and others ( such as Miss Pickford and the man who played her brother ) were a major chore to understand . You can't blame the actors for this , but it seriously hampered my enjoyment of the film . Now as for the film itself , I am shocked to see that this film has a huge number of scores of 10 on IMDb . Maybe this is because it was such an important film historically speaking . It was Mary Pickford's first sound film and she did win the Best Actress Oscar for it . Sadly , by today's standards , she was not particularly good to put it mildly . I also wonder if maybe giving her the Oscar was a way to pay tribute to her vast collection of earlier works . While I do love Mary in SUDS , SPARROWS , DADDY LONG LEGS , MY BEST GIRL ( probably her best film ) and so many other silent films , she just didn't seem to deserve an award for her overly melodramatic performance here . Overall , her emotional range was HUGtoo huge to be believable . In fact , overall this was a not particularly good film and seems horribly old fashioned and silly . So often , lines were delivered as if this were an old-time morality play being performed in front of a lot of hicks who loved and expected over-acting . Much of the film seemed stagy and the film went on way too long . Also , there were many story elements that seemed so contrived and stupid . The worst of these was at the end of the film when Pickford's father grabbed the gun which had been submitted into evidence for this courtroom scene . Inexplicably , it was STILL loaded and they left it right where this accused murderer sat ! ! How ridiculous can you get ? ! ? ! Please , do yourself a favor and try some other old-time films first . I am a huge fan of both sound and silent films from Hollywood's Golden Age and there are too many deserving films you should see well before viewing COQUETTE . In fact , any of Pickford's silents would be preferable to this wretched film .
459730	2467618	33021	3.0	as long as you ignore history and reality , this is a fine movie	This is just the sort of Hollywood epic that makes US History teachers have strokes when they watch them ! Although there has been a long history of playing fast and loose with the facts , this is probably the WORST big budget historical film from Warner Brothers . And this is sad because the same studio produced many exceptional films based on real characters and events ( such as Dr . Ehrlich's Magic Bullet ) . BUT , because it has a lot of good actors ( such as Errol Flynn , Ronald Reagan and many others ) it gets a score of 3 . So WHAT was wrong with the movie historically ? Well , pretty much everything . All the great generals of the Civil War make appearances in this movie which is set before the war - - even though some would have only been children at the time ( and they are portrayed as adults ) and many of them never even met in real life . In the movie , they are like a big frat house where everybody knows and loves everybody else . And the events in the movie are so histrionic and silly . My advice is only see this if you are a die-hard fan OR if you hate your history teacher's guts and WANT to give him or her a stroke when you tell them Warner Brothers ' version of our history .
462678	2467618	35743	4.0	Pretty well made , but it will no doubt give many a heart attack or high blood pressure !	This is a pretty good film technically , . . . but boy is the film likely to cause extremely high blood pressure or even heart attacks in modern audiences ! ! ! And I DON'T recommend that the average person watch this , as the film is so racially offensive . In the 1940s , drawing characters of giant-lipped Black characters who spoke in Jive must have seemed very funny , but today it will most likely make many recoil in horror ! However , I do recommend you see this film if you are interested in history or the progress we've made in race relations . As a history teacher , I see this as a wonderful film just as a teaching tool - - to show us how far we've come . Plus , being a strong , strong advocate of free speech , I am loathe to encourage ANY film to be banned outright . The film is on at least a superficial level , a pretty funny and interesting piece - - particularly the wonderful ending . Just be forewarned - - it is an awful aspect of race relations that some want to forget ever existed . Of course , if you ignore or forget your past , you are opening up the possibility you won't learn from our mistakes .
464302	2467618	140638	4.0	well-acted but as funny as cancer	Despite the the title and that the first of the two stories is about a man who laughs uncontrollably when he sleeps , this movie is profoundly unfunny and probably never was intended to be . Labeling " You Laugh " ( the English language title ) is like calling WWII " a great time had by all " ! This is because this is probably the most depressing movie I have seen in a very long time - - and this is saying something because I have watched a lot of Ingmar Bergman movies recently ! ! Okay , just because a movie is depressing does NOT mean it's bad - - some of our best films are quite depressing to watch . BUT , with the title , I was ready to laugh . But , both the stories involve murder and suicide . Just when you start to care about someone , they are brutally murdered ( such as the little boy beaten to death with a huge rock ) or kill themselves . Believe it or not , these are NOT funny topics to me ( if they ARE to you , please contact the police or your psychiatrist as soon as possible ) . So why does the movie STILL score a 4 ? Well , despite the depressing nature of the film , I must say that the acting and cinematography were good . I particularly liked the opera singer from the first vignette ( of course , he later drowned himself ) . Oh well . I guess I need to watch a REAL comedy now so I can get out of the funk the movie put me in after seeing it !
462265	2467618	87078	4.0	Wilt Chamberlain and Grace Jones ? ? ? ! ! !	Please first be advised that I really am not the biggest action film fan in the world , so keep this in mind as you read . This film is a follow-up to CONAN THE BARBARIAN , but instead of being violent and intense like the original , it was much sillier and lighter in tone . Part of this is because it was really very hard to take the film seriously due to the ultra-bizarre casting . While Wilt Chamberlain was sure impressive from a physical point of view , it was just hard for me to see him in animal skins kicking butt . But even more bizarre was the appearance of Grace Jones as , . . . . Grace Jones . I guess it was just an 80s thing - - but WHAT WAS THE APPEAL OF MS . JONES ? ! Her music , to put it mildly , was crappy and mind-numbing but her acting was far worse ! She made up for her limited acting range by mostly shrieking and killing things ! This bizarre casting actually was positive in one way . Up until this film , many had questioned Arnold's ability to act or even speak English . But , compared to these two supporting actors , he seemed much more like John Gielgud in comparison ! A very trite and forgettable film .
464100	2467618	17405	4.0	a " Laurel and Hardy " film in name only	This film is a silent film . It wasn't until about a dozen films later that Laurel and Hardy made sound films , but many of their silent films are still masterpieces . Unfortunately , this one isn't . It wasn't until late in 1927 that Hal Roach realized that he had a great formula by pairing Stan and Ollie . And , this film was made earlier in the year when the genius of this pairing wasn't yet apparent . As a result , it really isn't a Laurel and Hardy movie - - they don't work together and they only receive 3rd and 4th billing . The film is about a very attractive lady who resents how her artist husband takes her for granted . Her friend gives her the idea of getting another guy to make advances towards her to make the husband jealous . Scraping the bottom of the barrel ( and gene pool ) , she picks Stan Laurel to woo her . Well , he's as dumb as ever and does a pretty lousy job of it . In the meantime , Oliver Hardy is the butler and his role is pretty much unimportant until the very end of the film . There are a few interesting and funny gags here and there , but only a few . Because of this and the missing chemistry , this film only deserves a score of 4 .
462135	2467618	2303	4.0	A whole lotta action , . . . but I'm not sure WHY	This is a short film by D . W . Griffith for Biograph Studios and is full of some pretty exciting action . Blanche Sweet is an apparently nice girl that was kidnapped and secreted aboard a boat . The only problem is , WHY ? ! There's really no context and I had no idea why some crew members from a sailing ship kidnapped the woman in the first place and why later they tried to kill the captain and take the boat . Some explanatory inter-title cards or making the film longer than 13 minutes might have taken care of all this . With just a little more work , this could have been an excellent little film . And , given that it's a Griffith film , you KNOW that the woman will be rescued ( they always are in his films ) - - so there isn't all that much excitement or suspense . It's a time-passer and that's all .
458959	2467618	437942	4.0	Interesting elements in search of a story	This was included on the disk " Shorts : Volume 2 " - - a rather dull collection of short films . Shorts are among my favorite style of films but somehow the people assembling this second collection had a hard time finding quality content - - and it wasn't nearly as good as the first volume or other shorts collections . This short film feels like it's woefully incomplete . There is a story , but so much in unanswered that the viewer , like me , feels a bit left out and unfulfilled . The film begins with a woman , her boyfriend and her Westie ( that's a dog , by the way ) going to a lonely beach . The lady speaks with an accent that , at times , is a bit difficult to follow . Given that I am hard of hearing , I sure would have loved if it had been closed captioned . Anyway , the boyfriend goes for a swim while she naps . When she awakens , her dog is gone . She panics and makes the guy follow her all about looking for the dog . They spend most of the time arguing and being disagreeable . Then , out of the blue , they stop to have sex . Later , they find the dog - - end of story . As far as the characters go , both seemed rather dysfunctional and unlikable . She was a fussy and demanding lady and he seemed to have contempt for her . When you wondered why they were together , their little sex break showed what bond kept them together . Some might like the characterizations - - I kept finding the people irritating and unreal - - more like caricatures than people you might meet or know . Also , the payoff for all this just isn't worth the wait ( unless you want to see the guy naked ) .
464047	2467618	32963	4.0	Not bad at all , but also not nearly as good as it could have been	Wow , I was really underwhelmed by this film . Despite starring David Niven and Olivia de Havilland , this was an amazingly uninspired film . After all , the story is about a rich society thief who is a champion cricket player - - you'd think there'd be more action and exotic or fashionable locales . But , instead , the film is very , very stagnant and the majority of the action ( such as it is ) takes place in a manor home where Raffles is staying along with a few other rich swells . It was so turgid , that at times I found myself falling asleep . I kept waiting and hoping for a fist fight or SOMETHING , but instead the film was very talky and all so well-mannered . A very uninspired script with an abrupt and senseless ending as well as lackluster direction conspired to keep this film in the category of ' mediocre ' , but it's still watchable due to the screen presence of its stars - - especially the always lovely Miss de Havilland .
460239	2467618	50189	4.0	A very tired film featuring an even more tired Errol Flynn	For fans of Errol Flynn , this is a rather tough film to watch . That's because after a lifetime of wild living and booze , the once handsome actor looks pretty lousy for a 48 year-old . He's puffy , flat and lacks the spark and charm that made him a matinée favorite in previous decades . Here , he's just " phoning it in " in a low-budget and rather dull film and it's only of much interest to fans with morbid curiosity or who want to see every film this star made . The story has Flynn playing a lowly blackjack dealer in a Cuban casino - - quite a comedown compared to other characters he'd played in the past . While it is interesting to see street scenes of pre-Castro Cuba , the rest of the film is a dull affair concerning Errol being tossed , quite innocently , into a bunch of murderous counterfeiters . Because he was no longer the glamorous hero , he spends most of the film being beaten up and hassled . The best fight for him is at the end when he barely manages to beat up a doughboy-like villain . Not exactly CAPTAIN BLOOD or ROBIN HOOit's really a shame Flynn's final films are generally of this low quality .
461160	2467618	808142	4.0	I was confused	I must admit that when I watched this short film I was confused . While at times it definitely looked like a mockumentary ( i . e . , a film pretending to be a documentary ) , at other times it appeared to be like a reality show . Well , after doing some searching on the web , I was able to determine that the film was real . Now I still am not sure if PARTS of the film were made up - - such as the really , really strange squealing girl who " wanted to do anything , anything to help " or the guy running like a maniac in the parking lot - - they looked staged . If this girl is real - - yikes . All this leads to my biggest complaint about the film . It didn't seem to take a clear path . If it was real , this needed to be clarified and if it wasn't then it needed more laughs . I realize the film makers are young an experienced and it did show promise - - I just hope on future projects their objective is more defined .
459210	2467618	50208	4.0	Pretty dull little tale salvaged only by Sophia Loren's cleavage	This is an amazingly lifeless movie despite it being filmed in Greece and being Sophia Loren's first American movie . While the Greek scenery is lovely , it's obvious that the biggest reason they chose Ms . Loren for the film was because of her ample breasts . Throughout the film , but particularly in the first diving scene , they are featured very prominently and it's a very risqué piece of film work for the 1950s ( sort of like the movie THE DEEP in the 1970s ) . And , unfortunately , she is given a role that is very inconsistent and not particularly likable . Much of the movie concerns her wanting to help steal a valuable ancient statue she accidentally discovered while sponge diving . She is , through much of the film , amoral and self-centered . And , not very convincingly , at the end , she falls for Ladd and does the right thing with the statue ! Predictable but also a bit ridiculous . Now to make things worse , some boob had the bright idea of pairing Loren with Alan Ladd - - one of the shortest leading men of all time and about four inches shorter than her . This meant they had to do some interesting camera-work so she wouldn't tower above him . In addition , their chemistry is , at best , tenuous despite this being a love story . There just doesn't seem to be any " spark " between them . As for Ladd , his role is pretty mellow and subdued . Apart from some scuba diving , he just doesn't do all that much in the film . The bottom line for Ladd , Loren and the rest of the characters is that the parts just weren't written all that well and the people ( aside from her little brother in the film ) weren't very interesting or compelling . A dull time-passer and certainly no indication of the acting ability of either of its stars .
459094	2467618	52637	5.0	Not a horrible film !	I gave the above summary because many might just assume that this low budget film stinks because it's included in the " 50 Movie Pack - - Chilling Classics " DVD set . This set and others by the same company are mostly films that slipped into the public domain because no one wanted them - - they were THAT bad ! ! And , in most cases , the prints are just awful - - often being dark , fuzzy or out of alignment . However , in the case of THE BLOODY BROOD , this film isn't bad at all - - at least when you consider its rather low pedigree . This film is a very low budget production that stars a familiar face ( Peter Falk ) as the bad guy . He's the unofficial leader of a group of beatnicks who generally don't look like beatnicks ( especially Falk - - though what can you expect from a counter-culture film made in Canada ? ) . Everyone in the group comes to him for inspiration , leadership and it's implied that he's their drug connection ( though oddly they NEVER said he was dealing drugs - - I guess it could have been uranium or stolen lawn jockeys or whatever other illegal activity he was doing ) . One evening , just for kicks , he gets the idea to kill someone for laughs and gets one of his flunkies to help . The unsuspecting victim is a poor delivery boy who is fed a sandwich laced with glass ! When the kid dies , his brother vows to continue the investigation that the police don't seem all that interested in pursuing . Generally , the acting is pretty good compared to other similarly budgeted films and the plot is pretty good as well . It's a nice variation on the famous Leopold and Loeb murder case that was dramatized in COMPULSION . While not as slickly produced and lacking the stars of COMPULSION , in some ways I preferred THE BLOODY BROOD since when the film ends there is an appropriate comeuppance - - something that never really happened with Leopold and Loeb . FYI - - For a laugh , watch the scene where they show a close up of the Maynard G . Krebs lookalike as he plays the bongos . If you pay attention , you'll see that his hands and the music aren't even close to being in sync and the tune is significantly faster and different than the hands would indicate - - now THAT'S talent !
463132	2467618	156578	5.0	It's amazing how short this film was and how quickly it all ends	As I said above , it's amazing how short this Patsy Kelly film is . While it was intended as a short , at only nine minutes , the movie doesn't last nearly as long as other similar films - - that usually range from 12 to 20 minutes . While generally this would be a serious problem , for me it was a blessing ! I have only seen a few Patsy Kelly films but have hated her so much for her lousy over-acting that I was thrilled this movie didn't last so long . It's hard to describe her , but she looked and sounded a lot like an obnoxious version of Rosie O'Donnell . Physically they looked pretty similar , but Kelly nearly always spoke louder than a Concord in flight ! ! Screaming your lines in a Brooklyn accent just isn't comedy - - - it's the recipe for a migraine . But as I said , the film is blessedly short and Patsy actually under-acts compared to her usual assault on your senses ! The film is about a rich dame ( Kelly ) who is trying to buy some class but has no idea what class and sophistication really are . So , some con artists try to take advantage of the situation . The movie is imminently forgettable but at least it is watchable and not bad . This is a definite time-passer or a film for someone wanting to see what Kelly looked like in a more cerebral role ( sort of like for those who wanted to see Curly Howard doing Shakespeare ) .
462879	2467618	69834	5.0	purely ordinary	This is not one of John Wayne's better flicks from his later years . It really isn't because it's a bad film , but the energy level is so low due to the fact he was so gosh-darn old ! Unlike the energy that he somehow mustered for MC Q and BRANNIGAN , this movie just seems to crawl along and offers very little more than what you might see in an episode of BONANZA or GUN SMOKE . I really wish Wayne had held out for a more worthy film , but considering he spent most of his life just churning out films , it isn't too surprising that he did the movie . The 5 rating is for the average viewer . If you are a Wayne fan , a score of 6 or 7 would probably suffice , as it is still enjoyable because it's still pure John Wayne .
463726	2467618	51570	5.0	Considering the budget and what it was , it's a decent little horror flick	This is a typical drive-in movie horror film from the late 1950s . Like all similar films ( such as ATTACK OF THE GILA MONSTER , THE KILLER SHREWS , etc . ) , this one had a very low budget , was quickly made and featured small-time actors . Naturally , the dialog was poor at times and the overall plot laughable , but in a strange way the film was still a lot of kooky fun . The spider special effects were generally very good and the story kept my interest . While those who love Shakespeare and art films probably won't appreciate this film , for those who love the genre this is a film that will most likely satisfy . As for me , I like these silly old flicks and recommend the movie - - but I also can't rate it any higher because of its questionable aesthetic value and cheesiness . PS - - Look at the marquee at the movie theater . One of the films on the bill was THE AMAZING COLOSSAL MAN and the other was ATTACK OF THE PUPPET PEOPLboth films by director / producer Bert I . Gordon who made this film .
463183	2467618	839980	5.0	Very little of the magic of TALLADEGA NIGHTS is evident here .	In SEMI-PRO , Will Farrell is the owner-manager-player for the fictional ABA franchise Flint Tropics . For those of you too young to remember the ABA ( American Basketball Association ) , it was a rival league to the NBA that really suffered due to lack of fan support as well as having teams in amazingly small markets in many cases . Unfortunately , even for an ABA team , attendance is lousy and the players are mostly untalented losers . However , when it's announced that the league is folding and four of its premier teams are moving to the NBA , Farrell is excited when it's agreed that the four teams that have the best record will become NBA franchises . This motivates him and his hapless players into finally playing like a team and it's rather predictable that they manage to pull it all together leading up to the final " big game " . In many ways , the script is quite formulaic and you know what's going to happen , but there are a few cute moments that keep it interesting . SEMI-PRO is in some ways like TALLADEGA NIGHTS and SLAPSHOT rolled into one with one major exception - - it doesn't come close to either of these movies in quality or especially laughs . This really surprised me , as I was expecting a sense of humor like TALLADEGA NIGHTS , but sadly there were only a few small moments like this - - scenes Will Ferrell was doing promotions for his basketball team . The best of these insane promotions was probably the bear wrestling scene . I think the biggest problem was that in TALLADEGA NIGHTS , the races weren't really that important - - the humor was . In SEMI-PRO , the film seemed to bog down when they actually were playing basketball - - especially since , within the rules , you can't do anything THAT crazy . I really think the film would have been better served with either less basketball or by simply throwing reality out the window during these ballgame scenes . Plus , while it sure looked like SLAPSHOT at times because of some of the fighting and a team's efforts to avoid folding , it never really went far enough regarding social commentary or the likable humor of SLAPSHOT . In addition to not quite succeeding like these other two films , SEMI-PRO was extremely vulgar - - and often not in a funny way . Too many testicle jokes , crude language and vomiting references - - and these were supposed to be the funny moments in the film . Sadly , the crude humor didn't work and really make this a film that is NOT child-friendly . If you are a Will Farrell fan , there's enough to this film that you'll like , so give it a shot . If you are not a Farrell fan , then this film will do nothing to convince you otherwise . My advice is see TALLADEGA NIGHTS and STRANGER THAN FICTION - - two exceptional films that show Farrell has some depth and can make a real crowd-pleasing film . SEMI-PRO is a bit of a dud . FYI - - Check out the trivia section on IMDb about this film . Apparently , only a short time after this film the bear used in the fighting scene actually killed someone !
461912	2467618	932545	5.0	A decent stop-motion film	This is a very simple short film that was made using stop motion and clay . Considering that it was made by an inexperienced film maker who did everything ( Caroline Kastelic ) , the project should be applauded . Heck , it's a lot better than I could make myself . And , because of this , I am encouraged by her prospects and wonder what sort of creative work she'll be doing given time and experience . The idea for this film is very similar to a " Furious George " skit made for " MadTV " years ago - - where the animals turn the tables on an researcher who is performing experiments on them . I don't think Ms . Kastelic copied off the TV skit - - it just is highly reminiscent of it . While the work could of course be more refined , as I said above , it's very nice for a first film and I wish her luck .
461449	2467618	335351	5.0	Very , very talky	This story is derived from a story by Chekov ( not the Star Trek one , by the way ) and the movie was very , very , very " talky " . And while the quality of the film's production is there ( this is why it earns a 5 - - for acting , direction and cinematography that are just fine ) , the story itself just seemed dull and lethargic . Plus , I found I really didn't like anyone - - the title character seemed like a direction-less nymph , her boyfriend an insufferable " artist " who just needed to grow up , and the rest of the family just seemed like a bunch of phonies I felt no connection to in any way . And everyone just seemed to talk and talk and argue and then talk again ! About the only thing going for this film to lift if above mediocrity is the very nude body of the title character in the first minutes of the film - - this was tough not to notice ( and this makes this movie inappropriate for kids , as well ) .
463694	2467618	86356	5.0	The first half is great and the ending pretty much ruins the film	Michael Douglas is disgusted by the legal system . He is a young judge who is tired of seeing the scum of the earth walking on technicalities while the public good is being ignored . He begins talking to his colleagues about this and is eventually asked by one of them to come to meet some other like-minded individuals . It turns out that there are many judges equally dissatisfied with the current legal system and have decided to band together to re-try cases and dispense " justice " when it was denied the first time in court . This " star chamber " is a way of righting the wrongs in the legal system , as if they all agree , a hired assassin is sent my them to liquidate the wrong-doer ! The idea , by the way , is very similar to the Dirty Harry movie , MAGNUM FORCE . The problem is that although it's a pretty good idea for a film and the acting is pretty good , the film falls completely on its face towards the end . And that's because one minute Douglas ' character likes the idea of a " higher court " for these cases , later he inexplicably recants and tries to destroy the court ! This made little sense and with a better ending this could have been a great film . Perhaps the film had such a stupid conclusion because the people in Hollywood felt really uncomfortable with producing a movie that would have advocated vigilantism and violated the generally ultra-liberal climate in the motion picture industry . Regardless , with a little more ingenuity , this could have been so much better . Just off the top of my head I can think of two or three ways to have improved the ending - - and I don't get paid to do this . What's their excuse ? !
462197	2467618	17231	5.0	A decent but not especially distinguished Stan Laurel film	Tyler Brooke is the son of a newspaper owner . His father is angry because the other local rags are finding better scandals than paper and demands the son dig up some dirt on a vamp who is in town . Now this begs the viewer to wonder if the newspaper has any reporters other than Brooke . You'd think they would but you never see any and all this pressure is placed on Brooke to get the scoop . So Brooke decides the best thing to do is arrange for a scandal himself , so he gets his dopey butler ( played by Stan Laurel ) to pose as a rich man and make love to the vamp while Brooke is nearby with his camera . While Stan Laurel is in the film , he really isn't the lead and this was made in the pre-Laurel and Hardy days . Oddly , while Brooke is clearly the lead , the film gives the vamp , Lillian Rich , top billing - - though she is on hand mostly like a decoration . The plot itself could have been very funny , but there honestly aren't all that many good laughs in the film . So it's not a particularly distinguished film and mostly only of interest to Laurel and Hardy die-hards who want to see all of their films ( both before and after their pairing ) or perhaps silent movie die-hards . Either way , the average person probably won't be particularly impressed by the relatively tame antics . By the way , I agree with " wmorrow59 " - - you gotta love the art deco outfits and apartment of Ms . Rich - - particularly the spiderweb curtains .
462701	2467618	19686	5.0	little of the Laurel and Hardy magic	While this isn't a bad film , it certainly isn't one of the team's better efforts . It's a shame really , as 1929 to the mid 30s was the absolute prime period of their work together . I guess considering all the great films they made , it's okay to have a bit of a let-down , . . . and that's exactly what this is . The routines are not especially funny and the same type things had been done before by them with better results . Stan and Ollie are a Vaudeville team catching a train to their next gig . They have trouble locating each other at the station and Ollie loses his papers from his suitcase in this opening scene - - not terribly funny stuff at all . Then , on the train , two main comedy bits are used . The first involves people grabbing and ripping each other's clothes . This has been done before and the set up for this wasn't very smooth or believable - - people just start doing it for apparently no reason at all . Next , Stan and Ollie must both climb into an upper sleeping berth designed for one . This seems to take forever and is frankly stretched too long . Really , now that I think about it , this movie was a pleasant enough short but really had no laughs . PS - - you can tell , in spots , that this film was originally a silent film or that they were unfamiliar with making sound films , as the sound is absent in some of the early scenes or seem tacked on . This isn't as bad or noticeable as in many early sound films , but if you look you'll notice .
464495	2467618	188941	5.0	Given that it's 1909 , the film isn't that bad , . . . or that good	I really do admire this film because of its amazing production values for 1909 . While the sets certainly won't rival those of later Roman epics like QUO VADIS or CLEOPATRA , the costumes were awfully good for a time when budgets for films hardly surpassed the cost of film ! So , this is a standout film in this sense . However , when it comes to the style of the film and its value as history , it is of dubious value at best . The acting seems very vague and the actors mostly stand around and wait for the next inter-title card - - there just isn't that much action on film and it seems as if the director was only yelling out a few suggestions here and there as the actors ad-libbed . This really was the style of many early films . Plus , the story is pure hokum - - as if it was written by someone only vaguely aware of the facts . It implies Nero had Rome burned and talks about his love for Poppea , but this is odd since most historians today doubt if Nero had anything to do with the fire AND Nero apparently stomped his " beloved " Poppea to death during a fit of jealousy ! ! So much for the romantic aspect of the film ! So I advise you to watch the film for its historic value and if you are a lover of early cinema . Otherwise , the film is pretty easy for the average person to skip , . . . and maybe that wouldn't be such a bad thing .
460716	2467618	295004	6.0	Very unpleasant but also exceptional	If I were solely scoring this film based on how much I enjoyed watching it or what I personally thought about the main characters , then this film would get an exceptionally low score . That's because the main character ( played by Isabelle Huppert ) is one of the most selfish and unlikable ladies I've seen in a film and watching the sick relationship between her and her daughter was often quite painful . When the film begins , you find that Huppert is a prostitute and the film makers really made her up well for the part . She had a world-worn and sad quality about her and it was obvious she'd spend years walking the streets . Seemingly out the the blue , Huppert's 14 year-old comes for a visit . You assume the teen is in foster care and Huppert responds incredibly harshly towards her - - telling her she wanted nothing to do with her . Yet , despite being rebuffed , the child insists on coming home with her . A bit later , Huppert's pimp and another goon show up and begin beating her severely . The child , not surprisingly , comes to her mother's aid and is almost raped . Almost , because she instinctively grabs a knife and kills her attacker . All this happens in just the beginning of the film and much of the rest of the film consists of them running from Nice . At first they wander purposely but later Huppert gets a crazy notion to look up her ex-husband and the 8 year-old she'd abandoned just after birth . This is very , very ironic as she is seeking to re-establish a bond with the boy yet at the same time shows all the motherly instincts of a rabid hamster ! ! You would have a hard time finding a less nurturing and vicious mother towards the girl - - who , throughout most of the film , is treated like a burden and nothing more . Although all this is very sick and disturbing , you sure have to salute Huppert for not choosing an easy character or taking the Hollywood approach to making the lady a " hooker with a heart of gold " . My only gripes about the film are about the difficult to believe plot twists as well as the somewhat pat ending . You see , at one point Huppert abandons her daughter in the countryside and the teen just happens to meet up with a runaway criminal . Now you'd sure think he'd rape the girl or rob her or at least be indifferent . Instead , he abandons his plans and acts like a big brother towards her - - as well as towards Huppert when they eventually find her - - even giving them money when they finally part . This just didn't ring very true and seemed a bit like wishful thinking - - as did the very end where , after all this horrible emotional abuse , there is a hopeful scene of tenderness between the mother and daughter . While I was often disgusted with the characters , I wish the film actually hadn't copped out - - and allowed Huppert to continue rejecting her daughter throughout the film . This blindness to her own issues and parallel with the son is so fascinating and was slightly blunted as a result of the film makers unfortunately pulling a few punches . Usually , this unwillingness to create a ridiculously happy ending is one of the strengths of French films , but here at the last minute , they bowed to convention - - and the film lost a couple points in my review because of this . Overall , unpleasant but interesting . Plus , this film is definitely Huppert's and she does a masterful job with what the writers gave her .
458125	2467618	17836	6.0	The earliest Laurel and Hardy film that actually looks like a Laurel and Hardy film	Stan and Ollie had already appeared in a couple films together before this one but their interactions bore no resemblance to them being a team . DUCK SOUP is the first where they pretty much play the usual Stan and Ollie characters , though with some small differences ( such as Ollie wearing a top hat and the characters not using their real names ) . This style was actually a bit of an accident , as following this film they made quite a few films in 1927 in which the team really wasn't a team and played very different style parts ( such as in SLIPPING WIVES and WHY GIRLS LOVE SAILORS ) . The film begins with news that because local forest fires are so bad , hobos are being drafted by the forest rangers to battle the fire . Stan and Ollie are happy and lazy and want nothing to do with work - - particularly of the dangerous variety . So they escape from the press gang and eventually hide out in a mansion that is vacant . However , soon some people arrive who intend to rent the place and the boys pretend to be the owner ( Ollie plays " the Colonel " ) and his maid ( Stan ) . Seeing Stan in drag was pretty cute and was something he did in several early films . Naturally , the REAL Colonel arrives and finds that Ollie is packing what he can steal from the home . In slapstick tradition that means one thing - - the Colonel will begin shooting wildly as the boys and the innocent renters scramble for their lives . Eventually , the forest rangers catch the boys and force them to work - - leading to a very " forced " ending . While this film is funny and worth watching for Laurel and Hardy fans , the chemistry just isn't there and the film isn't any better than any other Hal Roach short of the day . Worth seeing but far from a must-see unless you are a nut like myself who wants to see every Laurel and Hardy film ever made ( minus the lost ones such as HATS OFF and ROGUE SONG ) . FYI - - When the movie begins , you may notice that a tiny bit of it is missing and the print is , in places , poor . Unfortunately , this seems to be all that remains of this film due to the degradation of the nitrate stock .
459381	2467618	35767	6.0	NOT the strangest Crime Doctor film , but it's still pretty good	This is one of the earliest Crime Doctor films and perhaps when they wrote the script they thought it would be the good doctor's strangest case - - though compared to some of the later films , this one is pretty ordinary though a tad confusing - - certainly NOT particularly strange . The film begins with a very young and handsome Lloyd Bridges taking his fiancée to see Dr . Ordway . A short time later , Bridges is accused of committing murder and the doctor decides to investigate . Some of the plot twists were pretty weird and confusing . In fact , though you expect the plot to continue to be Ordway convincing everyone that Bridges is not the killer , this is only the film up to a point - - as soon it becomes apparent that many people had a reason to want to kill the victim . Plus , soon more murder victims begin popping up in the oddest places ! Overally , I really liked the plot ( even though it was confusing ) and the twists and turns worked out very well except for the actual way in which the first person was murdered . The manner chosen was so ridiculous and impossibly complicated that I really think this helped knock the film's rating down a point or so . Otherwise , if you can ignore this silly twist , it's an engaging and entertaining film .
464002	2467618	70016	6.0	A decent film in need of a remake	This film was made by Hanna-Barbera - - therefore by default , it has , at best , second-rate animation . And it also features a lot of pretty forgettable songs . Together , these two problems prevent this film from being anything more than average . And it's really a shame , as the story by E . B . White is wonderful and the movie is pretty faithful to the original . In addition , the voice characterizations are just fine . While my complaints will not ruin the film for kids , most adults will understand my observations . From what I have read on IMDb , a new version of the film is in post-production now ! Let's hope they stay faithful to the script and bring up a more adult-friendly version !
463327	2467618	71636	6.0	While very interesting artistically , it didn't do much for me	This is a fascinating film - - not so much for what it says but because it looks so very , very early 1970s . When I watched it , it brought back memories of super-wide neckties , crazy hair and intense colors . I also liked the quality of the animation - - though it was , at times , hard on the eyes . The way things seemed to morph in the film was pretty interesting . However , while there were some interesting elements , the film got old very , very quickly . It was so hard on the eyes and other senses that it was tough watching it to the conclusion . I can see that all the other reviews have been extremely positive and I'm glad they liked it . However , I truly can't see the average person sitting through this film - - it's definitely for a very select audience .
461237	2467618	1660	6.0	Pretty good for 1911 , but otherwise it's a reasonably forgettable film	This film will most likely NOT change you into a fan of early films or the once-famous actor , John Bunny , who stars in this film . However , when the film was made , it was a pretty good picture and his fans loved it . Nowadays , you might be bored by the overly simple plot , but for 1911 it was actually pretty good in this regard also - - with some slapstick humor and an " evil stepmother " theme that was pretty popular in its day . Mr . Bunny ( he's not a rabbit - - that's his real name ) is a rich widower who has an obnoxious little daughter who he dotes over continually . However , he is advised my his aunt that the child needs more discipline in the form of a strict governess . He agrees and is sexually fixated on the nasty governess ' hair - - so much so that he not only ignores how mean she is but asks her to marry him ! This plot line isn't very believable and when seen today , this is a bit hard to take . However , the marriage is averted when a housekeeper takes action - - convincing the brat to cut off the nasty governess ' hair while she is sleeping . Since Mr . Bunny only loved the lady for her hair , the wedding is off and the man and child live happily ever after ! A strange plot , I know , but a lot of fun to watch - - especially when the hair is whacked off and the old battle-axe is left with nothing to recommend her .
459969	2467618	120855	6.0	okay . . . . just okay	I think a major problem with me watching this film is that the character Tarzan has been done so many times that I frankly am pretty tired of him . He's been in 1001 films and at this point , what is there to add to the story that hasn't already been said ? Generally , this movie seems to say " nothing " . The addition of " cool " gorilla playmates wasn't enough to invigorate the series and as a result of such familiarity of the content , the film is just a very well-made time-passer . Sure , it's very good technically and my kids enjoyed it , but the film has very little lasting appeal . I've been to The Magic Kingdom dozens of times and apart from just after the film debuted , there is almost no reference to it - - nothing . And I think this says a lot about this adequate film .
460495	2467618	763320	6.0	Nice idea - - but it didn't need to be THAT crude	A couple with severe marital difficulties enter the office of their counselor and just begin screaming and unloading on each other - - so much so that the poor guy behind the desk doesn't have a chance to say anything . When he tries , they just continue arguing . Finally , he's able to get them to stop - - at which point the film takes a lovely little twist . The idea behind THE ONE O'CLOCK and the final punch line were great - - very clever indeed . However , there are some exceptionally crude lines in this little short that are bound to shock most viewers and I don't know why they had to have the lines in the short - - especially because if they delete one line in particularly , this is a short you could show your kids . But , as is , this is a short you'll want to watch when the kids are asleep or visiting friends or are locked safely away in their cages . Too bad . With a tiny , tiny bit of editing , this film could easily earn a score of 8 .
462094	2467618	33117	6.0	a genuinely odd film	Wow . This was one odd little Joan Crawford flick ! Joan is a self-centered spoiled rich lady . And then suddenly , she has a religious conversion and she spends all her energy on God . The problem is , that is soon becomes apparent that the self-centered and histrionic lady is actually the SAME person she always was - - she just annoys everyone around her in a new way by talking about God . At times , she talks as if she has somehow found a direct link to God and has " inside information " . Her conceit is incredible . And , by the end of the film , this dizzy and shallow dame is on to her next obsession . Overall , this isn't a great film - - especially since Joan's character is awfully broad and difficult to believe . But it is entertaining and strange enough to merit a look .
460434	2467618	19616	6.0	Intentionally strange , . . . but still pretty watchable	This film is one of many short films from a DVD collection from Kino Video about silent Avant Garde films . Because of this , the films are extremely artistic but make no attempt to be commercially viable or interesting to the average person . Instead , since they are " art " , the films are often confusing and apparently pointless - - since this IS the point of the Avant Garde movement ! However , of all the many films in this collection , this is probably the most " normal " and approachable film for the common person . The short film is about a sleazy sort of bald , skinny guy who is trying to con people out of money - - passing off a counterfeit coin . However , once he amasses a tidy sum of money , other " rifraff " do their best to steal it away from him . It's all a very strange little morality play that also has a point to make about how far the German people had fallen during the poverty years of the Weimar Republic . Interesting , with some unusual camera-work and images , but probably not a film for most audiences . If you ARE looking for an " artsy " film but find this type of film I described sounds too unusual or esoteric , maybe you should try the films of the great French artist / director Jean Cocteau . Other than his BLOOD OF A POET , his other films combine artistry and Avant Garde imagery with well-constructed plots and familiar movie elements . My favorites of his films are Orphée ( Orpheus ) and La Belle et la bête ( Beauty and the Beast ) .
460328	2467618	437825	6.0	Heck , it's not a great film but John C . Reilly makes it likable	There is something disarming about John C . Reilly's screen persona that makes you want to like him . In silly films such as TALLADEGA NIGHTS and WALK HARD , even if I didn't love the film ( such as with WALK HARD ) , I found myself liking the character played by Reilly - - even with his many foibles . Here , Reilly stars in a black and white short where he simply asks people " Are you the favorite person of anybody ? " . I assume the people were all actors , but the film has the look of reality about it . What was interesting is that the film got you to think about this for yourself - - a potentially sad and lonely or affirming question indeed . While nothing dramatic or life-changing , this was a likable and interesting little film .
459640	2467618	35124	7.0	Unexpectedly original and worth seeing	This movie really surprised me . In the 1940s , Bela Lugosi made a huge number of grade-Z horror films . They might be fun to watch , but all too often the films have tons of plot holes and they were obviously made with practically no budget . This film , however , has very good production values and is quite original - - and as a result , I had a very good time watching it . Now before I go any further , it's important to note that although Lugosi got top billing and the videotape cover prominently shows his face , the film really ISN'T a Bela Lugosi film . His role , unfortunately for " Lugosi-philes " is amazingly small and ill-defined . He never seems to be the star nor does he have much to do with all the weird murders that are occurring in the film . In many ways , this is like the appearance of Lionel Atwill in the film - - he's there but his part is terribly small . Despite this , the film is still excellent and most of this is due to the excellent writing . The story is quite original and although I could guess early on who was committing all the murders , the way it was handled was very clever . Probably the best part of the film , though , was the part played by Robert Homans , as the Constable . He has so many wonderful and funny lines that I thoroughly loved watching the old curmudgeon investigate the crimes . Finally , a bit of trivia . The rich old man in the film is played by Ralph Morgan . He bears a lot of physical resemblance to Frank Morgan ( the Wizard from the Wizard of Oz ) because they were brothers .
459843	2467618	105399	7.0	One of the better Chan films	Please note - - this review is for the English-dubbed version . It's about 11 minutes shorter than the original film and I have no way of knowing how close it stuck to the original vision . It seemed to be dubbed reasonably well , but having never seen the original Chinese version , I am only guessing . The idea of making a Corsican Brothers-like film with two Jackie Chans sounded pretty dumb when I read about this movie . And , while in parts it is awfully silly , the overall effort was far better than I expected and was one of the better Chan movies I have seen . The movie begins with a prologue which shows how two twins were accidentally separated just after birth . The parents cannot locate the lost child and are forced to raise the remaining child . The second is fund by what appears to be a prostitute and this child is raised in a poor household . Many years later , when the rich and privileged Jackie returns to Hong Kong , he accidentally is mixed up for the poor one - - the one that the local mob wants to kill ! Now had this just been an action film with fight scene after fight scene , I think it wouldn't have worked as well . But , given that Jackie Chan did the movie a huge amount of comedy and clever situations involving two separate girlfriends were infused into the plot . Several times , I found myself laughing at some of the silliness of it all , but I also was impressed by how well the film all worked together pretty seamlessly . There were only two complaints about the film . First , the poor Jackie snorted a lot . Why ? Couldn't there have been a better way to distinguish between them than making one of them sound like he's a pig or has a really bad cold ? Secondly , the film seemed to go on a bit too long - - particularly at the action-packed conclusion . Knocking five or ten minutes off would have probably made the film a bit better - - as the fight scene just went on and on and on . Still , this is a decent martial arts film and is worth a look and a laugh . FYI - - The film's second billing went to Maggie Cheung - - a relatively famous Asian actress who has made a variety of excellent films . However , her role was no bigger or more prominent than the other lady in the film who didn't appear until much further in the credits . Bummer .
458852	2467618	489551	7.0	Not bad . . . and amazingly unconventional	This film is about a mid-life crisis . The main character is a 50-something man and his life is monotonous and he's beginning to question who he is , his job and his relationships . His boss is horrid , his wife is good but sexually undesirable and the teenage son is a jerk . The way this story is told is pretty creative as well as very confusing . In parts , it seems like a simple narrative whereas in others it's very surreal - - making it tough to understand what is really happening . While I like SOME of this style , I really wish the film had been a little more clear in spots , as by the end of the film you really aren't sure what the man is doing with his life or if he's even sane - - though I am sure this is the intention of the writer / director . This uncertainty , while it will annoy some will also endear this film to others , as life is so uncertain - - especially as you hit middle age and have so many unanswered questions . Would I want to see many more films like this or see this one again and again ? No , but it was a nice film by a group of young film makers and it shows promise for their future careers .
461266	2467618	355	7.0	Not bad , not bad at all	For an early film , this one is actually pretty good . In this silent movie , the crew re-creates a fire and shows the firemen doing their job - - starting with leaving the firehouse all the way through rescuing all the victims . It's sort of like a documentary of their job that is done by re-staging what looks an awful lot like a real fire . Unlike some similar films , this one looks authentic enough that it both entertains and gives us insight into the profession in 1901 . I particularly liked seeing the horse-drawn fire wagon as well as the people jumping out the window into the trampoline-like device the firemen use . Pretty good stuff and a pretty good historical record to boot !
461659	2467618	34936	7.0	The film has some problems , BUT with Hepburn and Tracy , it's bound to still be enjoyable	This is one of the less famous films starring Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn and after having seen it again recently , I can see why . While their performances are excellent ( particularly Tracy's ) , the movie itself is a bit hard to believe and comes on a bit too strong . I'm sure this is a result of the time in which it was made , as the film had a very strong injection of patriotism and Americanism thanks to our being brought into WWII . In many ways , the film was like a variation on MR . SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON , except that Smith dies and in the end you find out he's a Fascist ! ! The film begins with the death of a famous American patriot and all around great guy . However , despite a tremendous outpouring of sympathy , his widow refuses to see or talk to anyone . . . that is , until reporter Spencer Tracy appears . Then , slowly the story of this great man begins to unfold , though over time Tracy can sense that it's all a put on - - there IS some secret that they are trying to hide from him . In the end , the secret is revealed and Hepburn inexplicably dies - - and I really didn't understand why she so quickly died and Tracy seemed just fine even though he was in the same burning building ! The film does have a few plot holes ( like the one mentioned above ) and at time it lays it on a bit thick , but still , based on the charisma of the stars , it's still well worth seeing . Just don't expect magic .
463041	2467618	104652	7.0	a good film that just ends abruptly	This is a beautiful film and I longed for its domestic release . Unfortately , I felt very disappointed at how the movie just abruptly ended . It looked as if they were on some sort of deadline and since they were running behind , they just ended the film ! It's a real shame , as up until the ending , the movie was great - - exceptional animation and direction throughout ! I've seen many Miyazaki films and this was the first that disappointed me ( though , I must admit when I saw Nausicaa I was even more disappointed ) . Instead , try watching Kiki's Delivery Service , My Neighbor Totoro , Spirited Away , Princess Mononoke or Castle in the Sky - - all are much more complete and satisfying Miyazaki films .
458901	2467618	155796	7.0	a little uneven but fascinating film	This film gives a fascinating look at life in Japan in the last months of WWII . Dr . Akagi brings a sense of humanity and compassion in an otherwise tired and spiritually bankrupt country . So , while the people are either giving up or shouting jingoistic sayings and insisting the war is NOT lost , he just goes about his job saving lives and crusading within the government for more attention and funding for the Hepatitis outbreak . Throughout the film he is tireless and decent . However , along the way , there are a lot of detours and other characters - - some that work and some that tend to distract ( such as the scene involving the prostitute and the whale ) - - taking this movie from a score of 8 or 9 and dropping it to 7 . Nevertheless , it's still an excellent film and well worth your time - - giving unusual historical insights . PS - - an excellent companion film to this would be FIRES ON THE PLAIN ( 1959 ) . This film shows Japanese soldiers in the Phillipines just before the country falls to the Americans . It shows the end of the war through the viewpoint of very tired , hungry and broken soldiers .
461420	2467618	724	7.0	By modern standards , it's really poor , . . . but for 1908 ( or so ) it's pretty good	First off , the video from Milestone Video says this film was made in 1910 but IMDb says 1908 . I am not a real stickler , but they are actually talking about the same film , so try not to be confused . Now considering that all of this Shakespeare play was boiled down to only ten minutes ( about the length of MOST films of that era ) , the film does a respectable job of conveying the story - - though of course all the subtlety is missing as well as the subplots . But , compared to other contemporary movies based on Shakespeare , this is among the best because of its relatively high production values and because the entire film was hand painted to make it a color picture ! Considering most silent films were shown at about 16 to 24 frames per second , that means that about 10 , 000 cels had to be painstakingly painted ! ! And while this certainly doesn't compare well to Technicolor , for 1908 or 1910 , it's truly an amazing job . Overall , it's not a film most today would enjoy ( especially many Shakespeare lovers ) , but for film buffs like me , it's worth the time .
461001	2467618	190552	7.0	Very good , but not great drama of love and obsession	This is an extremely beautiful movie that was filmed in the stark landscape of the Canary Islands . The film begins with a rather restrained and dull young man coming from Spain to be the island's doctor . One of his servants is the young Mararía and the doctor does not appear to show any great interest in her . Later , an English vulcanologist arrives and is instantly smitten with the girl . They soon begin screwing like sex-crazed weasels and she plans on their upcoming marriage . But , the Englishman is a jerk and has no intention of marrying her - - even when she becomes pregnant . When the doctor hears this , he murders the Englishman and stuffs him and his belongings into one of the volcanic vents . But despite her being jilted , the woman insists the Englishman will return one day . Soon afterwards , the doctor is drafted and does not return for almost six years . When he does , he is obsessed with the woman and even tries to force himself on her . She refuses to marry him ( who would after being pawed like that ? ) . Later , he tells her he murdered the Englishman and she should stop waiting and marry him . She naturally reacts to this and he tries to rape her . She then tosses herself into a fire and the movie ends . While much of the plot is quite interesting , it switches from intelligently written and compelling to stupid and inexplicable - - thus reducing the film's impact . Having the doctor kill the Englishman was not a bad idea , but then to be SO obsessed and attacking the girl repeatedly made no sense - - especially after he had previously shown little interest in her . Plus , her tossing herself into the fire , while cool to watch , made little sense . It's a shame because with a few tweaks , it could have been a much better film . Still , despite its flaws , it's worth seeing .
461851	2467618	52792	7.0	excellent entertainment	This isn't among Jimmy Stewart's best films - - I'm quick to admit that . However , while some view his film as pure propaganda , I'm wondering what's so wrong with that ? Yes , sure , like the TV show THE FBI , this is an obvious case of the Bureau doing some PR work to try to drum up support . But , as entertainment goes , it does a good job . Plus , surprisingly enough for the time it was made , the film focuses more on crime than espionage and " Commies " . Instead , it's a fictionalization of one of the earliest agents and the career he chose . Now considering the agent is played by Jimmy Stewart , then it's pretty certain the acting and writing were good - - as this was a movie with a real budget and a studio who wasn't about to waste the star in a third-rate flick . So overall , it's worth seeing but not especially great .
461044	2467618	35440	7.0	An exceptionally weird but very watchable propaganda film from WWII	This was one weird film . . . . and I mean REALLY , REALLY weird ! Yet , despite being so weird as well as being such an obvious propaganda piece , it is still very watchable today . Plus , I know that when the original play and this movie debuted in Britain , they were extremely successful , so it was obviously an important film for the morale of the British people . The film begins with a whole lot of obviously British actors trying to fake American accents and doing a terrible job - - so badly that it made me laugh to think that the British saw us that way and I now wonder if Americans doing British accents sound that bad to the Brits ( I assume we must ) . Oddly , some of the actors ( such as the very English James Mason ) didn't even attempt accents and I wonder how many people noticed this at the time . I'm sure American audiences would have noticed . This is not a major problem , but it sure was noticeable . The story is about a disenchanted newspaper reporter ( Michael Redgrave ) . Well before the war , he traveled the globe documenting all the signs that a war was approaching . However , despite the rise of militarism in Japan , Italy and Germany , the people at home were sick of war following the last one and just didn't want to listen ( which was definitely true ) . So , when the war finally arrived , Redgrave left the UK and moved to the most isolated place he could find - - a lonely lighthouse on a tiny island in the Great Lakes . However , and here's the really weird part , he wasn't alone as the ghost-like memories of the victims of a shipwreck near the lighthouse were his constant companions ! No books , no TV and no radio - - just him and his imaginary dead friends ! The most exciting and wonderful actor among these dead imaginary friends was the Captain , played by Finlay Currie - - a wonderful actor you might have seen in IVANHOE , WHISKY GALORE ! or BEN HUR . While his name is NOT well-known , this very prolific and exceptional actor really made an impossibly silly plot come to life . Currie and Redgrave both introduce several of the dead passengers from the long-lost ship ( from 1849 ) and both had their own unique perspective . Redgrave imagined their deaths to be both meaningless and bigger than life , while Currie showed that all these people were running from something - - something bigger than them - - just like Redgrave . By the end of the film , Currie ( who was imaginary ) convinced Redgrave to stop being a hermit and do his part for the war effort against Fascism - - a not especially subtle but very rousing ending indeed ! Good acting made this silly stage production come to life . A very interesting yet preachy film from WWII .
458672	2467618	86450	7.0	good film but so much like the original , why not just watch it instead ?	Jack Benny did a few really good films - - such as THE MEANEST MAN IN THE WORLD and TO BE OR NOT TO BE . Despite that he often made fun of his film career , he was pretty good when he played something other than " Jack Benny " . And , in this version of TO BE OR NOT TO BE , Mel Brooks , instead , plays the lead . And , he does a competent job . The problem is , Jack Benny did such a good job in the original , why remake the film in the first place ? I would have been a lot happier if they had just re-released the original to the theaters once again . Although , I must admit that Brooks is unusually restrained and does show respect for the material . So my advice : watch this film and then see the VERY SIMILAR original .
461400	2467618	1024848	7.0	Not much in the way of a story , but great visuals	This is an odd little film with few words and the story itself leaves so much unsaid - - yet it's still a dandy little film due to the excellent camera work and editing . The story begins with a man with a full head of hair and beard . He goes to an older woman's apartment and together they go to the barber's for his hair and beard to be completely shaved . When finished , the lady collects the hairs and they leave . This kept happening again and again - - showing that over many months or years this occurred . There was no reason given for this odd ritual but the film is still worth seeing because of clever camera work and visuals . Interesting , but very odd - - and certainly not everyone's cup of tea , so to speak .
461414	2467618	50454	7.0	Like a prettier and more well-made version of La Terra Trema	This film is highly reminiscent of another film , LA TERRA TREMA . Both might be considered Italian Neo-realist films , though LA GRAND STRADA AZZURA does feature a big-name actor in the lead ( Yves Montand ) and a big budget - - somethings that a Neo-realist film cannot have to be technically this type of film . However , I am apparently one of the few reviewers on IMDb that really disliked LA TERRA TREMbecause the acting was so incredibly amateurish as well as the lousy camera-work . Instead , LA GRAND STRADA is beautifully filmed in color and Montand is the centerpiece around which all the non-professional actors are anchored . The film itself is also a little more exciting because it deals not just with a family of fishermen like the other film , but a family that illegally uses homemade dynamite to fish ! ! And the negative impact on the fishing industry and the other fishermen makes for some great tension . While this certainly isn't a great film , it's a very , very good one and has an excellent ending to wrap it all together . By the way , do not get the idea that I dislike Neo-realist films and prefer big-name actors and budgets . No , I actually love movies such as UMBERTO D , MIRACLE IN MILAN and THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US ( all by Vittorio De Sica ) - - it's just that there are also a couple truly awful and amateurishly made Neo-realist films as well that I really hate - - and apart from STOMBOLI , LA TERRA TREMA is probably the most boring and unwatchable Neo-realist film I have seen . You are MUCH better off just watching this film - - it's very similar but interesting - - and avoid LA TERRA TREMA unless you are a masochist and you actually like very slow and miserable films .
459954	2467618	72564	7.0	Pretty good , but in season 2 it " jumped the shark "	This was an incredibly ambitious sci-fi series produced in the UK for international distribution . It was extremely expensive for its day and unfortunately , the series never took off due to a Luke-warm reception . Some of this can be blamed on the series itself - - the show had a very sterile look and action was something it was usually lacking . While Martin Landau and Barbara Bain were fine actors , the parts and script were amazingly low-key for the genre . Additionally , had it appeared a few years later , after the sci-fi craze began following STAR WARS , it probably would have fared better . Another problem is that although I enjoyed the show , there were huge changes ( mostly unwelcome ) in the second season . Because the show was struggling in the ratings , huge cast changes were made . The most notable ones were the loss of the wonderful doctor ( played by Barry Morse ) and the introduction of a shape-shifting alien ( Maya ) who seemed rather inappropriate to the style of the show . The intention was to pump some life into it , but devotees of the series like myself were not particularly pleased ) . Overall , there were some amazing episodes ( such as the one about the Queller Drive ) and some bombs . It's a shame , really , as the show deserved to do better than it did .
462428	2467618	1076838	7.0	I'm hungry .	I know this was an odd summary , but while watching this short documentary about the huge over-population problem with nutria in Louisiana , I kept wondering where I could get one to taste for myself ! Perhaps I've been watching too much of Andrew Zimmern on the Travel Channel , but I found myself thinking how nice it would be to find a restaurant in my part of the country that featured this giant rat-like creature on the menu ! As for the film , it's a decent little introduction to the common nutria and it discusses a wide range of topics about the little beast - - such as its becoming a nuisance creature , how it got to the US in the first place , nutria cuisine and pop culture and the nutria . About the only thing it didn't talk about ( and I wished it had ) is that the critter is NOT the same thing as a muskrat - - though they look about the same to me . Overall , fascinating and a little-discussed part of our American culture that's worth seeing for yourself .
459768	2467618	52655	8.0	The best Beatnik murder comedy I've ever seen !	The film begins in a beatnik coffee house where the customers love to listen to bad poetry and revel in their own senses of self-importance ! In this locale , we have Dick Miller who is a somewhat simple-minded waiter who desperately wants to fit in but is mostly laughed at by the stupid customers . After accidentally committing a murder AND wanting to fit in , Miller becomes an artist by covering a hapless cat with clay . Well , these self-absorbed boobs were amazed at the sculpture and proclaimed Miller's genius - - not knowing that a REAL cat resided within . But , needing to produce more " great works of art " , he feels compelled to kill humans for the sake of art . Fortunately , as his first human victim he chooses Bert Convey - - not a bad choice , really , as I never particularly liked this 1970s game-show regular and frequent guest on The Love Boat ! While this is NOT a great film by any objective standard , I can see why due to its oddness and silliness that it's become a cult favorite . As you would expect from early Roger Corman films , the budget is negligible and the film was designed for drive-in crowds ( i . e . , 1950s teenagers ) , so you know it can't be especially deep . However , considering just how low the expectations should be for such a small film , it was a pleasant surprise - - offering excellent writing , a great sense of humor and generally decent acting . While it isn't nearly as silly or as fun as the original LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS ( which co-starred Dick Miller ) , it does have some similarities and is well worth your time .
459399	2467618	451079	8.0	Excellent family entertainment - - and thank goodness it doesn't stray too far from the source material .	Okay , many of you are about to become offended , but I've gotta say it . The movie version of " How the Grinch Stole Christmas " ( THE GRINCH ) was a horrible movie in practically every way . The worst problem with it is that the entire moral lesson of the original story is lost and in fact the movie states the exact opposite of what the author intended ! ! In the book and Chuck Jones special , the Whos were nice folks that didn't need all the presents as they were sincere in their reverence for the holidays . In the Jim Carey remake , the Whos were all selfish and materialistic ! ! What a horrible way to ruin Dr . Seuss ' vision ! It's like translating the Bible and making Satan the good guy ! In light of how far THE GRINCH strayed , I especially loved HORTON HEARS A WHO because it didn't wander far from the source material or convolute the moral of the story . Sure , the story was changed a bit and several subplots were added , but I could accept this - - after all , they had about 88 minutes to fill and there had to be SOME padding . However , the original story can still easily be distinguished and perhaps after this film , Seuss can finally stop spinning in his grave ! ! So , apart from the faithfulness to the original story , what did I like ? Well , I was once again thrilled to see Fox making CGI films . Their ICE AGE films were pretty good and HORTON is even prettier and more entertaining . Quality-wise , this is about on-par with a Pixar or Dreamworks production . I particularly loved Whoville - - as with powerful computers , they were able to animate hundreds , if not thousands , of wonderful Whos . And it was cute all the little tiny touches - - so much so that the film holds up well to repeated viewing in order to catch all the action and details . Plus the town looked very Seuss-ian - - like the pages of the books come to life . It was a real joy to watch . Was there anything I didn't like ? Well , the song at the end by REO Speedwagon was simply terrible way to wrap up the film . It was schmaltzy and pointless and looked as if the producers were stuck finding a decent way to tie everything together . However , considering this is my only gripe , then this is still a heck of a film - - one the kids AND parents can enjoy . Kids will love it and parents will actually not be bored - - a rare achievement in a film .
458957	2467618	404960	8.0	Is this a short film or a music video ?	This was included on the disk " Shorts : Volume 2 " - - a rather dull collection of short films . Shorts are among my favorite style of films but somehow the people assembling this second collection had a hard time finding quality content - - and it wasn't nearly as good as the first volume or other shorts collections . What makes this choice unusual for inclusion in the set is that I am not sure if this should be considered a short film or just a music video . My daughter recognized the video right away and said she thought all along it had just been a music video - - though it is one where you don't really see the singer - - just unusual visuals . As for the quality of the video performance , it was excellent - - the graphics were really neat and the song was funny in a very sick and twisted way . If you haven't guessed , it's all about using poison to murder people and it looks as if it was produced by the Addams Family ( the film version , not the nice TV Addams ' ) . Lovers of the weird and especially Goths will adore this film / video - - others , most likely , will find it too weird and creepy . See for yourself - - it is awfully clever .
461157	2467618	1127286	8.0	Well made	This is a very well made and interesting short film about the cultural gap between native-born Americans and Mexican immigrants - - as well as their common ground . A retired man is relaxing at home when he looks outside and sees a guy planting his rose bushes - - and he has no idea who this man is or why he's doing it . When he goes outside to talk to him , it's all a confusing mess because neither understands the language . At first he assumed his wife arranged for the man to do the work , but a phone call to her reveals that she also knows nothing about the guy . So , the wife calls a Hispanic friend and this lady talks to the Mexican man to figure out what's happening . It seems that he's a recent arrival in the country and simply wants to do anything to get a meal - - and perhaps if he plants the roses he'll get food . Well , the retired guy is shocked by how hard this man works , so he buys him lunch . Later , when the yard looks great , the Mexican man is gone - - it seems he assumed the lunch was payment for all the work . I was happy to see this was not an " evil American taking advantage of the poor Mexican film " - - and for hours the retired guy drove about town - - trying to find the man to pay him . It's a nice film and gives some nice insights into the experience of hard working Mexicans in a new land where they are all but lost . Well acted and directed .
463555	2467618	824301	8.0	Well , even if you do dislike it , it's less than 2 minutes out of your life !	This is a very imaginative and very short film . The best part about it is that even if you somehow dislike it ( and I doubt if you will ) , the whole thing is less than 2 minutes long , so it won't take a chunk out of your life - - you know , like watching THE LAST EMPEROR ( which seemed like 9 hours long ) . When the film begins , you can hear but not really see a group of guys chatting in a studio . They're in colorful clothes , but you can only vaguely see them . Then , when the director calls them to attention , they line up and make that loud high-pitched sound we hate when we see the color bars on the screen after a TV channel has gone off the air . These guys are apparently the " actors " who do this color band test pattern . It's pretty silly , I know , but well done .
463300	2467618	87188	8.0	I liked it , but the ending left me unsatisfied	This is one weird film - - and Fellini intended it to be . The plot doesn't seem all that important , but the " voyage " there is the substance of the film . A luxury liner is chartered by a group of rich admirers of a recently deceased opera diva . Their purpose is to bury her ashes at sea , but the actual burial only takes a very tiny portion of the film . Instead , the focus is on the journey itself and it is done in a combination of SLOW and artistic shot combined with a very surreal sensibility . Sometimes , the people move in a rhythmic fashion , while at others they break into VERY elaborate operatic numbers and the sets are NOT the least bit realistic at times but look more like art nouveau pieces of art . I particularly was captivated by the scene in which the rich travelers visit the boiler room and try to outdo each other in singing . It's just so strange yet compelling . I liked the film very much , but would certainly NOT want a steady diet of this type of movie . About the only thing I really hated was at the very end when the cameras panned back and showed the actual film crew and set . This completely took me out of the weird moment and seemed unnecessary - - I wanted to remain stuck in this strange world a little longer and hated to be reminded it was all a movie . This was , by the way , the same reaction I had at the ending to THE PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO .
462394	2467618	51622	8.0	The ONLY Fly movie you must see - - with a terrific ending to boot	Okay , up front you ought to know that I absolutely hated the remake of this film starring Jeff Goldbloom . I felt the remake had zero subtlety or charm and was just a special effects-laden and grotesque movie . If you care , look for my review of this film to see just how much I hated it ( and my hatred of this film is INTENSE ) . Probably so much of why I hated the disgusting remake was because the original film was everything the remake was not - - it was charming , low budget , effective and campy fun . The film is about a scientist who has a basement lab . He's working on a device to teleport things from one place to another ( kind of like a Star Trek transporter ) . It works great , but when he makes the trip himself , a fly buzzes into the chamber and the DNA of him and the fly become fused - - producing a human-sized creature with a giant fly head and arm ( it's so coooool when you finally see him without a sheet draped over his head , as he was during so much of the movie to avoid scaring his wife ) . Attempts to find the fly-sized creature with a human head and arm are totally unsuccessful , so eventual the fated scientist shoves himself into a press and squishes himself . The police suspect that this was just a murder , and they want to charge the scientist's wife . All looks bleak until the very final scene ( one of the most memorable ones in screen history ) when the detective hears a screaming fly calling for help - - just before it is devoured by a spider . You see a little human head and hear him screeching in a high pitched voice " HELP ME ! " . What a cool scene . The film also stars Vincent Price , who actually plays a normal person , not the bug-man . However , he does return for a sequel and you can guess what happens to Vincent in that one ! This is great campy fun - - a not to be missed film for horror movie fans .
458503	2467618	404032	8.0	Despite a couple poorly written performances , an excellent film that is NOT exploitational or even a horror film	I liked this movie a heck of a lot more than I thought I would , as I had little interest in seeing a horror film ( this just isn't a genre I enjoy most of the time ) . A lot of this was because the movie really wasn't a horror film per se , but a courtroom drama following the death of a supposedly possessed girl as well as a film that discusses the possibility of demonic possession - - though this is handled in a pretty ambiguous way and with no easy or pat answers . I could see people who say demonic possession can be explained away by natural phenomena AND those who believe in its existence both enjoying this interesting and thought-provoking film . It probably won't offend religious people nor will like likely offend others - - it's just a good film . It's even more interesting when you learn that the story is based on a real case , though artistic license was used in making this film ( just how much , I don't know ) . Despite an excellent script , excellent acting by the actress playing " Emily Rose " and a real creepy mood , there is one problem with the film and that is the acting by BOTH the prosecuting and defense attorney in the film . The prosecutor seemed too wooden , angry and unprofessional to be real and I truly doubt if his histrionics in the courtroom would have been tolerated by a sane judge . Likewise , the defense attorney , at times , seemed rather dumb and presented nearly as poor a case at the prosecutor . Plus , the average person probably could have done a better job than they did ! I really wonder if the writers ever consulted with real lawyers to find out how to create these roles - - they just were not believable and tended to detract from the rest of the film . Still , despite this serious complaint , this IS a good film - - though I really doubt if it's a good idea to let young kids see this due to the subject matter . Also , if you get a chance , see REQUIEM . This is a German-made version of the exact same case of Anneliese Michel - - the inspiration for both stories . Both are very good but have a much different focus .
463373	2467618	51365	8.0	a Bergman film that's not depressing or about death !	I've seen a lot of Ingmar Bergman films and sometimes I don't want to see one of his films about death or mental illness . Well , starting in the 1960s to the 1980s , these were the main themes of his movies , but in some of his earlier films , these are not so pervasive - - such as the movies The Devil's Eye ( a comedy ) and The Magician ( " Ansiktet " ) . Because of this , they may be more approachable to the average viewer who would balk at the much more serious tone of such classics as Through a Glass Darkly ( deep depression ) , Persona ( mental illness ) , Autumn Sonata ( repressed anger and abandonment ) , The Seventh Seal ( death and the plague ) or Fanny and Alexander ( child abuse and emotional neglect ) . The story is about a traveling group of hoaxters who put on a show combining magic and " animal magnetism " ( i . e . , an early name given to hypnosis ) . When they arrive at a Swedish town , they are forced to come to an audience with the local official and his cronies who want to prove that the act is a fraud . Bergman really doesn't try to resolve this issue , but instead shows how the town officials are really rather petty and mean people . How this traveling group deftly survives this encounter is the main focus of the movie . I especially liked the portion of the movie about the autopsy . It sounds gross , but I thought it was actually kind of funny . One of the officials is a cold and rather nasty doctor who longs for a chance to do an autopsy on the hypnotist . He gets far more than he bargains for - - that's all I really want to say - - otherwise it might ruin the suspense . So , overall I liked the movie . It was not great but well acted and not the least bit depressing .
460561	2467618	71141	8.0	excellent but with one glaring problem	There was so much I liked about this film and it's an interesting glimpse into the German psyche only three decades after WWII . I would have expected more tolerance and less outright bigotry considering the racism that lead to the holocaust . However , seething just beneath the surface was a lot of hostility towards the relationship between eh two main characters . Sure , some of it may have been due to the extreme age difference , but the vast majority of the hate spewed towards them seems like pure racism . I liked Fassbinder's choice of the female lead . She was FAR from the older but still beautiful lead played in the original picture . Briditte Mira is not even close to being as pretty or sophisticated as Jane Wyman . Instead , she kinda looked like my grandmother looked in 1975 . While this in some ways strained the credibility of the relationship ( and was personally kinda creepy for me ) , it was very refreshing to see an ordinary and not especially attractive woman falling in love . However , despite the originality injected into an older script , the movie had one major flaw . While it didn't ruin the film , it did take it from a 10 to an 8 in the rating . The character of Ali ( played by El Hedi ben Salem ) was practically a zombie through much of the film and showed almost no emotional range . His performance was far from just being underplayed . My wife thought perhaps he was portraying someone who was mentally retarded , though I don't think this was the intention . I would love to see a remake of this film - - updating the story and using a male lead who has something MORE than his age to offer . FYI - - a note to parents : there are several nude scenes and you get to see A LOT of Ali . Be aware of this when allowing your teens to view the film . If they were just edited out ( as they were not necessary for the plot ) , this would be a great film for teens as it brings up a lot of interesting topics for discussion .
461238	2467618	1740	8.0	A case of déjà vu !	Wow was I confused when I saw this movie from 1911 . I didn't recall having seen THE LONEDALE OPERATOR when I started the film , but soon after it started it was like a case of déjà vu . I KNEW I had seen the film before and even reviewed it on IMDb but I didn't remember it as being called ' THE LONEDALE OPERATOR ' . After a little checking , I found that the film I had seen was THE GIRL AND HER TRUST ( 1912 ) and the films were virtually identical . And , oddly enough , both are 17 minutes long ( though the speed at which the films are cranked may make this slightly longer or shorter ) . This really isn't too surprising , though , as when the film was made back in 1911 , outright plagiarism was common and pretty much condoned and many times the same production company would remake their films only a year or so later ! Often , the same film would be made by two or three or even more production companies - - sometimes even with the same movie title ! So it's very easy to understand the confusion . Now as for the film itself , it's a very good early full-length movie . Believe it or not , 17 minutes make this a very long film for 1911 - - as most films were less than five minutes long ! ! Because of its " great length " , the film has a good plot and is quite entertaining . Compared to other films of the age , it is a standout picture in practically every way .
462026	2467618	381382	8.0	Much better than the current IMDb rating	This film is included on a DVD entitled " Shorts : Volume Three " . Oddly , I have seen volume One already and Three is definitely much better - - though both are worth finding for lovers of short films like myself . I have no idea why this short currently is rated so poorly on IMDb , as it's very well made and funny - - though I will admit it is also pretty odd ! Two friends are driving and are discussing the Star Wars movies . While neither would probably admit it , they are both major geeks and are arguing over the stupidest points . I had to laugh because I've met folks like this and the internet abounds with them . However , things get funnier and weirder as their argument gets worse and worse - - leading to the guys fighting like a couple kids and worse ! I don't want to reveal much more , as it might spoil the film . However , the film makers did a good job of creating a cute vignette . While some may balk at how open-ended and ill-defined the film is ( it's more like a snippet than a full narrative ) , I loved the silliness and absurdity of it all . I want to see more from these folks .
459069	2467618	70707	8.0	very stupid , well-polished fun	Woody Allen's previous efforts , BANANAS and TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN , were exceptionally funny but very uneven films . His being a bit of an amateur in the film business is pretty obvious in these movies . However , by the time he created SLEEPER , he was a lot more polished and consistent film maker . While this is still a very stupid and sophomoric film , it is very funny nevertheless . While there are occasionally bad moments ( such as the giant chicken ) , they are very few and the humor just keeps hitting you again and again . I particularly liked the Orgazmatron and the history lesson he gives the futuristic professors . This film is slapstick and dopey - - exactly the type of film that intellectuals ( the audience for most later Allen films ) will probably hate . This is Allen for the common man - - back when he used to be very funny .
461672	2467618	33028	8.0	Sort of Like CAPTAIN BLOOD II	Although Brenda Marshall plays the female lead instead of Olivia DeHavilland , the two movies seem very similar as they are both taken VERY LOOSELY from Raphael Sabatini novels and involve piracy . CAPTAIN BLOOD was Flynn's breakout film - - making him a major star and in general it was a better film . Now this isn't knocking THE SEA HAWK - - it was also a very fine film but just not quite as good as the other . In this movie , Flynn plays a man like Francis Drake , as he is a privateer for England during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I . " Privateer " is a nice way of saying " legalized pirate " , as he and his crew were given permission to attack ships belonging to England's enemies , though they were not at war . In the film ( as in real life ) , the queen would scold Flynn for his evil deeds then divide up the treasure in private - - a nice arrangement for everyone ( except the Spanish , of course ) . Naturally , the Spanish don't like this treachery and so they conspire with Catholics in England to do naughty things - - only to be thwarted in the end by good ol ' Errol ( huzzah ) . This is a wonderful adventure with plenty of high seas action , a dandy romance and all the usual Warner Brother trappings given to an A-picture . Any serious student of film should see this movie . PS - - I have always found it odd how in these American movies England is always shown very positively but Spain isn't - - making stealing from them and killing their sailors seem okay .
462172	2467618	438105	8.0	Yet another brilliant CG film from Blur Studios	Although not seen as one of " the big boys " like Pixar , Dreamworks or Fox , tiny little Blur Studios is making a big name for itself with some tremendous short films . Not only did they make the Academy Award nominated film GOPHER BROKE , but they made some films which I think are even better , such as A GENTLEMEN'S DUEL . IN THE ROUGH is one of their earlier works , though it is every bit as beautifully rendered as their other films - - as pretty as anything by the big name studios . Unlike the competition , though , the films of Blur have all been shorts . Given the quality and fun I've seen in them , I really hope they one day try a full-length film or at least keep putting out more of these lovely shorts . IN THE ROUGH is about a caveman who is in the midst of an argument with his mate . Their language is gibberish to us , but it's pretty easy to guess what is occurring . After he leaves the cave , our hero comes upon a huge and nasty beast that tries to eat him - - leading to a cute conclusion where he not only defeats the creature but wins back his lady's love . Excellent animation and fun - - give this one a try .
461793	2467618	50356	8.0	Not exactly DAS BOOT , but still a very good sub warfare film	I was pretty torn on scoring this film - - if possible , I'd like to have given it a 7 . 5 . The film is one of the better sub warfare films , though now that I think about it , practically every sub film I have seen ( except for CRIMSON SKIES ) was excellent . There's something about this genre that make it easy to make a tense and engaging film . This movie is a tad different than most for two big reasons - - it gives an in-depth portrayal of BOTH the sub and the pursuing destroyer , and the film lacks a clichéd " happy ending " like some earlier sub films . Robert Mitchum is the new captain of the sub and his portrayal and that of his crew is a tad superficial - - Mitchum is pretty much all business . Instead , " meatier " roles are given to Curt Jurgens , Theodore Bikel and the rest of the German crew . Jurgens plays a tired older captain who is concerned with doing his duty , while also having grave doubts about his insane government . The movie is basically a cat and mouse type film that ultimately has a very strange and yet interesting conclusion . You will probably NOT guess how it all ends , and for that reason in particular , I liked this film .
458925	2467618	122459	9.0	a highly underrated " chick flick " that guys will also enjoy	I have never understood why this film wasn't more popular or why it's score on IMDb is so mediocre . There is so much going for this film , it's a wonder ! While I will admit that the plot itself is a bit contrived , in most " chick flicks " you are expected to suspend disbelief , so this isn't a big problem . Just think about SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLit has a GREAT reputation and is at least as contrived and was , to me , a less entertaining film . David Duchovney is very happily married when his wife unexpectedly dies . Her heart is transplanted into the sickly Minnie Driver who now has a new lease on life . Later , Driver and Duchovney meet and fall in love - - and then find out about their odd connection ! While of course the plot is odd , it is carried off so well and the romance is so sweet , it still works . PLUS , the best aspect of the movie that make it so precious and entertaining is the wonderful supporting cast . Carol O'Conner , Robert Logia and other old guys play Minnie's father and his friends and they are just too wonderful ! Their lives and adventures as they spend all that time at Minnie's home is just so much fun to watch - - you can't help but love the old guys and believe that their love for Minnie is deep and true . See it yourself with someone you love - - you won't be disappointed .
463674	2467618	351817	9.0	A very different sort of Samurai movie	TWILIGHT SAMURAI is a film that will no doubt disappoint some viewers . For people wanting lots of sword fighting and action , it has just two brief fight scenes . For people who like a fast-paced film , it will also be a let down because the film is over two hours long and has a very slow and deliberate pace . Nonetheless , I strongly enjoyed it and thought it one of the better Japanese films I've seen in quite some time . The reason I particularly enjoyed it is that it had a very realistic plot . While films such as THE SEVEN SAMURAI and the ZATOICHI series are fun and abound with great action , the real life of Samurai during the era just before the Meiji dynasty ( about 1850 ) were not like Samurai you'd see in other movies . The fact that Seibei Iguchi is a Samurai AND a glorified accountant is more true to the mundane nature of most of these swordsmens ' lives . Additionally , you find a depth in this humble lower-level Samurai than you'd find in most other films of the genre . Despite the stereotype , he'd much rather avoid a fight and takes his greatest pleasure in life being with his family . He is not involved in intrigues and macho posing but is instead a man very content with his simple lot in life . Because of this , you'll very likely find yourself really caring about the guy and hurting for him when his life is in turmoil . You also feel horribly for him because he cannot have the woman he loves . Exceptional acting , great direction , a lovely script and amazing fight scenes ( though brief - - the first one really is amazing ) - - this is a wonderful film that justifiably was nominated for the Best Foreign Film Oscar . Unfortunately , the winning film that year , BARBARIAN INVASIONS , was even better - - I know , I've seen both films . Still , losing to this wonderful French-Canadian film is nothing to be ashamed of in the least !
460270	2467618	34881	9.0	a hidden little gem	Veronica Lake and Cecil Kellaway are witches who have been sealed up in a tree for about 300 years . They are NOT nice witches and are thrilled when a bolt of lightning shatters the tree and releases them to do evil ! The first thing they want to do is destroy the descendants of the man who persecuted them during the witch trials . His most direct descendant is Frederick March and he is about to marry the woman he loves . So , Veronica plans on meeting him and placing a love potion in his drink so he becomes attracted to her instead - - with the intention of then dumping him and leaving him miserable . Of course , being a comedy , she accidentally drinks the potion and falls head over heels for March ! The acting is excellent ( particularly Kellaway who is uncharacteristically EVIL in this movie ) and the writing superb in the short little picture .
461307	2467618	52993	9.0	an exceptional western	Although I don't generally like Westerns , I have reviewed quite a few on IMDb . That's because although this is a tired and unoriginal genre in general , when it is original and offers something worth seeing , I take notice ! This is not my favorite Western , but it's in my list of top 10 . However , I would not put Kirk Douglas ' and Anthony Quinn's other Western movie Gunfight at the OK Corral on this list , as this famous fight has been beaten like a dead horse ! Too many movies glamorizing an insignificant event in US history until the true story is completely lost ! No , this movie differs because it somehow takes a familiar formula but makes it seem new and unique . Not the same old stuff , that's for sure ! The movie starts with a rape and murder or Marshall Kirk Douglas ' wife . He finds out that one of the men responsible is the son of an old friend . The old friend , Quinn , is a big shot in a nearby town and seemingly he is above the law . It's obvious that bringing Junior to account for his sins will not be easy ! See the rest of the film to see how this is resolved , and to see brilliant writing and acting . A few other exceptional Westerns I recommend because of excellent writing and because they have something original to say : The Big Country , The Gunfighter , Yellow Sky , Hondo , The Ox-bow Incident and The Fastest Gun Alive .
461834	2467618	53226	9.0	an exceptional film	This movie is about a poor English man who wants to claw his way to the top in the business world . To do this , he insinuates himself to the boss ' daughter , while at the same time having an affair with a married woman who is 10 years his senior ! Despite his being a sleazebag , of sorts , he has genuine feelings for this older lady and wants to marry her . However , at the same time events around him conspire to prevent this - - ultimately leading to tragedy . The reason I liked this film so much is that despite Lawrence Harvey's character being a scheming jerk , he is not 100 % despicable and you can understand a lot of his anger and desire to move up the social scale . Several times during the movie , he meets people who think they are better than him simply by virtue of their family background or position at the company . All these work together to produce a gritty , somewhat sleazy drama that seems plausible and definitely holds your attention .
462581	2467618	404869	9.0	a great accompaniment to the DVD set	The DVD set Warner Brothers released for THE GOLD RUSH was fantastic - - giving both the original release , the re-release ( including narration by Chaplin ) and this documentary about the making of the film . It gives a lot of amazing inside information and greatly enhances the film - - unlike the " extras " in most DVDs ( that often seemed more like a tacked-on element at best ) . In particular , I liked how it discussed the creation of the huge sets as well as the extreme difficulties they faced filming the on-site shots in the Sierra Nevadas . This movie is a must for film buffs and lovers of the work of Chaplin . Watch the movie then be sure to watch this featurette - - it helps bring the movie alive .
459326	2467618	36323	9.0	an excellent and under-appreciate was film	This film goes beyond the standard WW2 war film due to excellent writing and acting . Of course , due to the propaganda needs of the time ( it was filmed during the war ) , it included an incredibly diverse and multinational cast of heroes in order to bolster the war effort at home . It seem unlikely that such a diverse group of soldiers would have actually fallen together like they did in the movie , but that can easily be forgiven . Plus , the characterizations of the gungho evil Nazi prisoner and the war weary and decent Italian soldier are designed for to further the war effort at home . But , because it's so well done , you'll excuse these overly stereotypical roles . Especially since everything else works together so well . The plot is simple - - following a battle , diverse allied troops happen together to form a small company in search of the rest of their armies AND to find water ( since after all , it is in the North African desert ) . Along the way , they stumble upon the German uber-Nazi and Italian soldiers who they take prisoner . Eventually , they find some water at an ancient deserted fortress and then they wait , . . . . . What happens next , you'll have to see for yourself . The plot has some really nice twists and you'll really grow to care about these men and their plight . This is a Bogart film but he is so ably assisted it's hard to just characterize it has HIS film .
463328	2467618	71484	9.0	What's that saying about " best intentions " ? !	This is a very simply animated film that really struck a chord with me . Instead of the usual lousy animation that the 1970s were known for , this one was very different - - mostly because of exceptional writing and narration . It is the ultimate story about irony and the importance of just minding your own business ! The story is something like this : There was a simple family that lived on a small island in New England and they were very happy . Although they didn't have much , they were well-fed and content . Then , out of the blue , the idiots on the mainland got the idea that this family needed help - - after which , every possible problem occurred and left the viewer with the impression that the expression about " the road to Hell is paved with good intentions " is 100 % true - - at least in this case ! Filled with irony and sarcasm , this short sponsored by The Film Board of Canada is a winner and deserved its nomination for the Oscar for Best Animated Short Film . My only question , then , is - - is this a true story ? I sure hope not ! !
460200	2467618	1527	9.0	Pretty weird . . . but also pretty amazing	Believe it or not , at 12 minutes , this film ( for 1912 ) is a full-length film . Very , very few films were longer than that back then , but that is definitely NOT what sets this odd little film apart from the rest ! No , what's different is that all the actors ( with the exception of one frog ) are bugs . . . yes , bugs ! This simple little domestic comedy could have looked much like productions starring the likes of Chaplin , Laurel and Hardy or Max Linder but instead this Russian production uses bugs ( or , I think , models that looked just like bugs ) . Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy were yet to be discovered and I assume Linder was busy , so perhaps that's why they used bugs ! Using stop-motion , the bugs moved and danced and fought amazingly well - - and a heck of a lot more realistically than King Kong 21 years later ! The film starts with Mr . Beetle sneaking off for a good time . He goes to a bawdy club while his wife supposedly waits at home . But , unfortunately for Mr . Beetle , he is caught on camera by a local film buff . Plus , he doesn't know it but Mrs . Beetle is also carrying on with a bohemian grasshopper painter . Of course , there's a lot more to this domestic comedy than this , but the plot is age-old and very entertaining for adults and kids alike . Weird but also very amazing and watchable .
461737	2467618	157503	9.0	exceptionally funny and exceptionally silly	Leonard Maltin hated this movie and instead he recommended watching the movie SMILE ( 1975 ) . Well , I would say the exact opposite - - DROP DEAD GORGEOUS is hilarious ( though not exactly subtle ) and SMILE is a not particularly good comedy ( though it was original ) . As I said above , the movie wasn't subtle but a very silly and completely over-the-top look at Junior Miss-type pageants . Ellen Barkin does a great job of playing " trailer trash " and Kirstie Alley plays the rich broad who feels she IS the pageant . Both actresses were not particular favorites of mine , but this movie helped changed my opinion as they did great jobs and really stayed in character . Kirsten Dunst and Denise Richards headlined the small cast of girls competing for the local Minnesota pageant - - the winner of which will go to the state championship . What happens along the way has got to be seen to be believed ! If I told you in this review , it would reveal too much . This movie is strongly recommended if you just want a good laugh . If you want cerebral comedy , this is not it ! The only negative is the very strong language , so parents are recommended to consider this before showing it to younger kids .
459702	2467618	105695	9.0	Did it deserve the Best Picture Oscar ? ! Probably not - - but it still is a very dandy picture !	I really liked this film but can't see exactly why it won the Oscar for Best Picture , though I gotta admit that none of the nominated films really stand out in my mind . In a way , it would have been interesting if they'd given out no award in that category , though that will never happen . Now I am not saying I disliked the film . It was exceptional - - just not exactly " great " - - especially when there were other Clint Eastwood Westerns before this that were about as good or better . Maybe this is a lot like the film TRUE GRIT . Not a super Western , but John Wayne got the Best Actor Oscar more because of his amazing body of work BEFORE this film than the film itself . What the movie does excel at is creating an aura of an " anti-hero " style Western . Not one where you exactly hated all the characters , but one that calls their motivations and actions to question and asks a lot of questions about what makes a hero . And , in this light , several of the characters really stand out in my mind . The most intriguing is Gene Hackman as the sheriff , Little Bill . He is not the typical sheriff-type character . He is neither the consummate hero or an inept jerk that looks the other way when trouble comes - - the two most common types of sheriffs in film . Instead , he is a very pragmatic sadist . Pragmatic because he NEVER faces his enemies alone , but always has a well-trained gang to support him - - like most bullies . And , with this gang giving him the upper hand , he show that down deep he is a sick and twisted man who takes pleasure in torment . I also liked the young punk gunman ( Jaimz Woolvett ) . At first , he was very annoying and brash , but that really helped in the development of his character . He reminded me a lot of the guy Richard Jaekel played in THE GUNMAN - - a young punk trying to prove his masculinity with a gun ( wow , Freud would have LOVED that symbolism ) . But , unlike Jaekel , he eventually showed a very likable and believable bit of humanity . Clint Eastwood was also not the same typical character he usually played . Not " the man with no name " like so many Spaghetti-Westerns , but a complex and cold man who used to be a drunken # @ $ % ! & but had reformed when he met the right woman . Then , years later , when he strapped his guns on again , it was pretty unusual and refreshing to see what a bad shot he initially was and how much trouble this old man had getting on the horse . This old and somewhat broken-down tough-guy was also reminiscent of John Wayne's last film , THE SHOOTIST , in that although the body is achy and tired , there is still a lot of man hidden underneath . Morgan Freeman's role was very ordinary and he shows once again that he is a supremely capable actor . The best part about the role was that not once did anyone mention that he was a black man - - a bold move in many ways . Instead , he and his quiet dignity was what was front and center . Richard Harris and the rest of the cast did fine jobs and I have no complaints about the acting . In fact , I have no real complaints at all about the film . The movie deserves its R-rating for graphic language and a lot of extreme violence , though it is not as graphic or offensive as many similarly rated films . With a parent , this might be appropriate for some teens , though you should think twice before letting them watch .
463028	2467618	86373	9.0	Brilliant ! ! ! This movie actually made me LOVE Shakespeare !	I never liked Shakespeare when I was a student . I found it boring and long-winded . However , after seeing this movie I realize that the Bard was a genius , as this movie is ( believe it or not ) a modern re-working of HAMLET ! In fact , the first time I saw the movie , I didn't even realize this . It was only the second time , I began putting things together ( the name " Elsinore " for the brewery as well as the basic plot when you subtract Doug and Bob from the equation ) . In fact , I would say this is far BETTER than Shakepeare . Who wants to hear " alas , poor Yorik I knew him , . . . . " or see a crazed Ophelia when instead you can see a flying dog and maniacal hockey players ? Brilliant ! I only wish Doug and Bob had taken on other dull literary favorites and converted them to modern Canadian classics ! A must see for all weird movie buffs .
458372	2467618	808209	9.0	I bet you haven't seen a film as weird as this before !	Sam and Gus are a strongman and his promoter with the sideshow . However , they begin to hear that there is a stronger strongman named " Crooked Mick " and they are determined to find out if it's true . Sam ( the strongman ) is particularly eager to see if there's anyone stronger than him - - and based on what you've seen of his abilities so far , this doesn't seem possible ! ! As they go off in search of Crooked Mick , you'll notice that there's a lot of excellent CGI work and the countryside looks a little more like Oz than Australia ! In fact , the story goes from weird to weirder as it progresses - - so weird that you just can't stop watching ! ! The movie has a very professional quality about it and there's little not to love , though the film's ending wasn't quite as big a laugh as I might have hoped . There still is an awful lot to like about this very silly film .
463024	2467618	120483	9.0	BRILLIANT and overlooked	Although this movie is not quite as funny as What About Bob , I think this is probably Bill Murray's second funniest film , though I strongly doubt if it will be enjoyed as much by the average viewer . That is because , I hate to say , the " average viewer " often is a teenager or adult who likes their comedy very broad and simple . No , this will not appeal to fans of Porky's or Little Nicky because it requires the viewer to have a reasonable attention-span and the ability to enjoy a comedy that doesn't telegraph what will happen next ( just how many movies these days are hard to predict anyways ? ) . The movie is a screwy , difficult to describe spy adventure where everyone knows just how deadly the stakes are - - - except for Bill Murray's character . He mistakenly thinks everything that is happening around him is a type of performance art ( sort of a Theatre of the Absurd ) . You MUST watch it .
459965	2467618	72431	9.0	Not Mel Brooks ' best film , but pretty close	The career of Mel Brooks is much like that of Woody Allen in that both of them did their best stuff in their earlier years when their films were just plain funny . After a few films , Allen's got too introspective and artsy and Brooks ' became so juvenile and cheap that both " geniuses " became intolerable to watch to many past fans . Young Frankenstein is one of Brooks ' earliest films and like THE PRODUCERS ( his first and best ) , it is so hilariously funny that I don't mind seeing them again and again . So why did I like YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN , exactly ? Well , the acting was superb . I particularly loved Gene Wilder ( particularly during his speech while holding a scalpel ) and his sidekick , Marty Feldman , . . . though Cloris Leachman was also terrific as Frau Blücher . And while the film lacked the subtlety and grace of THE PRODUCERS , it was silly and dopey but still restrained compared to later Brooks films . Plus , it had a lovely black & white look that really was a wonderful homage to the Universal monsters of the 1930s . I know this will ruffle a lot of feathers , but his equally famous BLAZING SADDLES was , for me , the beginning of the end of Brooks ' genius . While SADDLES had many wonderful moments , there was absolutely no restraint and the end degenerated into a horrific and stupid mess . Like Jerry Lewis , after a while his films were practically unwatchable , as there was no one on-hand to say " enough " or " perhaps you might want to make this scene a little more subtle " or " doing a comedy about homeless people just can't work " .
463108	2467618	120586	9.0	exceptionally powerful drama - - but not for the kids	I really appreciated how those associated with this excellent film refused to pull any punches in showing the life of a young skin-head so ably portrayed by Edward Norton . Instead of creating a caricature of a racist , all the vile language and violence is shown . This DEFINITELY makes this a movie NOT for KIDS , but for adults it makes a strong impact - - like a right cross into the jaw ! Now I know some adults will also be completely turned off by this as well , but considering how slimy and awful racism is , how can you talk about it other than by exposing it as it really is ? ! I applaud the efforts , though I must also admit it can VERY hard to watch - - particularly the shooting scene and the intensely graphic language .
462073	2467618	436071	10.0	It's amazing , but how can you exactly rate this or compare it to ?	I only happened upon this IMDb citation by mistake , as I assumed that it was not listed on IMDb . This is because this direct to DVD production isn't really a movie or TV show and it's almost impossible to describe it adequately - - you just need to see it for yourself . This film was a project of some amazing computer programmers and musicians . Wonderful acoustic music with a modern ethereal quality was written and recorded - - then set to the most amazing computer visuals . It was so well done that the first time I saw one of the segments ( PBS here in Florida periodically show them as time filler ) , I thought perhaps the machine in the video was real . I kept staring and staring - - trying to figure out what was and wasn't real ! It was amazing and breathtaking . I teach at an arts school and have used this as time filler on occasion as well . And in so many cases , these young people who watch it respond by saying that they would LOVE to one day work for the Animusic people . It truly inspired them . By the way , if you like this , there is a second DVAnimusic 2 . It's not quite as good as the first , though a few of the segments are absolutely amazing . I'd give this second DVD a 9 ( I particularly loved the Robots ) and recommend you see and buy both !
461704	2467618	51201	10.0	Dynamite courtroom drama	This is one of the absolute best courtroom movies ever made , along with ANATOMY OF A MURDER and THE VERDICT . All deserve a score of 10 and each is great in it own way . This film is great , but not for the realism of ANATOMY OF A MURDER . Instead , it's got such a wonderful script full of wonderful twists and turns . Plus , having top actors on the top of their game ( such as Charles Laughton , Tyrone Power and Marlena Dietrich ) made this such a great film . Plus , it has one of the best all-time endings on film . So is it realistic ? Hardly , but given the magnificent script , this can easily be forgiven and just be enjoyed for the massive entertainment value it brings . If you don't enjoy this film , you must be dead !
462169	2467618	141963	10.0	This is an amazing film - - why haven't we heard more about it ? !	This film is about a true hero . A seemingly ordinary man that chose to do the right thing even at the risk of his own life . Like Oskar Schindler and John Rabe , Sempo Sugiwara actively worked to save as many lives as he could during mass genocide . While not the safe or expedient thing to do , these men did what they did because they had to act - - to do anything to save the few innocents that they could during the 1930s and 40s . Schindler , you've most likely heard about as it was chronicled in the great Steven Spielberg film SCHINDLER'S LIST . Rabe and Sugiwara's stories are a bit different . Today they are still largely forgotten - - especially in their home countries . Rabe was a Nazi official in Nanking , China who risked his own life in 1937 to save countless thousands of Chinese peasants from massacre by a rampaging Japanese army . Sempo Sugiwara was a minor Japanese diplomat in Lithuania who risked his life and career writing 2000 exit visas for Jews fleeing the German invasion - - even after his own government warned him not to . This almost thirty minute film tells the extremely touching story of Sugiwara's crusade to save as many as he could before he was ultimately relocated to another post . While the embassy reportedly averaged 300 visas a month , Sugiwara wrote that many each day until eventually 6000 unwanted Jews were allowed to escape annihilation . The story is told very simply and with great deftness . Considering that the film was made by two men with very limited experience in the field ( Chris Tashima and Tom Donaldson ) , it's a truly amazing film that had me in tears . Considering that this film is brilliantly executed , it's no surprise that this film ended up winning an Academy Award . A truly exceptional film - - - so why is it rated so poorly on IMDb ? ! ? ! ?
463491	2467618	228392	10.0	a wonderful follow-up to The House Without a Christmas Tree	The same cast that had previously appeared in the made for TV movie THE HOUSE WITHOUT A Christmas TREE was reunited for this Thanksgiving movie . They seemed to have picked up without a hitch . This one focuses on the feud between two incredibly stubborn old farts - - Jason Robards and Barnard Hughes . Apparently , Robards had dug a pond for Hughes and had never been paid and they'd been arguing back and forth about it for some time . Robards ' daughter , Addie , has her curiosity peaked by all this and bicycles by Hughes farm after school one day . There , she discovers he has a horse in need of care . Despite the NO TRESPASSING signs and his repeated threats , she approaches him and offers to take care of the horse if he lets her ride it . All this is done WITHOUT telling her father . Later , she feels sorry for Hughes as he is all alone and the holidays are approaching . When she asks her father if Hughes can come for Thanksgiving , she is told a loud and firm NO ! So , she has her dinner and sneaks a plate to her new friend . What happens next is best for you to see for yourself . The movie is so real and poignant , you can't help but fall under its spell .
