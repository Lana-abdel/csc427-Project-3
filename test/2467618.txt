459023	2467618	70248	1.0	Reason # 253 to hate the 1970s	JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEAGULL is a film about a bird and his philosophical musings . As he flies about , he wonders if there's more to life than just eating fish heads , how high he can fly and is there some special purpose to life - - all in a live-action two-hour film ! Yes , this is # 253 of why you should hate the 1970s - - right between the song " Muskrat Love " and Richard Nixon ! Okay , there really is no such list - - but if there was , this film would be on it ! That's because this is a god-awful film that was actually embraced by " with it " people and made the book a huge best-seller and the film a must-see . And to make it worse , the film is so deadly serious and tries so hard to be philosophical - - while all it really consists of is a seagull flying about as inane dialog blares on the screen . Could this get any worse ? ! Well , yes , because while the music does sound lovely , Neil Diamond also sings several songs that made " Heartlight " ( sure to be included if there was a " reasons to hate the 1980s " list ) seem hard-edged ! So what positive things do I have to say about the film ? Well , the cinematography is lovely and must have been spectacular on the big screen . Also , when Neil Diamond isn't singing , the music is lovely . However , with two hours to the film , these reasons become irrelevant after just a few minutes as the rest is just a ponderous pile of . . . . well , . . . guano . And the fact that so many once-respected actors LOVED the project and agreed to do voices for it is a testament to the power of mood altering drugs and hippie psychology ! ! Harry Medved included this in his book " The Fifty Worst Films of All Time " . While I have disagreed with some of his choices , I can heartily agree that this film merited , no DEMANDED , inclusion ! In summation , I'd rather eat glass than see it again ! It's THAT bad ! ! !
460955	2467618	86250	1.0	Unrelentingly vile	I am sure that I'll probably get some nasty emails about this one , but I think SCARFACE might just be one of the worst movies of the last 25 years - - - especially since it is so adored by so many and been so readily accepted as a " great film " . It is supposed to be an updated remake of the classic film of the same name from 1932 ( starring Paul Muni ) . Despite this , the movie is sloppy and cheap . Instead of good writing and intelligent film-making , they hired Oliver Stone to write a hackneyed film . The result is a deliberate assault on the sensibilities by using the f-word again and again as well as using extreme and pointless violence throughout . It's easy to say " f - - - " and the like and it's easy to have millions spent for special effects explosions and gunfire , but these alone do not constitute a good film , as the writing was almost absent in the film and it was just a giant over-the-top parody of gangster films . It's as if DePalma's mantra for the film is " when in doubt , have Pacino say the f-word or have him kill some people " . Also , while some have praised Al Pacino's performance , to me it seemed like ridiculous self-parody - - like a dirty version of the guy he played in DICK TRACy - - which , at least , was SUPPOSED to be a cartoon . None of his brilliance from THE GODFATHER is present , as he plays a buffoon . There is absolutely no subtlety , no finesse and nothing of value in the film . In fact , and I know this will again prompt some nasty emails , I really think the film is intended for a stupid and undemanding audience who actually get off on this sort of brain-rot . Avoid this like the plague - - your brain will thank you for this ! Ed Wood , Jr . could have made a much better film had he been given this budget .
460076	2467618	88885	1.0	There are so many better and less annoying kids films out there	Call me a curmudgeon , but I absolutely hate the Care Bears and wish they had never been created . They are , without a doubt , the most saccharine and bland characters created in the last 30 years . So sweet , so nice that you really wish that there was a movie that paired them with Itchy and Scratchy ! ! ! Now I am not really saying I want the really little kids out there to see ultra-violent films , but there gets to be a point when a film is so non-offensive and sweet that it nearly puts the viewers in a diabetic coma ! This means , parents , that if you are suckered into watching this with your kids , you are in for a trip to Hades ! I just can't see how any sane adult could stand watching these horrid creatures for more than about 20 seconds . On top of these complaints , the animation quality is poor and the script is so mindless and insipid that ANYTHING must be better for the kids to watch . This stuff makes the Teletubbies look edgy !
459583	2467618	333074	1.0	only to be viewed by masochists !	This was a thoroughly disgusting and pointless film that only fatheads with an inflated sense of self-importance could watch and then praise . The movie is filled with disgusting images , sleaze and human bile - - something I would never hope to see again . Were these sentiments strong enough to hopefully keep you from seeing this film - - - I sure hope so ! My thorough disgust for the film isn't because it shows the lowest elements of Brazilian society - - after all , I was quick to praise films like CITY OF GOD and CENTRAL STATION - - and these films were violent and scary . However , their portrayals of the violence and cheapness of life in the lowest social strata were meant to be eye-opening and document the horrors - - not provide a voyeuristic chamber of horrors meant only to turn our stomachs . I won't even begin to describe all the viscerally vile images from MANGO YELLOW - - partly because they make me ill just thinking about it and partly because I could only take the movie to a certain point , then I made myself get up and turn it off ! In addition , the film is strongly anti-Christian and pro-filth - - so it tries at the onset to alienate much of its audience . I worry about the types of people who CAN watch this film all the way through and it DOESN'T nauseate them ! AVOID it at all costs . If you want a similar experience , go to a slaughterhouse ( it's in the film ) or stare at feces ( it's also in the film and is apparently eaten by one of the scum in the film ) . Thorough garbage .
460809	2467618	3679	1.0	not worth your time , . . .	In 1914 , Charlie Chaplin began making pictures . These were made for Mack Sennett ( also known as " Keystone Studios " ) and were literally churned out in very rapid succession . The short comedies had very little structure and were completely ad libbed . As a result , the films , though popular in their day , were just awful by today's standards . Many of them bear a strong similarity to home movies featuring obnoxious relatives mugging for the camera . Many others show the characters wander in front of the camera and do pretty much nothing . And , regardless of the outcome , Keystone sent them straight to theaters . My assumption is that all movies at this time must have been pretty bad , as the Keystone films with Chaplin were very successful . The Charlie Chaplin we know and love today only began to evolve later in Chaplin's career with Keystone . By 1915 , he signed a new lucrative contract with Essenay Studios and the films improved dramatically with Chaplin as director . However , at times these films were still very rough and not especially memorable . No , Chaplin as the cute Little Tramp was still evolving . In 1916 , when he switched to Mutual Studios , his films once again improved and he became the more recognizable nice guy - - in many of the previous films he was just a jerk ( either getting drunk a lot , beating up women , provoking fights with innocent people , etc . ) . The final evolution of his Little Tramp to classic status occurred in the 1920s as a result of his full-length films . Apart from one or two moments , this film has little to offer other than guys slugging each other and mistreating women . No laughs - - just amateurish crap by today's standards .
458689	2467618	780536	2.0	A film loved by many and offensive to many more	WARNING - - The language in this review is like the language in the movie - - just not gratuitous ! Colin Farrell plays an assassin who is pretty much like ' Father Dougal ' from the " Father Ted " television series , though he also is sadistic and thoroughly unlikable and obnoxious . Brendan Gleeson ( from the Oscar-winning short SIX SHOOTER ) plays a less obnoxious murderer . These are the two " funny " heroes of this film . According to IMDb " The word ' fuck ' and its derivatives are said 126 times in this 107-minute film , an average of 1 . 18 ' fucks ' per minute " . To me , this combined with the fact that the leading men are assassins , is more than enough reason to hate this film . While at times it seemed pretty clever and even interesting , I found everyone so repellent and stupid that I just couldn't stick with the film . Life is too short to watch crude films like this and I hate films where there is no one to care about at all . Although this film IS in the IMDb top 250 , I can assume that this is a film you'll either love or hate - - but probably mostly love . If you are a rather traditional guy like me , you'll be irritated by the sloppiness of injecting the f-word into every other sentence and see it as not just offensive but poor writing . Any idiot can say obscenities again and again - - this isn't a sign of brilliance but of inadequacy and this seems to be the recent trend in other supposedly " great " films . And , making hateful heroes is a sure way to drive away many in the audience . Truly a film you either love or hate .
460246	2467618	70222	2.0	Who would have thought to combine horror with 70s soft-core porn ?	The plot involves women who somehow are part bee . They are sexually insatiable and when they mate with unsuspecting men , they cause their hearts to explode . This was a pretty creative but incredibly crappy movie . The production values are nil and the film really shows it , but there is also a cheesy quality that may appeal to some bad movie fans . I am definitely a bad movie fan ( loving such horrid films as PLAN9 FROM OUTER SPACE , THE APPLE and TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE ) , but I really got bored with the whole mess . Some of it might have been all the nudity - - I couldn't watch it with the family ( and it's fun to do this with a bad film ) and for lovers of skin , the ladies were often pretty skanky-looking - - as if they hired prostitutes or women they picked up at bus stations . By the way , William Smith , who stars in the film , ( and looks kind of like a guy just out of rehab ) is the same guy who later replaced Danny on HAWAII 5-0 . No wonder the show was soon canceled !
463057	2467618	70337	2.0	If they had just killed Bobby Van and eliminated the songs , I would have been a nice film . . .	. . but unfortunately no one thought about having Van killed in order to save this doomed production . The only positive thing about him in the film is his nice singing voice . . . too bad the songs are mostly insipid and sappy . Why did I hate Van so much ? Well , throughout the film he seemed like he was doing a third-rate Soupy Sales imitation - - with lots of mugging , bad jokes and way too much energy spent trying to make everyone laugh . The worst of these moments was when he was " teaching " the class - - these kids laughed at EVERYTHING he did . Heck , Van could have read the phone book or showed them autopsy photos and they probably would have laughed ! Now Van was not the only bad casting decision in the film - - he was just the most obvious . Of course , having John Gielgud ( a lovely actor ) play an Asian was ridiculous as well as having Michael York play Peter Finch's brother ! ! The bottom line is that because of these insane casting choices , the film was doomed from the start . . . . and the worst of them was the god-awful Bobby Van . Now in real life , he might have been a lovely person and it's sad that in real life he died so young , but with the material they gave him here I just wanted to rip out his tongue to get him to be quiet . Now I also mentioned the songs - - egad , those terrible songs ! ! The original LOST HORIZON by Frank Capra was a subtle delight throughout - - and not a single song and dance number in the film . So why did they decide to add a bazillion songs that did nothing to help the film ? They only served to make it seem like a gooey mess - - like the original DOCTOR DOOLITTLE combined with LOST HORIZON . The end result is a sickly sweet children's movie - - not one that can be enjoyed by anyone over 8 . Now if you can remove these problems , you have the basis of a decent film . After all , the plot is lovely and is still hidden beneath all the goo . Peter Finch is particularly good ( though certainly not the equal of Ronald Colman in the original ) . But , considering that the original was a near-perfect classic , why bother with this sticky confection . Who wants to wade through the treacle ? ! By the way , this film was included in " The 50 Worst Films " book by Harry Medved . While I , too , disliked the film , it wasn't bad enough to merit inclusion in the book . I think it was included mostly because it was such a huge box office failure and because it was released just a few years before the book appeared . An excellent book - - just not one of the best selections to the " hallowed hall " of dreck .
462558	2467618	104684	2.0	After a while , this becomes a very dull film , . . . . I mean how many senseless murders can you watch until you simply don't care anymore ? !	I love Asian films . However , after seeing this film , I have no desire to see any more films like this one . While the film generally has very positive reviews and a very good overall rating of 7 . 8 , this is probably very deceiving , as I ONLY think die-hard ultra-violent / ultra-action loving people would enjoy this type of film and they traditionally flock to John Woo films . The average non-violence junkie has probably never heard of Woo or if they have , have no interest in such extremely graphic and violent fare . The first twenty or so minutes of the film , I actually enjoyed , though , of course , the film WAS mega-violent . At least there was some style and some sense of purpose to the killing . However , after about 50 % of the movie was past , the rest of the film was one long , long , long extended scene of carnage . It was as if you took EVERY Rambo , Die-Hard , Death Wish and Steven Segal movie AS WELL AS THE KOREAN WAR AND WWII and combined them into one movie ! There is no possible way to keep count , but the number of good guys , bad guys and assorted innocent bystanders killed in the movie seems like it must top 1000 ( and this is NOT an exaggeration ) . Initially , this had a big impact on me , however , after a while it became downright boring . After all , how many dead people , fake blood and slow-motion death scenes can any NORMAL person take before they either turn off the film , get sick or become bored . The bottom line is this is a wonderful film if you really could care less about plot and just want 100 % carnage . Period . Oh , and the plot device of having all the babies in the middle of the firefight near the end just seemed like a cheap way to build excitement . I mean , think about it , one minute the hero is cuddling a baby and the next he blows away a few bad guys , then he nuzzles the little tyke . Is this meant to be tender or poignant ? ! Gimme a break . This movie is dumb and I really do wonder about the type of person who wants a steady diet of this . Okay , now feel free to hit me with all your " NOT HELPFUL " comments - - I am STILL right about this film ! By the way , although I hated the movie , I really want to get a gun like the heroes had . You know , the semiautomatic pistol that can fire 10 , 20 or even 30 times without needing to be reloaded ! ! And I want to find out where they got the hand grenades that when they blow up , they only injure bad guys - - even though the heroes might only be a couple feet away from the blast ! !
460140	2467618	70071	2.0	Frankly . . . far from fabulous .	This Oscar-winning animation is a giant headache and could easily be used by evil , repressive governments to torture and brainwash their people and is one of the best examples of a truly awful film that somehow won this award . While I can definitely appreciate the effort it took making this film ( cutting out thousands and thousands of magazine pictures to make collages ) , the problem is that it is so cacophonous . You see , the sound track consists of two alternate scripts being read CONSTANTLY throughout the film . Both narrators are the same person . One constantly repeats words starting with the F-sound while the other talks ad nauseum about his very dull life - - during which time these collages appear and disappear rapidly . The film has no commercial appeal whatsoever and is great for people who like artsy and pretentious film - - otherwise beware , as it's totally painful and annoying .
464441	2467618	51758	2.0	histrionic and awful performance	What was the academy thinking ? ! ! ! ? ? ! How could they have given Susan Hayward ( the Queen of Subtle ) the Oscar for BEST ACTRESS for this performance ? ! Since this occurred in the 1950s ( before widespread use of LSD ) , I assume the members must have been either blackmailed or just plain nuts ! The movie is about an incredibly obnoxious party-girl who is convicted of murder . Whether or not she really did it was a little unclear , but I wanted her executed anyway - - just to shut her up ! Ms . Hayward's performance is bad and WAY over-the-top . It's as if she's starring in a high school production ( and a rather poor one at that ) - - with loud bellowing , dramatics that appear more akin to epilepsy and the DUMB trademark " dice rolling " move she makes throughout the picture . I think Edward G . Robinson in drag would have been more believable in this role ! FYI - - I seem to be one of the only people I know who thinks Susan Hayward was a bad actress and I'm not sure why . Just as few of her stinker roles include : the red-headed Bortai in the classic ( ? ) The Conquerer , Bathsheba , and what's-her-face in Valley of the Dolls . Subtle she ain't . I wonder though , if perhaps some of Divine's histrionics in John Waters ' films MIGHT have been inspired by Miss Hayward's performance !
459952	2467618	53103	3.0	No wonder the Soviets hated America ! ! !	My giving this a score of 3 is NOT what I would give the original Soviet version of this film . It seems that American-International ( a studio that specialized in ultra-low-budget fare in the 60s ) bought this film and utterly destroyed it - - slicing a two hour plus film into a 64 minute film ! Plus , much of this 64 minutes was new material ( such as the " monsters " ) - - so you know that this film bears almost no similarity to the original . The original film appears to be a rather straight drama about the Soviet conquest of space - - though I really am not sure what it was originally ! For insight into the original film , read Steven Nyland's review - - it was very helpful . By the way , this was the third Soviet sci-film I've seen that American-International bought and then hacked apart to make a " new " film - - standard practice to a company that was willing to put just about anything on the screen to make a buck - - provided , of course , it didn't cost them much more than a buck in the first place ! ! This Americanized film was about two rival world powers ( NOT the US and Soviets ) trying to be the first to Mars . The tricky " bad guys " try but fail and the " good guys " rescue one of the idiot astronauts and then head to Mars . Unfortunately , they are temporarily stranded on a moon of Mars where they see some monsters ( added by American-International ) that are REAAAALLY cheesy and one does bear similarity to a certain part of a female's anatomy . Then , they are rescued - - returning to Earth heroes . The bottom line is that the film was butchered - - turning an incredibly beautiful piece of art ( for the time ) being turned into a grade-C movie . Because of this , the Soviets really had a reason to hate America ! I'm just shocked that the horrible job A-I did with this film didn't convince them to refuse to sell more films to these jerks ! It's worth a look for a laugh , but the really bad moments that make you laugh are few and far between . So , the film is a dud - - not bad enough to make it a must-see for bad movie buffs and too dopey to be taken seriously . I would really love to see this movie in its original form - - it must have been some picture .
461301	2467618	35777	3.0	Sadly , very bland indeed	For those fans of Laurel and Hardy , the 1940s and beyond were a very sad time for the team . Their contracts with Hal Roach Studios had expired and now they were " free agents " - - able to work for any studio who offered them a job . Unfortunately , Fox , RKO , MGM ( without Roach ) and even a French film company who hired the boys had absolutely no touch for their comedic talents . Plus , Stan and Ollie were a lot older and seeing these geriatric men taking pratfalls seemed sad , not particularly funny . Stan looked very ragged and Ollie's weight had ballooned up to the point where he could barely walk - - and so it made me feel uncomfortable laughing at their very , very sedate antics . In addition to their age , this particular film suffers because Fox Studios oddly cast them in a supporting role and created a parallel plot involving a young couple - - something that reduced their time on screen AND turned them into insipid " hangers on " instead of just being themselves . A cute and cuddly Stan and Ollie is very foreign to the old Laurel and Hardy of the 20s and 30s - - and just seemed awfully strange and suited them poorly . Now even with their age , this COULD have been a decent movie if it had been given decent writing and if it appeared the studio cared - - and it's quite obvious they were using the " B unit " here - - with , at best , second class support . In particular , there are very few laughs and the last 10 minutes of the film is simply dreadful - - relying exclusively on a sloppy rear-projected screen for the stupid chase scene - - which might just rank as one of the worst of its kind in film history . For mind-numbed zombie lovers of Laurel and Hardy , it's probably a film they will love . But , for lovers of the team who are willing to honestly evaluate this film relative to their amazing earlier films , it simply comes up wanting indeed . In fact , of all their full-length films pre-1940 , I can't think of one I liked less than DANCING MASTERS . Unfortunately , of the post-1940 films , this might just be one of their better ones . Sadly , it got a lot worse - - with wretched films like THE BIG NOISE and NOTHING BUT TROUBLE . I just wish the boys had just retired after SAPS AT SEA . Finally , I wonder if all the generally positive reviews for this film on IMDb might reflect the reviewers ' love of the team more than it's an indication that this is a good film ? For an audience who are NOT already in love with the team , I don't know HOW this film will do anything but bore the audience - - it certainly WON'T convince anyone that Laurel and Hardy were comedic geniuses . But even comedic geniuses need material worthy of their talents .
461466	2467618	749	3.0	odd and very dated - - but worth seeing for D . W . Griffith	Historically this is an important film as you get a chance to see D . W . Griffith as an actor before he became the world famous director . This is interesting indeed . Unfortunately , the film itself is pretty trite and silly and lasts only about five minutes . A little child is stolen by an obviously fake eagle that flaps its wings in VERY slow motion and it's up to the family to come to her rescue . They scale the cliff and find the child but are attacked by the stuffed bird - - at which point our hero beats it to submission and triumphs unscathed . By today's standards this is a piece of crap film . However , back in 1908 , this was a typical short film . Decent movies with higher production values and plots were still in the future ! Today , though , the movie only provides a unintended few laughs !
461335	2467618	52893	3.0	an important message tarnished by goofy film techniques	Although the purpose of this film was to denounce the use of nuclear weapons , I so hated the style of the film that the message was largely lost on me . While I loved some of the the director's other works , I was annoyed by the " artsy " tone of the film and the New Wave sensibilities of it . I'll be honest and up front about this - - I hate most of the Godard films I have seen as well as SOME of Truffaut's films ( two of the " gods " of French New Wave cinema ) . Strange camera angles and the avoidance of normal movie conventions may impress some , but I felt lost . I hated the goofy poetry-like dialog that was used while scenes went back and forth between the lovers and documentary footage of the civilians of the Hiroshima post-blast . It seemed to trivialize and muddle the impact of their pain . So why did I give it a 3 and not a 1 ? Well , I have seen a lot of French films and there are some whose level of awfulness reaches far greater heights than this film ( and there are some that are absolute masterpieces ) . If you think this film is bad , try watching Alphaville or Last Night At Marienbad - - now THESE are really bad French films !
458597	2467618	350754	3.0	What a filthy and unpleasant mess	This is a film that has lovely and very inventive animation . Other than that , there was absolutely nothing I liked about the film . The 3 points it earns are only for the animation , as the rest of the film is just ugly and throughly unpleasant - - a hateful and nihilistic mess . It looks as if someone decided to make a film just to offend and make people mad or ill - - and had no other purpose . The story , such as it is , seems more an excuse to splice in images of people giving the British equivalent of the middle finger , showing lots of hard-core obscenities on the walls and maggots feasting on rotting food among other such repellent images . In many ways , this film is like The Sex Pistols of film-dom - - just meant to be loud , nasty and offensive . And , naturally , some idiots thought this was art and nominated it for a BAFTA award . By this standard , I think I could make an animation of someone defecating and probably get a nomination . What a waste .
462371	2467618	1680	3.0	Definitive proof that D . W . Griffith hated Black people !	This short film combined with his epic BIRTH OF A NATION is definitive proof that D . W . Griffith had both contempt for Black people and believed strongly in the myth that the " Old South " was paradise for the slaves ! The film begins with the Master going off to war and all the slaves crying and wishing him luck ( in real life , they probably would have cheered - - hoping he'd get his head blown off ! ) . But , as luck would have it , the man soon is pushing up the daisies ( that's DEAD to all you who don't understand American slang ) . His sword is the only thing that returns home . A bit later , the house with the sword catches fire and a devoted slave not only saves the little White girl , but returns to rescue the sword ! Then , at then end , he houses the girl and her mom in his shack ( a mansion compared to most real slave quarters ) and sleeps outside like some sort of devoted dog . Oh , and did I mention that all the Black actors were really White folks in dark makeup ? ! While I must admit that Griffith made some great films and was very , very important to the early film industry , there must be a lot of people who would love to know he's burning in Hell for his depiction of Black Americans ! ! This film is important historically and probably should be seen by teens to know just how far we have come .
464453	2467618	51881	3.0	Not that bad , but it sinks due to an overuse of stock footage AND poor special effects - - even for a 1950s sci-fi film .	The story idea behind THE LOST MISSILE isn't bad at all , but unfortunately the story does get a bit dull towards the middle and the overuse of stock footage as well as poor special effects sink this film to the sub-par level . The film begins with a missile heading towards the Earth . In a panic because it's about to strike the Earth , the Soviets manage to deflect the object . This isn't necessarily good , however , as this seemingly unmanned craft has a vapor trail that destroys everything in its path AND the ship is now in a low orbit over the planet . In other words , with each pass it makes , a swath of death follows - - one that could potentially kill us all ! ! So , it's up to the good scientists of the US ( led by a very young and hardly recognizable Robert Loggia ) to formulate and plan to save us - - and especially save New York that is in its immediate flight path ! Unfortunately , they aren't able to save Ottawa ( I've never been there , so I can't say whether or not this is a big loss ) but thanks to good old American know-how , they are able to eventually destroy this harbinger of destruction ! ! So , as you can see , the story idea isn't bad and rather original . But , so many old clips of fighter planes and guys manning radar scopes gets a bit old and it seemed like padding . Overall , a decent but hardly inspired film that extreme fans of the genre may like - - all others , see it at your own risk .
461830	2467618	142388	3.0	This showed how much Stan needed Ollie	This film was made long before Stan Laurel was teamed up with Oliver Hardy . This film was made the same year the team's first picture was made ( LUCKY DOG ) , but it was still eight years before they began deliberately putting the two in the same film . Without Oliver Hardy , Stan was a solo act for about a decade . Some of his films , such as DR . PYCKLE AND MR . PRYDE , was exceptionally funny , while many such as HUSTLING FOR HEALTH were rather tedious . The film begins with Stan about to go on vacation . However , he arrives late for the train . A stranger offers to let him come to his house because he'll be able to get all the relaxation he needs there . However , it's soon apparent that this " benefactor " is a jerk and he puts Stan to work around the noisy house . None of the jokes are particularly funny and there seems to be absolutely no reason for Stan to stay in this place . In fact , the film might best be described as tedious - - which is very sad as I love silent comedy and most of the films of Stan Laurel .
462189	2467618	122498	4.0	This film was missing something	I guess I am the dissenting vote here , but I didn't particularly like GASMAN . Some of it isn't the fault of those who made the film , but was the fault of the people who put this film on disk . That's because the accents were at times very hard for me to understand and there was no captioning on the DVD . To the average American , some British accents are tough to understand and my mild hearing loss made this a particularly frustrating film . However , what the film makers could have done better was providing a context for this short film . You gather that the man has two families but you are left asking so many questions that aren't explained in the film . In other words , it's a short film that has left out key portions of the narrative - - and this just seemed sloppy . It's too bad , because the basic idea behind the short was interesting . By the way , this film is part of the CINEMA 16 : European Shorts DVD . On this DVD are 16 shorts . Most aren't great , though because it contains THE MAN WITHOUT A HEAD , COPY SHOP , RABBIT and WASP , it's an amazing DVD for lovers of short films and well worth buying - - it's just a shame about the captioning .
462814	2467618	35617	4.0	Not bad - - just not very good either	If you watch this movie and have no idea who Laurel and Hardy were and were never a fan , then this movie is an okay time-passer . However , for people like me who love the comedy team and have seen most of their movies , it's a major disappointment . Like all the movies the made after A CHUMP AT OXFORD , the film really did not need to be made . Laurel and Hardy were now obviously old and lacked the spark of their earlier films . On top of that , these films were not made by the Hal Roach production company , so they lack the style and look that made the team great . In fact , now that I think about it , this film could have been made with Abbott and Costello or perhaps Red Skelton or some other comedians of the day and the film would have probably been better ! Seeing a morbidly obese Ollie and a super-tired looking Stan just knocks the comedic wind out of the movie's sails ! The boys are a couple of total screw-ups who want to help with the war effort . But , they are too feeble for the military and so they volunteer as Civil Defense workers . In this role , again and again they blow it until they are forced to resign . This all is more pathetic and sad than funny . However , being a formulaic movie , you know that somehow they will redeem themselves at the end - - which they do . How exactly this all occurs , you'll have to see for yourself , but I personally wouldn't bother watching this dull and listless film unless you are a maniac like me who is trying to see all of the team's films . A final note : Donald Meek , one of my favorite supporting actors of the age , plays the most unusual and against type roles imaginable . See the film and you'll know what I mean !
458687	2467618	765497	4.0	Wow . . . . was that unpleasant .	This was a well acted film but the subject is so unappealing I really have no idea who the intended audience is . This short film purports to be a video entry from a man who talks about how " the sickness followed us to the new house " and as he cries and tries to explain what happened in a very fragmented manner , you gather that he's a schizophrenic who feels a compulsion to stop the pain - - - and you see clips of a wife who is tied up with her mouth duck taped shut . The man then goes from room to room - - killing his child , his wife and finally himself . It's all very , very realistic and I see that the people who made it had some professional skills - - making the film seem very real . BUT , who would want to see what seems to be a confession of a maniac ! ? This is so thoroughly unpleasant and I didn't think the payoff was worth it . These talented people , however , should not give up - - just pick something with some appeal to more than just a very tiny audience .
462457	2467618	351382	4.0	A short film perhaps only the Japanese could love	I love Japanese movies - - having seen at least 100-200 . So it's obvious I am not afraid of Japanese films . However , sometimes there are Japanese concepts for film that just don't translate well to Westerners . They might be hits at home , but abroad they just don't seem , well , . . . normal . It's like the live fish my wife ate on a business meeting or odd PS2 games such as dating simulators or Katamari Damacy - - things that are accepted there that confuse non-Japanese . This is probably the way others view things Americans take for granted , such as American football , fried Snicker bars and Paris Hilton ! Well the king of strange Japanese films that just don't seem right to Americans might just be ATAMA-YAMA . Now the style of animation isn't the issue - - it's different but nice enough . No , it's the story concept itself and the rather bizarre ending . That's what make this a truly unusual film and it goes like this : There was a stingy man who , for no apparent reason , had a tree growing out of his head . It was little at first and he simply cut it away , but again and again it grew back - - so he just decided to let it go . And , after a while , people began living on his head under the shade of the tree . Oddly , while they were under the tree , they were tiny but when they left , they were full sized again . Then , after finally getting sick of it all and yanking out the tree , the man drown himself ( ! ? ) in the hole in the top of the head where the tree was ! The end . See ! I told you this was very , very odd - - but not in a good way like TAMPOPO or HAPPINESS OF THE KATAKURIS - - just odd . O-D-D . . . . odd ! And unless you have a very high tolerance for this sort of thing , I doubt if you'll feel bad to know that this Oscar-nominated film did not win . Frankly , that makes me happy , as I really DON'T want this film to spur on such similar films . The only reason it earns a 4 is due to nice , but not spectacular animation . This film made my brain hurt . . . . I hope that isn't a sign that I have a tree !
461300	2467618	121766	4.0	Finally - - - a Star Wars film designed just for kids and dumb people !	Well , at the outset , this film already lost a point or two from me since it , once again , features that nauseating character " Jar-Jar " . While some of my friends pointed out that he wasn't in this film as much as in the previous two , having him in the film at all makes me hate the movie . Why George Lucas dogmatically refused to admit that this character was a HUGE marketing mistake AND that he even went back to the earlier films to add him into irrelevant scenes for the DVD release is beyond me . Obviously , he is NOT a person who can admit he was wrong ! All the unpurchased Jar-Jar merchandise sitting on store shelves as well as all the " I hate Jar-Jar " web sites SHOULD be an indication that he is less than loved by the public ! Now apart from that , the film is very lovely to look at - - with great special effects and tons of eye candy for the viewer . You can't fault the action . However , I also think this film was designed for dumb people , as literate and non-cerebrally impaired people will notice that the dialog is simply one cliché after another . I know this may sound arrogant , but George Lucas wrote horrid dialog . When it comes to logic , this is also often missing from the film . I felt like screaming during at the scene where Vader is battling in a volcano - - yet he doesn't break a sweat and only is injured when he eventually falls into the molten goo . He and his nemesis would have been vaporized long before touching the stuff and also would have choked to death on noxious fumes . Apparently this volcano only releases oxygen and is only hot to the touch ! Additionally , while little kids loved it , when Yoda does his ninja-Jedi fighting scene , I was horrified at its stupidity . It was simply intended to entertain the lowest common denominator in the theater and was completely out of character . Many adults , I assume , cringed during these awful scenes . When I compare this film to the earlier films , I am left saddened . Couldn't they have found a better script or at least edited it before filming began ? Or perhaps gotten a professional script writer . What a disappointment .
461106	2467618	2045	4.0	Decent for 1912 , but not all that interesting today	This film is about a college baseball pitcher who is forced to drop out of school and move to the wild west . There he gets a job as a cashier and when he is robbed by a bandit , he knocks the crook out with a well-aimed baseball pitch - - thus saving the day AND winning the girl . There's not much more to it than that - - and like most films of the day , the plot is paper thin . Now this is not a complaint - - for 1912 , this is a decent film and at 10 minutes , it's about as long as the average film . Full-length movies as we know them were just in their infancy . Unfortunately , when seen today the film just seems silly and pointless - - and is only of interest to someone who is either a baseball freak or a film historian .
462105	2467618	50599	4.0	Cary Grant and Jayne Mansfield - - together ? !	While I recently gave OPERATION PETTICOAT a positive review , I really didn't like this film even though it had so many similarities . Both were made just a few years apart , both starred Cary Grant and both were WWII comedies . However , the overall tone and style of the films were quite different . KISS HER FOR ME , overall , just seemed like a cheaper film - - with poor writing , little energy and some VERY broad performances - - even when compared to OPERATION PETTICOAT . I think that at least much of the blame for this lies in casting Jayne Mansfield . The combination of her ample talents and limited acting ability really made this A-budget film look like it came from a 3rd rate studio . Plus , there wasn't much chemistry or energy in pairing her with Cary Grant - - an actor generally loved for his grace and class . It's sort of like pairing Sir Lawrence Olivier with Marjorie Main .
458388	2467618	2461	4.0	Not horrible for 1912 , but pretty much unwatchable today	This was a very , very early full-length film . According to the video box , it was the first full-length American-made film , but that is debatable - - as several films have made that claim and exactly what constitutes " full-length " is pretty vague . Regardless , I have to commend the cast for trying something unique and epic , though in today's light the film is a totally boring mess and only of interest to cinephiles . Instead of the modern notion of story-telling and action , the crew was breaking new ground and made a bizarre film that appears more like a series of vignettes instead of a coherent film . Instead of a moving and evolving narrative like we are used to , the film was made with a real-life traveling acting troop . But , instead of having them act out the story , the film shows inter-title cards that describe what has occurred and the cast pose like they are going to be photographed or just make a few minimal movements or actions until the next card appears to describe an all-new scene . It's almost like looking at a series of stereoscope cards that move just a little and all together tell a very , very dull story . Very static and horrid to watch , it DID try something different and this is an amazingly important film historically - - I just would NEVER want to have to watch it again !
463949	2467618	35034	5.0	Silly and predictable , but still fun	This is not one of Warner Brothers ' finest films , as the writing is pretty silly at times and terribly predictable . For example , when the character " Pop " appeared , I said to my daughter that that old guy would have to die in the film - - and about 20 minutes later , sure enough , he had assumed room temperature ! In fact , throughout the film , the action was pretty ordinary and often telegraphed . Despite starring Edward G . Robinson , Marlene Dietrich and George Raft , the film had a definite " B-movie " feel to it due to the shallow plot and rather one-dimensional characters . This one-dimensionality was especially true with Robinson , as he was amazingly pugnacious and impossible to believe throughout . Now despite all this and the overall ordinary nature of the film , it still is rather entertaining and worth a look if there is nothing better on television . Not a great film but a decent time-passer . By the way , a few years earlier , Warner Brothers made a somewhat similar film called SLIM . While MANPOWER is not exactly a re-make , they both have a lot of similarities and involve death and danger on the power lines .
463132	2467618	156578	5.0	It's amazing how short this film was and how quickly it all ends	As I said above , it's amazing how short this Patsy Kelly film is . While it was intended as a short , at only nine minutes , the movie doesn't last nearly as long as other similar films - - that usually range from 12 to 20 minutes . While generally this would be a serious problem , for me it was a blessing ! I have only seen a few Patsy Kelly films but have hated her so much for her lousy over-acting that I was thrilled this movie didn't last so long . It's hard to describe her , but she looked and sounded a lot like an obnoxious version of Rosie O'Donnell . Physically they looked pretty similar , but Kelly nearly always spoke louder than a Concord in flight ! ! Screaming your lines in a Brooklyn accent just isn't comedy - - - it's the recipe for a migraine . But as I said , the film is blessedly short and Patsy actually under-acts compared to her usual assault on your senses ! The film is about a rich dame ( Kelly ) who is trying to buy some class but has no idea what class and sophistication really are . So , some con artists try to take advantage of the situation . The movie is imminently forgettable but at least it is watchable and not bad . This is a definite time-passer or a film for someone wanting to see what Kelly looked like in a more cerebral role ( sort of like for those who wanted to see Curly Howard doing Shakespeare ) .
460032	2467618	34841	5.0	It's really hard to rate this one . . .	While almost all the animators in North America seemed to be working for the war effort making propaganda and educational films to help , somehow Norman McLaren found time to make this film that has absolutely nothing to do with WWII or even entertainment , per se . Instead , this is an experimental little film about a chicken - - a chicken this dances and moves in time to the song " Turkey in the Straw " . The drawings are simple but effective and I can respect the effort that went into it . But it wasn't meant an anything other than an experiment - - and the film even says this at the beginning . Oh , and speaking of the beginning , I found that odd . The words " The National Film Board " ( who sponsored the film ) appear in about a half dozen languages - - including German and Italian . Considering Canada was at war with these countries , it is a bit surprising they were included and non-combatant languages ( such as Spanish or Portuguese ) were not used . This is NOT a criticism - - just an observation . As far as rating it goes , I'll give it a 5 . I can respect the experiment but there really isn't much about this that you must see .
461578	2467618	35774	5.0	Not one of Daffy's better moments	Historically speaking , this is a pretty important film , as it helped solidify the public in the war effort against the Nazis . However , from a purely aesthetic point of view , it's not one of the better made or entertaining Daffy Duck films ever made . Daffy appears behind German lines and spends most of the film annoying a Nazi officer and his flunky , Schultz . Again and again , Daffy outwits them until the end , when he is shot by a howitzer and he lands in the middle of one of Hitler's speeches . Oddly , while it was a cartoon , Hitler looked very realistic . The film ends with Daffy bashing Hitler over the head with a mallet . On Google videos , this cartoon short appears under the heading " banned cartoons " and whether or not Warner Brothers actually banned or at least pulled it from circulation in unknown , though considering most of the public have no interest in WWII propaganda cartoons , I wouldn't be surprised if they did .
459925	2467618	764640	5.0	An interesting art style isn't enough to make this one worth seeking	This is one of the animated shorts from THE ANIMATION SHOW : VOLUME 2 . Most of the shorts in this DVD collection are rather poor because very few are funny and the emphasis is much more or art than entertainment in this second installment . For better films overall , see VOLUME 1 . This film is actually one of the better ones from the collection , but it still didn't do much for me . The story is about some ladies whose job it is to travel to grocery stores giving out free samples . In addition to describing their job , they talk about what they dislike about it as well . Considering that their job only entails this sort of repetitive work , the narration and plot was incredibly dull . Fortunately , the animation style , while not particularly good ( it was VERY hard on the eyes ) , it was at least different - - unusual enough to merit it being seen if you are an animation junkie . However , as I said , it is hard on the eyes , as none of the animated characters or backgrounds stay still - - they all bob up and down independently of each other and are enough to make you seasick ! !
460307	2467618	36446	5.0	You CAN'T ban everything just because someone might become offended	This cartoon was shelved a long time ago by Warner Brothers because the cartoon is indeed awfully racist and shows the Japanese to be incredibly stupid and practically sub-human . HOWEVER , as a history teacher , I really wish this toon were more available because it was an important product of the times . Many nations around the world were at war with Japan and this movie was a form of propaganda meant to inspire the folks at home . Political Correctness was NOT a consideration , as the war was a war of survival for many - - the fact that it surely would offend the Japanese certainly wasn't a concern ! So , today , many would like to take these inflammatory cartoons and bury them - - but this is a big mistake , as history ( with all its blemishes ) is not something that you can " cut and paste " to satisfy sensibilities - - if this WERE the case , we might as well just burn offensive books and never teach history . My feeling is that cartoons like these are wonderful when shown and explained in their context . As a teaching tool , they are great and help us to understand the era and the mood of the people at home . This cartoon , the best I can tell , is not available on DVD or video anywhere . I was only able to see it on youtube . com when I typed in " banned cartoons " and after registering and then seeing a warning that indicated it was a racially offensive cartoon . Gee , . . . it's easier to view porn online than this cartoon ! ! The overall quality of the art is just fine but it's in black and white . The jokes , though , are awfully lame AND offensive but the cartoon WAS a very effective tool . See it and learn .
464048	2467618	32781	5.0	Great for aviation buffs , but for the rest it's pretty much a dud	The film has two main themes . A world-famous aviator ( Dix ) has slowly destroyed his once amazing career and he has his pilot's license revoked for being drunk in the cockpit . The film is about his rebuilding his life , though through very long stretches of the film he is absent or practically absent as the second plot took precedence during most of the film . A small aircraft manufacturer is trying to design a fighter plane in order to win a lucrative government contract . So much of the film concerns the struggles they go through as well as a budding relationship that never seems to get off the ground between the project manager and a female draftsman . As far as the plane goes , I know most who see the film won't notice some of the problems with how they executed the flying sequences and the plane itself . While the plane is supposed to be " the latest thing " and capable of flying over 400 m . p . h . , the design is actually similar to experimental craft being produced from 1932-1936 ( looking a lot like the airplane used in the old Universal Studios intros ) , so in so many ways the craft was totally obsolete . This isn't a real issue for the average person , but hey , for us aviation buffs it is noticeable . But what IS noticeable even for the casual viewer are the silly physics of the plane as it flies . It's very obviously a model and it executes turns that no plane EVER could make - - making the tiniest loop-to-loops and spins in history ! A little more money and effort could have made for much more realistic and less silly flying sequences . However , even despite these problems , the movie is about a seldom discussed topic and I found it very interesting from a historical standpoint . As for me , personally , I would score this movie a 6 or 7 , since I am a huge fan of the history of aviation and am a school teacher . However , I also understand that for the average viewer , this film will no doubt be pretty dull stuff and provide little entertainment . Also , as far as a the romance goes , it never really made much sense and never seemed to get past minor infatuation . Plus , for fans of Richard Dix ( and there must be a few out there ) , his role in the film is pretty small and not especially heroic - - despite him receiving top billing .
462507	2467618	19777	5.0	way too stagy and difficult to watch	The main culprit for this being a poor Marx Brothers film is time . While the brothers are quite funny at times , the film itself really suffers from lousy sound due to its being made at the very beginning of the sound era . This was true of MANY films from 1927-1929 , so it is in no way a slam against the Marxes that this occurs . Secondly , unlike all their later films , this was filmed inside an old film studio on the East Coast and it REALLY REALLY looks like a stage production . In particular , the backgrounds are obvious paintings . So who would enjoy this film ? Well , film buffs will be thrilled to see it because it's the earliest available footage of the Marxes ( though they supposedly made a film appearance before this and it was lost ) . Also , fans of the Marxes will find enough to entertain them to make it worth watching . Most others , though , will not be particularly impressed and should try other Marx Brothers films FIRST so as not to be scared away by the cheapness of this film .
461007	2467618	89853	5.0	excellent until a completely unsatisfying ending	This movie really got me hooked . The plot about an unhappy women who goes to see the same escapist film again and again is charming - - particularly when the characters in the movie begin to notice that she keeps coming back again and again ! Ultimately , the hero of the movie is so taken by her devotion , that he literally walks out of the picture to meet her and then refuses to go back ! This is WONDERFUL and surreal . It got even better when all the other characters just stood by and waited and waited for him to return and finally didn't know what to do with themselves ! ! This was great . Then , for some odd reason ( not that it wasn't already odd ) , the movie could NEVER end until he returned and they couldn't show any movies until this was resolved . I was THRILLED and up until the end , this may have been my favorite Woody Allen movie . Unfortunately , the same sweetness that had prevailed throughout most of the movie completely disappeared at the end . Instead of the expected ending , it provided a " life stinks " ending and completely ruined the experience for me . In fact , I think the movie ended on a rather cruel note .
458812	2467618	52530	6.0	Great film - - rotten soundtrack	4-D man starts off very poorly , as the opening music sound like it was written for a 1950s strip club . Unfortunately , while it did get a bit better , it still was brash , loud and cheap and often seemed like music designed for a beatnik coffee house - - not a sci-fi film . Additionally , the film features a romance that just isn't believable - - happening almost instantly and making very little sense . This was less annoying than the music - - more of a minor problem . However , despite having these two strikes against it , the film manages to still be a dandy sci-fi film - - partly because it was NOT about some bug-eyed monsters or aliens . The film begins with a young researcher ( James Congdon ) getting fired . He hitchhikes to the lab where his brother ( Robert Lansing ) is in charge of a team working on a new impervious metal . However , the younger brother says that he's been working on a matter amplifier that will allow ANYTHING to be permeated . Later , when Lansing is playing with Congdon's machinery , he manages to pass his hand through a block of metal - - in a rather terrifying scene . Oddly , soon after this , Lansing finds he's able to continue passing through objects even without using the electronic equipment - - just his own will ! Naturally , being a 50s sci-fi film , this power turns out to be far greater and difficult to control than they'd imagine - - leading to deadly consequences ! The plot is interesting ( and rather reminiscent of THE INVISIBLE MAN ) , the special effects pretty good for 1959 and the story was unique . I liked it a lot - - too bad it was given such annoying and funky music - - it deserved MUCH better .
460357	2467618	35105	6.0	A decent film , but often it seemed to try a bit too hard .	The film begins in Columbus , Ohio and young Eileen has visions of stardom on the stage - - though she only has worked in community theater . Her older sister , Rosalind Russell , is an aspiring writer and they agree to both go to New York to seek fame and fortune . Along the way , they meet a bazillion crazy characters who wander into their basement apartment faster than is humanly possible . And , yes , I truly do mean wander into the apartment . It's like Grand Central Station in there and after a while the gimmick just doesn't make sense . Subtle it ain't ! MY SISTER EILEEN is a screwball comedy that is very , very aware that that is exactly what it should be . While often cute and enjoyable , all too often the film seems to think that by being too loud , too chaotic and too goofy , it will be a successful film . Personally , I enjoyed it but wish they'd perhaps slowed the whole thing down and tried for at least some subtlety and style . It made the pacing of ARSENIC AND OLD LACE and BRINGING UP BABY seem absolutely slow by comparison ! ! Throughout this film , whenever the action seems to slow , the film makers seem to just randomly toss characters into the mix with the instructions " act kooky " - - sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't . As a result , it's a very hit or miss production . However , fortunately , the film ends on a very high note with a surprise ( and funny ) cameo appearance . I won't say more - - it might spoil the fun . Overall , it's a good time-passer and a decent film , but don't expect magic .
461064	2467618	313189	6.0	A decent Snub Pollard effort	In this film , Snub leaves his extremely tiny town to go live with his aunt , who he doesn't even know . He arrives at her house when she's throwing a party and she doesn't want to invite him inside . . . until she learns he owns an oil well . Then she encourages him to meet and become smitten with her daughter . However , Snub isn't that interested in this vamp and instead is interested in the maid . But due to their persistence , Snub finally agrees to marry the cousin - - at which point the maid hatches a plan to expose the ruse and a silent comedy chase ensues . This isn't a great comedy by any stretch of the imagination , but it does have a decent number of laughs as well as a few that fall very flat ( such as those involving the duck ) . While far from Pollard's best ( IT'S A GIFT ) , it still is watchable and cute . And , unfortunately , it's made worse by the ill-fitting music that was just slapped onto this short in the " Old Time Comedy Classics : Volume 9 " DVD . Like almost all their films , the appropriateness of the music seemed irrelevant to those who assembled this collection .
462950	2467618	452497	6.0	Funny but far from sophisticated !	This film is a decent silent comedy though it isn't much better than average . It stars the surprisingly young Jack Duffy - - who is only about 44 in the film though he appears about 70 . Apparently Duffy was quite the makeup artist and following his career decline , he made a place for himself in Hollywood as a makeup man . The film begins during a meeting of an organization dedicated to the elimination of boxing . However , in a not particularly inspired moment , Duffy and another man get in an argument and agree to settle it by having a box-off - - where both bring a boxer to decide the argument . This really makes no sense considering the club and the transition was rather poor . However , the fight itself was reasonably funny - - especially when Duffy entered the ring and caused a riot - - followed by a lengthy and well made police chase . Is this great or sophisticated humor ? Hardly ! However , it will make you laugh now and then and it's a chance to see Duffy star in a film - - there are lots of films in which he was a supporting player .
461025	2467618	70833	6.0	Not really a blaxploitation film	While this movie is set mostly in the Black neighborhoods of Philadelphia , many of the Whites are quite prejudiced and many of the actors are Black , this really isn't a blaxploitation film - - though Netflix has categorized it that way on its web site . Instead , it's like a more modern version of THE STING with a multiracial cast . Mel Stewart ( " Henry Jefferson " from ALL IN THE FAMILY ) and Kiel Martin star as con-men who swindle the wrong man . The old guy they cheat out of $10 , 000 suffers a fatal heart attack when he realizes he was swindled AND he's the uncle of a mob boss - - who now has ordered the deaths of these cons . However , unlike THE STING , there is some rough language , nudity and a very , very downbeat ending . I enjoyed the film and appreciated seeing these two lesser name actors getting a chance to play leads , but hate seeing it branded with the label " blaxploitation " because many take this to mean that the film is cheap and formulaic - - which it certainly isn't . Hardly a great film , it is still well worth a look for an interesting story .
459200	2467618	50629	6.0	despite bad miscasting , not a bad flick	Once you ignore the fact that there is almost no chemistry between the leads , John Wayne and Sophia Loren , you will probably enjoy this Indiana Jone-like movie . It's seldom shown on American TV , so you may have a hard time finding it . Perhaps this is because these stars have certainly made better films . I honestly think part of the problem with the chemistry is that the love between the two characters only reveals itself towards the end but most of the problem is that in hindsight you wonder WHO thought these two looked good together ? It just didn't seem natural . Most of this , I think , was due to Wayne's being miscast as an adventurer in the African desert . You just don't expect to see Wayne there . Now if it had been the Mojave Desert in the good old USA , then it would have seemed more plausible .
459664	2467618	33174	6.0	See the OTHER version of this same story line !	1940 was a wonderful year for " lost spouse returning " films . Both this film as well as MY FAVORITE WIFE debuted a short time apart and they are , on the surface , very , very similar movies . In MY FAVORITE WIFE , Irene Dunne is lost at sea and assumed dead . Years later , she's declared legally dead and Cary Grant ( her husband ) remarries . Dunne then returns just after the wedding and hilarity ensues . In TOO MANY HUSBANDS , Fred MacMurray is lost at sea and assumed dead . He's declared dead almost right away and Jean Arthur ( his wife ) remarried . Fred then returns to find she now has two husbands and only a little bit of hilarity ensued ! In fact , because these two films were so similar , lawsuits were launched . I really don't know how they were settled or which movie came first . All I know is that MY FAVORITE WIFE is definitely the better of the two . The fact that TOO MANY HUSBANDS was only showed on TCM for the first time a week ago is probably indication that it is the lesser films - - especially since MY FAVORITE WIFE is a commonly seen film on American cable TV . The problem is the writing . While the cast of TOO MANY HUSBANDS is just fine ( Jean Arthur , Fred MacMurray and Melvin Douglas ) , the lines they are given and the situations they are placed in just aren't as funny . In particular , Jean's character is VERY annoying at times - - as she seems like a selfish and immature person throughout the film . This is BAD , as Jean's usual screen persona is of a sweet and spunky lady - - here she in an indecisive and whiny person . Just think - - in this film , she learns she has two husbands and LIKES IT when the two guys are ready to fight it out as well as all the attention they pay her ! ! Conversely , the fact that Cary and Irene in the other film truly love each other never really is in question - - the problem is just figuring out HOW to extricate themselves from the mess ! While this is still a pretty good film ( nearly meriting a 7 ) , it just isn't in the same league as the other one . If you love old films like I do , see them both . If you only want to pick one , then the answer is pretty obvious .
458649	2467618	19729	6.0	It's a bit dusty with age , but for old movie buffs it's a must	This movie hasn't aged very well , but when it debuted it was a heck of a film - - sparking many sequels as well as an entirely new genre of films , such as 42ND STREET , FOOTLIGHT PARADE and DANCING LADY . Because of this , even in spite of its many shortcomings , it's an important film historically speaking . The film may at times look like a bunch of clichés , but you should remember that although many of the plot elements would become clichéd over time , here they were quite original . It was also the first all singing / all talking musical ( winning the Oscar for Best Picture ) , so it deserves to be remembered . Hank and Queenie are sisters who have come to Broadway to make it big . Hank knows they will become stars as a team and doesn't seem willing to consider any other option . Frankly , as I watched their act , I couldn't help but think that these two women had practically no chemistry as a team - - they couldn't sing or dance all that well together . Well , despite Hank's confidence , Mr . Zanfield ( a takeoff on Flo Ziegfeld ) wasn't interested in the team - - just Queenie . Queenie was not only much prettier but she also wasn't a giant pain in the neck and would take direction ! Hank was too self-confident as well as pushy and obnoxious . Her only experience had been dancing in small venues but she tried to lecture the great Zanfield on how to put on a show ! Despite Hank's general unlikability ( to some she had " pluck and determination " , to me she needed a rap in the mouth ) , she was still given a small part thanks to Queenie and Eddie's intervention . Hank , by the way , was the show's star and Hank's fiancé - - that does sound a bit weird , huh ? The problem is that after a while , Eddie starts to realize that Hank's little sister , Queenie , is prettier and a nicer person . It's obvious that he is falling in love with her and vice-versa . However , both Eddie and Queenie love Hank and can't hurt her , so Queenie begins dating Jock - - a rich guy . Now up until the very end , we really DON'T know Jock is no-good , but the instant Queenie shows interest in Jock , Hank interferes and tries to split them up . This isn't a good idea , as Queenie is only dating Jock in order to get Eddie out of her system . However , the longer the film goes , the more Hank rides Queenie for dating Jock . Eventually , Queenie can't take Hank's bullying any more and runs off to the arms of Jock . Fortunately , at that moment Hank figures out the score and tells Eddie their engagement is over and encourages him to marry Queenie . Eddie confronts Jock and gets punched in the kisser . Queenie runs to him and pledges her undying love , as he was willing to stand up and fight to protect her honor . Now at this point , you assume the film is over but it goes on needlessly for about 15 more minutes . The film had a lot of energy and was unique - - a truly innovative film . There were a few cute supporting characters I liked , such as the extremely flamboyant costumer as well as the three " yes-men " . They added some nice color to the film . Oh , and speaking of color , while the color has vanished over time ( a common problem with Two-Color Technicolor ) , many of the big production numbers were shot in a primitive form of color . Also , the title song ( " Broadway Melody " ) was pretty good , but they sang it about six times during the film and four times in a row ! I chalk this up not to lousy production values but to the fact this was the first musical extravaganza . Another minor problem that for me was not really a problem was the extensive use of inter-title cards . Considering this was such an early talkie , it's not surprising that they relied a bit too much on these cards to connect scenes . Let's address rest of the people in the film . The character " Uncle Jed " was annoying and insensitive . His schtick was stuttering like Porky Pig and this got old very quickly . Also , if you haven't guessed from my above comments , Hank was just too darn unlikable and you wanted Eddie to dump her . Had she been softened up a bit ( less pushy , controlling and rude ) , then the audience would have cared more for her plight . Also , when she and Queenie have their showdown , it's one of the shrillest scenes in movie history and should have been toned down a bit . Now there are also many technical problems with the film . Many of the edits are very sloppy - - either being edited too soon or allowing pointless footage to remain that should have been shortened . Frankly , it's editing is just awful - - especially in one very long and protracted scene where Queenie just stares off in space towards the end . Also , while " Melody of Broadway " is pretty good , the rest of the songs aren't . In fact , during one song that was being sung by a guy dressed as a Roman soldier , the sound and singing was so bad I couldn't understand any of the song . This wasn't just me , either , as the film featured excellent Closed Captioning when shown on Turner Classic Movies but when it came to this song , the captioning stopped - - obviously they couldn't figure it out as well ! Also , while for 1929 the dance numbers were big and impressive , but about 1932 or 1933 , these numbers looked amazingly small , poorly choreographed and flat - - needing a strong injection of the Busby Berkely touch . An important but flawed film .
464551	2467618	33596	6.0	Worth a look	Don Ameche plays a very cerebral professor who avoids dealing with his wife ( Rosalind Russell ) by over-intellectualizing their relationship . While she does love him , his refusal to act like a human being irritates her to no end - - especially when he never shows an ounce of jealousy , no matter what she does . Even when Rosalind spends time with her husband's publisher , the lecherous Van Heflin , Ameche refuses to act jealous and he takes his marriage for granted . At first , I found Russell's demands for jealousy to be petty , but after a while I wondered how any woman could live with the cold and annoying Ameche . Only later in the film when Ameche loosened up and showed his wife that he cared was everyone able to live happily ever after . This is a little comedy from MGM that tries very hard to entertain and generally does , though at times the humor does seem a tad forced . However , despite this and the shallowness of the script , the actors are fun to watch and the film has a certain kooky charm that make it a nice , though not especially deep , time-passer . Worth a look , but that's really about all .
463807	2467618	810380	7.0	Very well done , but also very strange	This is a strange little absurdist short film that can be found on the website for PBS . The reason I describe it as " absurdist " is because the reactions by the man in the dry cleaning store as well as his bizarre customers makes no sense - - they don't behave at all like sane people would . This makes the film rather funny and clever but I could also see it turning off some viewers . The film begins with a couple entering the dry cleaning store . They are covered in blood and ask the guy behind the counter if he can get them clean now . Without blinking an eye , he never asks a question but helps out - - and you next see the couple wearing towels and conversing with the guy as if nothing had happened - - no blood or bloody cleaver ! ! They talk about life , the weather , etc . and pass the time as if nothing was unusual about their request or the fact they appear to have killed someone ! I liked the film because unlike a full-length absurdist film , this style fits a shorter format better - - it doesn't get too old too quickly . I also thought the acting was exceptional considering how weird the situation was . Good stuff - - I hope to see more from these folks .
459131	2467618	17449	7.0	Pretty good , but way too familiar territory for Greta Garbo fans	This is a very good silent film , though I had just watched two other Greta Garbo films that were incredibly similar to this one - - as she plays the vamp in all three ! I can't blame Ms . Garbo for this , as MGM definitely type-cast her despite her objections . In fact , she was so irritated by this theme that she went on strike to try to force the studio to give her different roles . But , considering that the public loved the films and they were all very successful , MGM wasn't about to mess with a tried-and-true formula . This film is at least a little different in that much of the time men were destroyed when they fell for Garbo in this film , but she was never directly responsible for their downfall . She was more like the old " Typhoid Mary " character - - someone who just seems to have bad things follow her where ever she goes ! The problem with this is that no matter how sultry and alluring Ms . Garbo might have been , no one is THAT seductive that man after man after man destroy themselves in order to try to get her ! However , the story does have a few new elements and the overall production values are exceptional . So , if you view this film WITHOUT considering how derivative it is , then it's an awfully good film . By the way , the TCM DVD includes an alternative ending that was apparently used when the film was shown in rural settings . Instead of the marvelous original but sad ending ( that , in my opinion is perfect ) , there is an upbeat and sappy one that just doesn't ring true .
461659	2467618	34936	7.0	The film has some problems , BUT with Hepburn and Tracy , it's bound to still be enjoyable	This is one of the less famous films starring Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn and after having seen it again recently , I can see why . While their performances are excellent ( particularly Tracy's ) , the movie itself is a bit hard to believe and comes on a bit too strong . I'm sure this is a result of the time in which it was made , as the film had a very strong injection of patriotism and Americanism thanks to our being brought into WWII . In many ways , the film was like a variation on MR . SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON , except that Smith dies and in the end you find out he's a Fascist ! ! The film begins with the death of a famous American patriot and all around great guy . However , despite a tremendous outpouring of sympathy , his widow refuses to see or talk to anyone . . . that is , until reporter Spencer Tracy appears . Then , slowly the story of this great man begins to unfold , though over time Tracy can sense that it's all a put on - - there IS some secret that they are trying to hide from him . In the end , the secret is revealed and Hepburn inexplicably dies - - and I really didn't understand why she so quickly died and Tracy seemed just fine even though he was in the same burning building ! The film does have a few plot holes ( like the one mentioned above ) and at time it lays it on a bit thick , but still , based on the charisma of the stars , it's still well worth seeing . Just don't expect magic .
459675	2467618	488	7.0	Pretty good stuff for 1912	This is a pretty good film for 1912 and at 14 minutes , this is about average length for a movie during this era . The film is a bit overly melodramatic , but its still an interesting story . A young boy in rags is about to go on an outing for underprivileged kids . You see his tough and heart-breaking life and then you see him sneak off to the train that takes them out to the country for the picnic . All this is very well done . However , once at the picnic , things get a bit " schmaltzy " as well as VERY confusing . One of the women is reading the boy and a few other kids some story about magical fairies . Then , a bit later , the kid decides he , too , wants to go off to fairyland and hops aboard a small boat and drifts away and then the movie ends ? ! What did all this mean ? Did the kid die and this was some sort of symbolic tale or did he just go crazy and go off in the boat to die or did he REALLY make it to fairyland ? All this and much more is possible and it's really disappointing how vaguely the film concluded . Up until then , it had been pretty good stuff .
459188	2467618	35763	7.0	Very enjoyable and well made WWII war film	This was a very enjoyable WWII film , though before I discuss why I liked the movie , I should point out that the film does have one BIG cliché . When Tyrone Power meets a woman ( Anne Baxter - - here with dark brown hair ) and they immediately hate each other , lovers of classic Hollywood films know that this can only mean one thing - - - they are destined to fall in love by the end of the film ! ! Aside from this predictable aspect of the film , I really did like the movie . The first thing I noticed about the film was the gorgeous color film . For 1943 , it was terrific - - with the most vibrant blues I've ever seen - - much like the look of the great film , THE CAINE MUTINY . Twentieth-Century Fox really pulled out the stops to make this film look nice . As far as the plot goes , it's a pretty exciting and standard submarine film . Now that I write this , I realize that they sure made a lot of great sub films over the years - - with hardly a stinker among them . This film maintains the excellent tradition of such lovely films as RUN SILENT RUN DEEP , THE ENEMY BELOW and DESINTATION TOKYO - - all lovely films that are both gripping and entertaining . The film has more plot than just subs and Anne Baxter . It seems that Tyrone Power was very happy and successful aboard PT boats . When he was transferred to sub duty , he wasn't particularly excited , as he thought that patrol boats were the greatest thing since sliced bread . However , over time , he makes good and grows to love the submarine . CRASH DIVE has some excellent action scenes - - particularly the attack on a secret base near the end . The acting good , script very good for a wartime propaganda flick and I particularly liked the sympathetic portrayal of the Black sailor - - something pretty rare in a film of the era . Overall , a good and enjoyable film .
461001	2467618	190552	7.0	Very good , but not great drama of love and obsession	This is an extremely beautiful movie that was filmed in the stark landscape of the Canary Islands . The film begins with a rather restrained and dull young man coming from Spain to be the island's doctor . One of his servants is the young Mararía and the doctor does not appear to show any great interest in her . Later , an English vulcanologist arrives and is instantly smitten with the girl . They soon begin screwing like sex-crazed weasels and she plans on their upcoming marriage . But , the Englishman is a jerk and has no intention of marrying her - - even when she becomes pregnant . When the doctor hears this , he murders the Englishman and stuffs him and his belongings into one of the volcanic vents . But despite her being jilted , the woman insists the Englishman will return one day . Soon afterwards , the doctor is drafted and does not return for almost six years . When he does , he is obsessed with the woman and even tries to force himself on her . She refuses to marry him ( who would after being pawed like that ? ) . Later , he tells her he murdered the Englishman and she should stop waiting and marry him . She naturally reacts to this and he tries to rape her . She then tosses herself into a fire and the movie ends . While much of the plot is quite interesting , it switches from intelligently written and compelling to stupid and inexplicable - - thus reducing the film's impact . Having the doctor kill the Englishman was not a bad idea , but then to be SO obsessed and attacking the girl repeatedly made no sense - - especially after he had previously shown little interest in her . Plus , her tossing herself into the fire , while cool to watch , made little sense . It's a shame because with a few tweaks , it could have been a much better film . Still , despite its flaws , it's worth seeing .
464535	2467618	18218	7.0	The film sure looks great .	One thing you sure have to say about OLD SAN FRANCISCO is that it is a very lovely film to see . The print , though very old , is in almost pristine shape ( at least the version they showed on Turner Classic Movies ) and the soundtrack exceptional . In addition , the director and cinematographer were absolutely brilliant - - making the most of every scene with the most artistic touch for a silent I have seen in a very long time . Delores Costello is simply luminous thanks to them and so many of the scenes were treats for the eyes - - such as the scene between Costello and her suitor at the fountain . It just doesn't get much prettier than this . As for the story , it was nice to see that Hollywood was trying to be sensitive towards Hispanic-Americans , as they are shown in a very sympathetic light . A major problem is that despite being so very pro-minority , none of the people playing these roles are Hispanic - - a very common problem in Hollywood until the 1960s ( and sometimes beyond ) . Today such a practice would be condemned - - in 1927 , it was par for the course . In this film , Delores Costello did a great job acting ( she was terrific ) , but she looked about as Hispanic as Shirley Temple . If you don't believe me that such casting was common , try watching a Charlie Chan or Mr . Moto film - - - as these characters were repeatedly played by actors of European descent . In fact , Warner Oland who popularized the Chan role is even in this film playing the role of a big dumb jerk who happens to be a Mongolian man posing as a White man ! Oh , and most of the Asians in this film are drug dealers , pimps or assorted low-lifes , so I am pretty sure Asian-Americans probably didn't line up to see this film ! The story is about a family of noble Spanish blood living in San Francisco in the early 20th century . Though they have lived there before the Americans arrived , they are continually treated like outsiders as the Anglos and Chinese gangs take advantage of them again and again . Thanks to a nice young Irishman who has fallen for sweet Delores , the family has a benefactor and things might work out for the better . . . . or not ! See it for yourself to see if sweet Delores manages to escape the lecherous clutches of the Chinese underworld white slavers and greedy land speculators ( for a hint : God doesn't like what is happening and perhaps He'll have to intervene ) . Despite the film's many shortcomings and overt racism as well as a sappy ending ( all of which can be understood based on the age of the film and prevailing social mores ) , the film certainly IS exciting - - mostly because of its scandalous subject matter and fast pace . This combined with the artistic nature of the film make it a film worth seeing . Just don't let your politically correct friends and co-workers know ! The sight of Oland's midget brother kept locked in a cage throughout the film like a dog is just too much to bear .
464455	2467618	35428	7.0	While far from perfect , a very enjoyable Joan Crawford flick	This is certainly not one of the more famous films made by Joan Crawford in her long career , but I wish it was because in many ways she parodies the hard as nails image she strongly cultivated in films . The movie begins with the fascist-like Crawford at a board meeting for a corporation she heads . You can tell right away that she is the stereotypical hard working , sex loathing , female image common in some 1940s films . In fact , in many ways , she seems like a 1940s version of Scrooge - - though perhaps a bit less likable ! ! Into this rigid and career-driven world arrives Melvin Douglas - - a writer who is doing a book on the way this corporation mistreats the employees . Crawford is angered by this , but considering it's all true and her actions fuel the fire , there isn't much she can do . Douglas also enjoys baiting and irritating Crawford - - once again , because she makes this so much fun ! In many ways , this film is reminiscent of the wonderful DEVIL AND MISS JONES , as later , Crawford attends an employee function and is accepted with open arms - - because they have no idea she's their hated boss ! And , like this other film , it's a good comedy with plenty to make audiences happy . The only serious deficit is that the ending is drawn out way too long and could have benefited from a trimming . All the actors were just fine , though I was particularly impressed by Bilie Burke's supporting role . Unlike most of her films , she was much more restrained and less annoying than usual - - this time , she was a very welcome addition . By the way , a few final observations . First , when the doctor was describing the symptoms of falling in love , he actually described symptoms of schizophrenia ! Also , there is a mistake in that the alarm that CONSTANTLY goes off at night on the trucks only occurs at the beginning of the film . Later , at the same time of night , the alarm is strangely silent .
460019	2467618	886696	7.0	A rather melancholy portrait but one worth seeing	This is the story of a long-time New Orleans resident , Louis Harding , and his recollections of the Black community long before Hurricane Katrina as well as his feelings about the state of the community today . He actually feels that they were much better off in the early 20th century during the years of the UNIA ( an organization created by civil rights leader , Marcus Garvey ) , as Black ownership of businesses and pride was much stronger long ago . Now , the sense of pride is diminished but Harding refuses to give up and has been working to help his community . Even after Katrina destroyed much of the city , including his properties he's worked a lifetime to own , he is determined to see the city rise again . I enjoyed this little portrait , but I would have loved more background information about New Orleans in the 1920s . I am very familiar with the UNIA and Garveyism , but nowadays , the importance of this organization and its push for Black entrepreneurs to create inner city businesses has been forgotten . Showing this connection along with Harding's insights would have made for a much more interesting film , though it is still well worth seeing .
459062	2467618	87003	7.0	a slight film with some charm	While this isn't among Woody Allen's best , I was thrilled when I saw it because , in some ways , it was a welcome departure from his overly self-analytical and self-indulgent films . In other words , the film was made simply to entertain and I liked that . While not as crazy and goofy as his earliest films , it's a cute little film where he plays a nice but hopeless talent agent that represents the weirdest and worst talent imaginable ! Well , he somehow gets mixed up with the mob and most of the movie is spent watching him nearly getting killed again and again . Mia Farrow plays a very unusual role as the gangster gal - - quite a departure from her usual roles . It's worth seeing but not especially memorable .
462682	2467618	1378	7.0	Poor by today's standards , but for the time period it's pretty good	I have seen quite a few very early Shakespeare films - - probably because I am some sort of masochist ! ! Just think about it - - there were many silent versions of Shakepeare's plays made around the turn of the 19th century that lasted from three to twenty minutes long - - not nearly enough time to do any of his plays any justice at all . It's like trying to condense the Encyclopedia Brittanica into a bumper sticker ! ! And given the low production values of the average picture of the time and generally poor acting , the films aren't especially watchable today like those of early film geniuses like Georges Méliès . However , for a bad early version of Shakepeare , this is among the best because at least a novice will have a general idea of what the play was about when the movie concludes and it's nice to see a hand painted color film - - I have got to admire all the hard work that went into making it .
459154	2467618	36027	7.0	Very good and moody reworking of Jane Eyre	This is a very strange movie in several ways - - beyond just that fact that the producer and director wanted a " strange " film . The genre of film is very tough to determine for I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE . Despite the title and the zombies , this really isn't a horror film - - though there are definitely some scary elements . And , unlike the original , it isn't exactly a romance . Sure , the nurse ( Francis Dee ) does become infatuated with the older brother ( Tom Conway - - the real life brother of George Sanders ) , but unlike the original Jane Eyre , this is not really fully developed in the film . And , in some ways , it's a mystery film because HOW Conway's wife became a zombie was a secret that is only revealed at the end . And , it's a tragedy as the ending , in particular , is quite sad . So , in effect , it's a horror-like romantic-suspense-mystery ! Considering that the movie was a B-movie with a small budget and lesser name actors , they certainly had a very successful film that delivered a lot of " bang for the buck " . The acting was decent , the direction superb and the sets super-effective . While not a great film , it is quite entertaining and worth seeing . I was really torn on how to score this film - - it's more of a 7 . 5 !
462420	2467618	174398	7.0	a nifty and LONG bio-pic	This was originally a made for TV miniseries in France . And , while it was exceptionally well-acted and pretty faithful to the life of Balzac , it was way too long and I agree with the reviewer Missy C who said that it was hard to really like the characters - - as Balzac was really screwed up and the women in his life were enablers . It was true that Balzac spent money WAY out of proportion to his income but had rich mistresses or his family to bail him out time and again . Actually , while this aspect of the film was pretty tedious on one level , psychologically speaking it is quite interesting . That's because his nasty and cold mother and he had a real love / hate relationship - - she bailed him out again and again but there seemed to be little , if any , affection between them . THEN , in a symbolic way ( at least as seen by Freudian therapists ) , Balzac tried to replicate this horrid relationship with his lovers - - all who were older women and seemed reminiscent of his mother . So , on one hand he hated his mother and on another , at least psychologically , he wanted her sexually . A very interesting aspect to the film , indeed , though something mostly of interest to psychology students and therapists . Now , as far as the film being too long , the most obvious example is the last hour of the movie . It focuses on the last three to six months or so of his life - - when he was very sickly and on the verge of death . This easily could have been summed up in 5-10 minutes but instead went on and on and on . However , at the same time WHAT Balzac wrote and what made him famous really was never explored . Perhaps the average Frenchman would know , but for non-French and non-literature majors , this is a glaring omission . A good , though flawed biography - - worth seeing , but perhaps too long and dull for many viewers .
462698	2467618	50598	7.0	very uneven but well worth seeing	This was the last film starring Charlie Chaplin and he went on to do only a very brief cameo in the last film he directed , THE COUNTESS FROM HONG KONG . And , while it lacks the quality of many of his famous full-length films , it is well worth your time . One of the reasons I say that the film lacks quality is the unevenness of the film . While the music Chaplin composed is very good and parts of the film are quite touching , other parts look a bit choppy and some of the camera work is rough . But , considering that mediocre Chaplin is still head and shoulders above most other work , this can all be forgiven . Chaplin plays the deposed benevolent king of a fictional European country . When he arrives in America , he is treated like a celebrity and he intends to make it his new home . However , over time his opinion about living here sours - - partly due to the intensity and shallowness of American culture but mostly due to the zealous anti-Communist movement of the day . The film consists of two parts . The initial portion is pretty light-hearted and involves Chaplin's becoming acquainted with American culture ( such as TV , Rock and Roll and even plastic surgery ) . While I have heard some comment that this makes the movie seem too episodic and lacks focus , I actually liked this part and found it charming - - even though not all the gentle ribbing worked in every case . The second part begins when Chaplin visits an odd " progressive school " in the city . Here children are encouraged to express themselves and avoid inhibitions . In reality , it means that the kids are brats and have absolutely no discipline . This is a pretty funny segment - - particularly when Chaplin is introduced to the editor of the school paper ( actually played by Chaplin's 10 year-old son , Michael ) . This kid ( Rupert ) is incredibly obnoxious and instead of discussing politics with the democratic-natured king , he " speachifies " about the evils of all government and sounds a lot like Leon Trotsky ! Although it is not apparent at first , this little vignette actually changes the course of the film . A bit later , Rupert is seen wandering about New York in the snow all alone . The king sees him and takes pity despite their political differences . He feeds and clothes the kid and Rupert repays him by telling people that he is the king's nephew . Well , people think that because the kid sounds like a Communist that the king must also be one - - leading to a lot of confusion and a few laughs . It turns out that the kid had run away from the school after his parent had been forced to testify before the House Committee on Un-American Activities . The parents admit that they had been Communists in the past but refused to implicate others , so they are jailed for contempt . Next , the committee subpoenas Chaplin to testify while federal agents begin badgering Rupert to get him to talk . This leads to a very tiring and badly written part of the film . On the way to testify , Chaplin gets his finger stuck in a fire hose and he eventually has to charge into the committee room with it still stuck on his hand . Then , the hose gets connected to another hose and turned on - - at which point , Chaplin thoroughly douses the committee . This part of the film just isn't very funny and lasts way too long . Despite this hosing , the scene abruptly ends and newspapers announce that Chaplin is cleared and he is once again beloved by the American people . Why and how this occurs is beyond me , as the last scene ended with the committee charging him with contempt ! It is like there is a missing scene explaining how this all occurred . Regardless , Chaplin is tired of the hysteria about Communism and vows to return to Europe . On the way , he stops to see Rupert and finds his spirit is broken . . . as Rupert was tricked into betraying his parents ' former associates . The film then ends as it shows Chaplin and his trusted aid flying out of New York . While Chaplin denied that this film was an attempt to get back at America for its shabby treatment of him in the early 50s , it is pretty obvious that this movie is a comedic and very poignant attempt to do precisely that . It reminds me a lot of the Woody Allen film THE FRONT , though it preceded it by almost two decades . While it was true that there was significant infiltration of our government by Stalinist spies ( based on recent data released by the Kremlin ) , along with legitimate concerns many innocent people were hurt just because of their political leanings . Chaplin's leftist beliefs and movies that depicted the little guy as being oppressed by an uncaring Capitalist society came back to haunt him during this era of fear . In the end , he was forced to return to Europe to live out the remainder of his life . So , in many , many ways , this movie was an autobiographical film wrapped in comedy . Now as for the good and the bad about this film . The film has many amusing little segments and is quite charming . Its autobiographical aspects make for an interesting insight into Chaplin's psyche and even without that , it is a pretty good film .
459793	2467618	1388792	7.0	A very nice one-man performance	I have seen between 200-400 short films on IMDb and I must say that I can't recall another short like this one . That's because Benjamin Green does a monologue and despite no other actors , he's able to maintain the viewer's attention because he is a very good actor . No doubt the writing and direction helped as well . Regardless , it's worth seeing . The film starts with Green in the tub . He begins talking to the camera about how he's completely screwed up his career as an artist . It seems at his first one man show , he got nervous and had a few drinks . . . a few too many drinks . Instead of being charming , he came off as a boorish jerk and now he's afraid to do anything other than sit and soak and wait . You really have to feel sorry for the guy , as he tells a good story and makes you understand how a guy can get himself into such a mess . The only other comment is that the language is a bit harsh . While it's appropriate to the situation , it makes this a lousy film to show kids .
461724	2467618	312666	8.0	Funny - - - but watch this one when the kids aren't around !	An older lady who seems to be blind invites a young man into her home to look at a couch to see if he wanted to buy it . However , it soon becomes obvious that he isn't interested in the couch but is a dirt bag interested in stealing from this dear old lady . In fact , when she tells him about a very expensive suit her son left there , he decides to steal it . Heck , since she's blind , he also decides to just take off his clothes there and make the switch ! I can't say any more - - it will spoil the twist ending . This is a very strange film that is best watched when the kids aren't around due to the nudity and crude language in the film . While often this turns me off films , it was quite appropriate and resulted in a very funny short film .
464111	2467618	405496	8.0	A must-see for cinephiles	The casual viewer may have little interest in this documentary , but for true lovers of cinema , this is a must-see . Back in the 1970s , when cable was in its infancy and home videotape was unknown , movie lover Jerry Harvey contacted his local cable company to complain about the horrible programming . In an odd twist , they hired him to be a programmer ! Soon after this , the new Z Channel hired him to be their head programmer . Harvey went from being a complete unknown to becoming a cult-like hero to a small group of California subscribers ( where the channel was shown ) . This is because he was very brave in his choices - - often showing art films , unknown films , extended director's cuts ( a first ) and unappreciated films . It seems that his biggest fans were the film makers themselves , as he helped to give exposure to many films that would have otherwise gone into oblivion . Seeing and hearing all the accolades for this cable pioneer was really interesting , but as I said this probably would hold little interest to the casual film viewer who could care less about Truffaut , Berman or Antonioni ( among others ) . However , what becomes fascinating for ANY viewer is the man himself . Harvey was a very disturbed man who had a lifetime of demons and personal baggage - - so much that he ultimately killed his wife and then himself . The film's examination of why this occurred is interesting , but also very unsatisfying because so little is known about his childhood . His two sisters killed themselves ( though there is a tiny doubt about what happened to one of them ) , his father is dead and his mother is very emotionally constricted . So the film chooses to spend much of its focus on the impact of this murder-suicide on those who knew him . What I appreciated was that although many voiced their sadness at his passing and talked about what a great person he was , some others ( particularly in the very end of the film ) were understandably angry about what he did and find it wrong to elevate this guy to sainthood - - after all , he did murder his wife . As a psychology teacher and ex-psychotherapist , this reaction is by far the most fascinating part of the film . By the way , although this is a wonderful film , the film maker Ms . Cassavetes chose a lot of clips for the documentary that are NOT family-appropriate . While there's quite a bit of nudity , most of it isn't salacious and is from art films . However , some of the scenes are borderline pornographic and the scene of Rutger Hauer masturbating makes this a film you DON'T show your kids . Too bad the film included one or two of these clips - - it might alienate some in the audience and wasn't needed to tell the story .
461200	2467618	35020	8.0	Full of many wonderful moments and performances	This is a lovely little romantic-comedy that actually has a lot more to say than first meets the eye . Mousy college professor Henry Fonda is married to flighty Olivia DeHavilland . She is excited because an old boyfriend is coming to town for the big homecoming game at the college . Fonda is less excited because this old boyfriend ( Jack Carson ) is both obnoxious and not all that bright - - yet Carson is a big hero because he was an All-American football player . Fonda's distaste is well-founded , as Carson is a jerk and DeHavilland becomes an idiotic " fan girl " . This naturally makes Fonda feel very inferior , though this inferiority is made worse because DeHavilland is an idiot . On one hand , she admires Carson for his manliness , but on the other she encourages Fonda to give up his intellectual integrity to get along with the fascist-like college president . My wife and daughter watched this film with me and they both instantly hated DeHavilland and I can't say I blamed them . This is one of her less likable roles ( heck , I liked her more as a person even in HUSH HUSH SWEET CHARLOTTE ) . At the same time all this is occurring , there is a similar but lesser plot involving Herbert Anderson ( otherwise known as Dennis the Menace's dad from the TV show ) . He wrote an article about intellectual integrity and fascism creeping into our schools and instead of being applauded for standing up for the American system , he is attacked for being a " red " . Later , when Anderson and Fonda get together to complain about their lots in life and share a few drinks , the film switches into comedic high gear - - as both ( particularly Fonda ) become roaring drunk and it is handled in a very funny way . I particularly liked when Fonda then attacked Carson and tweaked his nose ! At the end , there is a nice little showdown scene in the film highly reminiscent of the stand taken by Jimmy Stewart in MR . SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON . Everything is wrapped up perfectly and everyone lives happily ever after - - huzzah ! This is just a lovely old fashioned film - - quality throughout and with a great message about intellectual integrity in our colleges . Unfortunately , I am not sure how many people learned from this film , as the right-wing repression of the early 40s and " red scares " have in some schools been replaced with left-wing repression and " political correctness " during the last couple of decades . Too bad , as the prospect of BOTH is enough to nauseate me .
458449	2467618	210853	8.0	If you liked THE DANISH POET , you'll probably like this one as well .	The film begins with a brief history lesson about Norway after achieving independence . The people actually voted to have a king and this short is a very silly story about the woman who ironed this man's shirts . While there's not a huge amount of depth to it , the film has a very likable quality about it and a kooky but subtle sense of humor . The maker of MY GRANDMOTHER IRONED THE KING'S SHIRTS was the same lady ( Torill Kove ) who was responsible for the Oscar-winning short , THE DANISH POET . Both films are very similar - - both are about Norway , both have very similar artwork , both have similar narration and both have a very odd and quirky sense of humor . Both are exceptional , but perhaps THE DANISH POET was ever so slightly better . Sadly , though both films were wonderful , Kove has only made a small number of shorts .
461644	2467618	420223	8.0	Very good and very unexpected	I have been very surprised recently that I have actually enjoyed several Will Ferrell movies . Why surprised ? Well , to put it bluntly , most films made by ex-Saturday Night Live performers have been pretty wretched ( though there are some exceptions ) and I usually avoid them like the plague . With films like DR . DETROIT , NEIGHBORS , A NIGHT AT THE ROXBURY , FUNNY FARM , BEST DEFENSE , HERE'S PAT , etc . , it's easy to understand my misgivings . However , despite my strong bias , I must admit I really enjoyed TALLADEGA NIGHTS as well as STRANGER THAN FICTION - - though they are both very , very different movies . While TALLADEGA NIGHTS is extremely silly and a great parody , STRANGER THAN FICTION is not exactly a comedy , though it has some nice comedic moments . Instead , it's a fantasy , comedy and romance all rolled into one and it was nice to see Ferrell finally underplay a role . His character was extremely obsessive-compulsive and emotionally constricted - - yet this was NOT played for laughs - - an excellent decision . The film initially seems a lot like the old skits on " The Carol Burnett Show " which featured a writer typing a story and you saw actors playing it out as if they were real . However , the simple story idea was drawn out but didn't seem padded and offered some lovely insights into deeper philosophical issues . It was NOT a film for dopey teens or an undemanding audience , but a thoughtful and intelligently constructed film that caught my interest . If you are looking for screwball comedy or lots of laughs , then you will no doubt be disappointed . However , if you watch the film with few preconceptions and expectations and have an open mind , I am sure you'll enjoy the film . It's nice to see that I was wrong about the film and the " SNL curse " did not seem to apply .
458877	2467618	35565	8.0	What a wonderful curio from WWII	This is a very fascinating curio from WWII starring Jimmy Stewart . This is an Army Air Corps recruitment short in which Stewart , after a year in the service , addresses the public to sell them on joining . The film is briskly paced , interesting to watch and has a lot of great footage of aircraft ( particularly interesting to airplane aficionados are the early B-17 A and B versions - - pretty rare to see this footage ) . While I doubt if this film would excite most kids , it is a great film historically . Plus , it is one of the few films Stewart made exploiting his service , as he tended to downplay this and few people actually knew that he eventually retired a Brigadeer General after many years of service . By the way , one of the young guys in the film that was thrilled about joining up had a girlfriend that looks like Judy Garland . It's not - - I checked and it's Juanita Stark . They could have been sisters !
461604	2467618	312859	8.0	Despite a very slow and confusing start , stick with this film	Last night , I saw A PECK ON THE CHEEK ( KANNATHIL MUTHAMITTAL with English subtitles ) . Oddly , it was 137 minutes long - - slightly longer than the time listed on IMDb . At first , I found myself losing interest in this film because the rather confusing style of filming really lost me . The context for what was occurring was missing and I am glad I stuck with it . At the beginning , a young couple is married and shortly after the wedding , war breaks out in their native Sri Lanka and the lovers are separated . Months later , the wife is very pregnant and on board a refugee vessel heading to India . At a refugee center , you see the lady about to give birth - - after which the titles to the film finally are revealed . The entire focus of the film then changes completely - - to a young girl who is about to turn 9 in Madras , India . You see her in her home and she talks to the camera about her life and family . None of this seems that interesting or important and you wonder what is missing - - what about the lady who was about to give birth ? My wife and I debated this and we finally guessed that this little girl was actually the child of the lady in the first part of the film . Somehow or another , she had been adopted and was talking about her life with mom and dad # 2 - - though she did NOT realize these people were not her biological parents . Soon after this , the parents revealed themselves to be total idiots ( one of the complaints I had about the film ) , as they decided to tell this very young girl the truth about her parentage AND tell it in a way that left the girl emotionally screwed up and confused . Despite a stupid decision and telling her in the worst way , the parents made up for this by agreeing to help her find her biological mother . Seeing the impact all this had on the girl and parents ( particularly the adoptive mother ) was impressive to watch and sure sparked my interest . Unfortunately , Sri Lanka has been involved in a very , very long and brutal civil war with Tamilese militants , off and on , for three decades . The family's decision to look for the mom back in Sri Lanka was indeed noble , but also a bit stupid at times - - as they took so many risks and nearly got killed again and again by just blindly jumping into the middle of a war ! This was all exciting and captivating but also left me wondering about the sanity of the adoptive parents - - first you tell her she ISN'T your biological child and now you take her in the middle of a WAR ZONE ! ! ! Sure , the kid really wanted to meet her biological mother , but this really was stupid in hind sight . If it were me , I might have been tempted to pay an unemployed actress to play the part and fool the kid - - thus avoiding being in the middle of a war ! Despite my complaints , the film was lovely to watch and was very rewarding . Far from perfect , it sure hits an emotional home run . Also , while I expected this because I have seen several Indian films , many Westerners will be a bit surprised by the vivid songs that seem to come out of no where - - this IS standard in most films from India - - including those made in Bollywood ( Bombay ) and Tamilwood / Kollywood ( Madras ) .
462437	2467618	1009	8.0	Is this a film by J . Stuart Blackton or Georges Méliès ?	I watched this short silent film online tonight and it was identified as a film by the genius French director Georges Méliès . However , when I looked on IMDb , it said it was by J . Stuart Blackton ! Obviously SOMEONE is wrong ! While watching it , I sure thought it was a Méliès film because it was so creative and the camera tricks were so masterfully done . If it IS a Méliès film , then it's pretty typical of the amazing stuff he did . If it is NOT , then obviously by 1909 other directors starting imitating his style and techniques . Regardless WHO is responsible , it is a cute and interesting little film well worth seeing - - particularly by Cinephiles like myself . If you want to see this movie yourself , you can see it online at http www archive org search php query melies
462394	2467618	51622	8.0	The ONLY Fly movie you must see - - with a terrific ending to boot	Okay , up front you ought to know that I absolutely hated the remake of this film starring Jeff Goldbloom . I felt the remake had zero subtlety or charm and was just a special effects-laden and grotesque movie . If you care , look for my review of this film to see just how much I hated it ( and my hatred of this film is INTENSE ) . Probably so much of why I hated the disgusting remake was because the original film was everything the remake was not - - it was charming , low budget , effective and campy fun . The film is about a scientist who has a basement lab . He's working on a device to teleport things from one place to another ( kind of like a Star Trek transporter ) . It works great , but when he makes the trip himself , a fly buzzes into the chamber and the DNA of him and the fly become fused - - producing a human-sized creature with a giant fly head and arm ( it's so coooool when you finally see him without a sheet draped over his head , as he was during so much of the movie to avoid scaring his wife ) . Attempts to find the fly-sized creature with a human head and arm are totally unsuccessful , so eventual the fated scientist shoves himself into a press and squishes himself . The police suspect that this was just a murder , and they want to charge the scientist's wife . All looks bleak until the very final scene ( one of the most memorable ones in screen history ) when the detective hears a screaming fly calling for help - - just before it is devoured by a spider . You see a little human head and hear him screeching in a high pitched voice " HELP ME ! " . What a cool scene . The film also stars Vincent Price , who actually plays a normal person , not the bug-man . However , he does return for a sequel and you can guess what happens to Vincent in that one ! This is great campy fun - - a not to be missed film for horror movie fans .
458503	2467618	404032	8.0	Despite a couple poorly written performances , an excellent film that is NOT exploitational or even a horror film	I liked this movie a heck of a lot more than I thought I would , as I had little interest in seeing a horror film ( this just isn't a genre I enjoy most of the time ) . A lot of this was because the movie really wasn't a horror film per se , but a courtroom drama following the death of a supposedly possessed girl as well as a film that discusses the possibility of demonic possession - - though this is handled in a pretty ambiguous way and with no easy or pat answers . I could see people who say demonic possession can be explained away by natural phenomena AND those who believe in its existence both enjoying this interesting and thought-provoking film . It probably won't offend religious people nor will like likely offend others - - it's just a good film . It's even more interesting when you learn that the story is based on a real case , though artistic license was used in making this film ( just how much , I don't know ) . Despite an excellent script , excellent acting by the actress playing " Emily Rose " and a real creepy mood , there is one problem with the film and that is the acting by BOTH the prosecuting and defense attorney in the film . The prosecutor seemed too wooden , angry and unprofessional to be real and I truly doubt if his histrionics in the courtroom would have been tolerated by a sane judge . Likewise , the defense attorney , at times , seemed rather dumb and presented nearly as poor a case at the prosecutor . Plus , the average person probably could have done a better job than they did ! I really wonder if the writers ever consulted with real lawyers to find out how to create these roles - - they just were not believable and tended to detract from the rest of the film . Still , despite this serious complaint , this IS a good film - - though I really doubt if it's a good idea to let young kids see this due to the subject matter . Also , if you get a chance , see REQUIEM . This is a German-made version of the exact same case of Anneliese Michel - - the inspiration for both stories . Both are very good but have a much different focus .
462929	2467618	473444	8.0	So spectacular , you should see it once	While this is far from my favorite Chinese movie , it is one I strongly recommend you see simply because of its spectacular battle sequences in the last third of the film . While it's obvious in places that lots of CG technology was used , it still is amazing seeing battle sequences that come close to those from the Lord of the Rings films in grandeur and scope . The plot itself reminds me a bit of A LION IN WINTER and I , CLAUDIUS since it follows the very dysfunctional machinations of the emperor and his family . After a while , it becomes a bit difficult figuring who's scheming against who and keeping track of all the amoral actions of the cast that make them seem much like a more dysfunctional and power-made group than the famed Borgias of Italy ! All this is done in amazing style and grace , though the first third of the film might seem a bit too slow for many . I'll concede this is a bit true , but urge the viewer to stick with it - - the film inexorably draws to an amazing conclusion in which 1000 extras were employed in a huge battle in which it appears that about 50000 troops were fighting to a very , very bloody death . And please note that I did say " bloody " . This film earned an R rating even though there is no nudity and the language is rather tame - - all because buckets and buckets of fake blood are used and the deaths are at times very brutal . In closing , there are a couple things to look for . First , the ninja-like assassins are really high on the cool factor . They are of course over-the-top as is some of the action , but it is far more believable and uses far less of the high-flying gadgetry of films such as CROUCHING TIGER , HIDDEN DRAGON . Also , watch the scene were the emperor and his # 2 son have a sword fight near the beginning of the film - - wow is THAT exciting !
460649	2467618	36716	8.0	I loved this silly 40s B-movie	To many , this film will seem pretty silly and insignificant . I admit it . But , for what it was , it was one of the best . This film was meant to be a silly escapist film - - not a " big " movie but a B-movie meant to entertain the kids and adults alike . And , it was a major step up from the average B-western ( which , after seeing a few , looked the same ) . And the audiences loved these silly , yet magical films . This happens to be one of my favorites . Before I even saw it , I saw a publicity photo of the very sultry Maria Montez as the Cobra Woman - - dressed in a turban , evening gown and lounging across a giant cobra statue . Considering I was about 13 or so , I think I fell in love ! I HAD to see this hot lady in the film ! Well , when I finally located a video of it years later , I finally had my chance ( though by then , I had found my own " Cobra Woman " and didn't have quite the same pressing need as when I was a teen ) . It was silly but intensely exciting - - with lots of action , campiness and Jon Hall as the only man virile enough to tame this " she-beast " ! I loved it and wanted to see it again - - it was magical and just plain fun ! See it and enjoy unless you are a super-sophisticated person . I love foreign films and art films but sometimes I just gotta have some mindless B-movie fun !
463482	2467618	19574	8.0	A very good film . . . and made three years before the more famous TABU	This is the tale of a doctor who is disgusted at the greed of the White sailors who plunder and exploit the Polynesian natives . Risking their lives to retrieve huge pearls , the locals are given mere trinkets . And , when a few die , the Whites take no heed . But , when the doctor has had enough and verbally attacks these " businessmen " , his is tied to the wheel of a ship full of plague victims and cast adrift . Fortunately , he finds an unspoiled island full of sweet villagers . Will the wicked White men come and destroy this paradise , too , or will the doctor find the peace he so craves ? The film has amazingly good cinematography and it's nice to see that the crew went to Tahiti to film . Additionally , the film is innovative because it's MGM's first sound film , though like most of these early films , it is NOT all-sound , but uses some synchronized music and sound effects . At the time , audiences were spellbound - - today it just seems like a nice silent film with some added sound and nothing more . The story is very good and compelling , though at times a bit too earnest and preachy about those " White Devils " and their greed . I am a huge fan of F . W . Murnau , the great German director . While he did some wonderful and very advanced films ( such as NOSFERATU , FAUST and THE LAST LAUGH ) , somehow the final film in his career ( TABU , 1931 ) has also been accorded ' classic status ' - - even though it was a silent film made in 1931 . In addition , you can't help but think that Murnau was copying WHITE SHADOWS IN THE SOUTH SEAS - - as the films seem very similar to me . However , WHITE SHADOWS was an innovative film with synchronized sound and music . By 1931 , sound was the standard in many nations and Murnau's making a silent seemed a bit out of date . If I had to watch just one of these films , I'd pick WHITE SHADOWS .
459519	2467618	143012	8.0	a better than average Zatoichi flick	This Zatiochi movie stands out from most of the others because of his relationship with the adorable , but bratty little boy . This is the same little boy who gives Ichi a hand full of pebbles and tells him it's candy ! Despite his brattiness , a strong bond of friendship develops between them and it is with much hesitation that Ichi leaves the boy at the end of the movie . The boy chases him through the crowd , with Ichi quickly tries to lose him . This was NOT done because the kid was annoying but because a kind monk helped him realize that keeping the boy with him was not good , as the violent lifestyle Ichi leads is NOT a good influence . Once again , Ichi chooses to abandon someone who loves him at the end of the movie - - for their own good , but with a lot of heartbreak for both .
460924	2467618	384568	8.0	While not a new idea , it sure was handled well	The idea of a world-weary gunslinger from the Old West who is tired of young punks trying to prove something by fighting them is not new . The best film about this was Gregory Peck's THE GUNFIGHTER and there have been several Westerns about this very topic . In addition , there was even a " Twilight Zone " episode about pool sharks ( with Jonathan Winters and Jack Klugman ) that appeared inspired by this " you don't really want what you think you want " theme . Because of this , I don't think the film deserved the 10 that another reviewer gave it . Plus , the types of gunfights you see in many Westerns simply didn't happen in real life - - this is all Hollywood fiction . However , it's very , very important for me to also point out that this is still a truly amazing film . For a first film , Joshua Sikora has really scored a bullseye . Despite a derivative script , the rest of the film worked exceptionally well . The music was simply amazing and worked very well with the film . In addition , the direction and cinematography looked very professional . So , I am expecting great things from Mr . Sikora because for a first effort , it's really outstanding .
460430	2467618	19504	8.0	VERY familiar material , but it still will make you laugh !	This Laurel and Hardy silent short might seem very familiar to Laurel and Hardy fans even if you've never seen the film before . That's because it uses a formula that worked well in many of their shorts . Basically , Stan and Ollie are trying to act tough ( this time spurred on by two cute ladies ) and after a small altercation develops , the two take the " tit for tat " notion to amazing heights . In this case , a tiny fender bender results in car destruction on a massive and hilarious scale . A few Laurel and Hardy films that have used similar plot construction are the great BIG BUSINESS , BATTLE OF THE CENTURY , TIT FOR TAT and the final portion of MEN O'WAR ( which , incidentally ALSO has them playing sailors on shore leave ) . So , if the formula is so familiar , why bother watching TWO TARS ? Well , like the other films listed ( and others ) , TWO TARS is just plain funny . Period . While the first 75 % of the film is mildly funny , seeing the end results of all the destruction . The many , many sight gags are very reminiscent of the Keystone comedies and must have , for the time , cost a lot of money . Now there is a problem with viewing this film , however . There are no DVD sets of the existing prints of all the Laurel and Hardy films . There was a videotape set produced many years ago , but it's out of print . As a result , I know of no place where you can now view this rare Laurel and Hardy film except online . Under Google Video , there's an old Blackhawk films print ( probably taken from an 8 or 16mm home movie ) but there is no incidental music - - just silence . But , even given these limitations , it's still well worth finding and watching . Not the best Laurel and Hardy film , it IS among the better ones this fine team produced . FYI - - This short is currently playing at the Museum of Modern Art in New York with organ accompaniment . I have no idea how much longer this will be , but it's sure worth seeing - - even if much of the art in the museum is too sophisticated for 99 % of the public .
461553	2467618	453196	8.0	Pretty clever stuff	This is a very clever little French film that does a good job of setting up a tense situation and providing an unexpected comedic twist . The film begins with a flight attendant on an airliner calling desperately to the control tower begging for help - - it seems something has happened to the crew and he is flying the plane ! The tower assures the frightened man that someone will be talking with them shortly via cell phone in order to talk them down safely . The phone then switches to a guy on a cell phone in a car . Unfortunately , he loses his connection and spends the next several minutes DESPERATELY searching for a way to regain contact - - and no matter what he does , it seems to fail ! ! Tense , exciting and very well made - - - this is a short film worth your time .
459013	2467618	472074	8.0	I wish my wife could do that !	A guy gets thrown out of his apartment and is forced to move into the garage in which his girlfriend lives . While you'd think this living situation would be miserable , oddly , the lady seems very happy and seems to love her cramped life . I love my wife and have been very happily married for many years . However , there's something very special about the lady in this short film that I wish my wife could do ! It's not just that this lady has wonderful dreams every night and wakes up happy and rested . No , there's a lot more to it than that ! I'd say more , but I'd hate to spoil the fun . This independent short is well written and acted . Most importantly , it's NOT like other films I have seen - - being a rare case of a truly original film .
459252	2467618	1319581	8.0	The story of a man's love for a sheep . . .	Despite my very accurate summary , this film about a man's love for his sheep is NOT a sick and depraved film but a documentary about a hermit , of sorts , and the lost sheep he adopts . Long ago , Peter moved to the middle of nowhere and after decades of isolation he happened upon a lost sheep and he raised it . However , after some time , the sheep seems much more like a dog or family pet and Peter realized it would be best to return Ben the sheep to a flock . So with obvious emotion reminiscent of the film BORN FREE , Ben is reunited with his fellow sheep . Despite a very odd topic for a film , this short documentary manages to deliver thanks to good camera-work , music and the ability to make this story seem interesting . A nice job all around . . . and NOT to be confused for a film about a man who is strangely attracted to a sheep !
460031	2467618	992976	8.0	Very polished and poignant	This is a well made short film about a man who makes bad choices . And , it seems that this film all takes place within a very small period of time as Joseph Henry day dreams about his life , his loves , his childhood and regrets . In many ways , the short reminded me of the Disney film , THE KIbut with a much edgier look and feel . Speaking of look and feel , the biggest star of the film is the music and excellent cinematography . It gave the film a very polished and poignant attitude that really created an effective mood . Now I am not saying that the story or acting are bad ( they certainly were not ) , but to me the mood was the most memorable part . I can see that the film's writer / director ( Phil Allocco ) has done several other films and I am not surprised , as the film shows great skill .
459353	2467618	33582	8.0	For a low-budget film , it really delivers	This film stars Peter Lorre as an exceptionally nice guy who immigrates to America . Unfortunately , shortly after his arrival , he's in a horrible fire and his face is horribly burned . Because he looks so awful , no one wants to hire him and out of sheer desperation , he resorts to a life of crime in order to earn the money needed to buy a mask to hide his ugliness . Where exactly the film goes from there , you'll just need to see for yourself . I scored this movie an 8 because , for the money spent to make it , it's a heck of a good film with a lot of good twists in the plot to keep it interesting . The film could have degenerated into a simple horror or crime film , but it goes far beyond this an offers some genuine surprises . In addition , the excellent acting by Lorre shows that he was capable of more than just supporting roles . This is an excellent film and delivers more than most " A-pictures " of the day .
458925	2467618	122459	9.0	a highly underrated " chick flick " that guys will also enjoy	I have never understood why this film wasn't more popular or why it's score on IMDb is so mediocre . There is so much going for this film , it's a wonder ! While I will admit that the plot itself is a bit contrived , in most " chick flicks " you are expected to suspend disbelief , so this isn't a big problem . Just think about SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLit has a GREAT reputation and is at least as contrived and was , to me , a less entertaining film . David Duchovney is very happily married when his wife unexpectedly dies . Her heart is transplanted into the sickly Minnie Driver who now has a new lease on life . Later , Driver and Duchovney meet and fall in love - - and then find out about their odd connection ! While of course the plot is odd , it is carried off so well and the romance is so sweet , it still works . PLUS , the best aspect of the movie that make it so precious and entertaining is the wonderful supporting cast . Carol O'Conner , Robert Logia and other old guys play Minnie's father and his friends and they are just too wonderful ! Their lives and adventures as they spend all that time at Minnie's home is just so much fun to watch - - you can't help but love the old guys and believe that their love for Minnie is deep and true . See it yourself with someone you love - - you won't be disappointed .
464216	2467618	405473	9.0	I love this film's ambiguity	This short was one of a collection entitled " Shorts : Volume 4 " . The prior collections have all been terrific and are highly recommended for people who love the genre . The film is set in two places - - in modern day Iraq as well as back in the United States . It seems that an Iraqi-American is in the US military and you see the occupation through his eyes as well as what life is like for his wife and son in the States . What I really love about this film is that it is NOT a diatribe trying to convince the viewer that one side or the other is right or wrong . In fact , it is deliberately ambiguous - - with the viewer left to guess about the internal dialog of this man as well as the rightness or wrongness of the mission . I honestly could see people from the Right or Left embracing this film and taking from it what they'd like . This is a very unusual balancing act and I love how the film makers get you to think - - something that just doesn't happen often enough . Good acting , sets , direction and script - - this one has it all .
463674	2467618	351817	9.0	A very different sort of Samurai movie	TWILIGHT SAMURAI is a film that will no doubt disappoint some viewers . For people wanting lots of sword fighting and action , it has just two brief fight scenes . For people who like a fast-paced film , it will also be a let down because the film is over two hours long and has a very slow and deliberate pace . Nonetheless , I strongly enjoyed it and thought it one of the better Japanese films I've seen in quite some time . The reason I particularly enjoyed it is that it had a very realistic plot . While films such as THE SEVEN SAMURAI and the ZATOICHI series are fun and abound with great action , the real life of Samurai during the era just before the Meiji dynasty ( about 1850 ) were not like Samurai you'd see in other movies . The fact that Seibei Iguchi is a Samurai AND a glorified accountant is more true to the mundane nature of most of these swordsmens ' lives . Additionally , you find a depth in this humble lower-level Samurai than you'd find in most other films of the genre . Despite the stereotype , he'd much rather avoid a fight and takes his greatest pleasure in life being with his family . He is not involved in intrigues and macho posing but is instead a man very content with his simple lot in life . Because of this , you'll very likely find yourself really caring about the guy and hurting for him when his life is in turmoil . You also feel horribly for him because he cannot have the woman he loves . Exceptional acting , great direction , a lovely script and amazing fight scenes ( though brief - - the first one really is amazing ) - - this is a wonderful film that justifiably was nominated for the Best Foreign Film Oscar . Unfortunately , the winning film that year , BARBARIAN INVASIONS , was even better - - I know , I've seen both films . Still , losing to this wonderful French-Canadian film is nothing to be ashamed of in the least !
462633	2467618	359	9.0	One of many weird " head " movies from Méliès	The very early French film director Méliès was super-famous for his trick cinematography . He deserved this fame for such standout films as Le Voyage Dans le Lune and I personally think he was the greatest movie maker of his age . Compared to Edison and Lumiere's films , his movies were always superior - - featuring great sets , stories and camera-work . And , compared to later luminaries such as D . W . Griffith , I think Méliès ' films are much more watchable today . This film features the director's disembodied head as the star . Believe it or not , this was not very unusual for Méliès , as I have seen several films where his disembodied head performs ! This is very clever and funny and it differs in this case because the head it enlarged again and again using a pump until it ultimately explodes ! And , for the year it was made , it looked amazingly real ! Funny stuff indeed . If you want to see this film online , go to Google and type in " Méliès " and then click the video button for a long list of his films that are viewable without special software .
462278	2467618	872222	9.0	Grab a Kleenex . . .	Wow . I was surprised that I liked this short film as much as I did - - it was well worth seeing and is a great example of how good and profound a short can be . While it appears to be a documentary , I think that it is in fact a fictionalized story . The film is narrated by the main character - - a Haitian woman who has come to the United States and is desperately trying to fit in with American culture while also denying her own Creole roots . The problem , however , is that she can't do this - - no matter how hard she tries . Part of this is due to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder , as things she sees in everyday life remind her of the pain and violence of life in Haiti . Part of this is also the eventual realization that not everything from her native culture is bad - - and much of it should be celebrated . The reason I scored this film so high is that it really packed a big emotional wallop . At one point , I was tearing up because the film really pulled me in and wouldn't let me go . A wonderful example of direction , writing and acting all coming together perfectly .
460317	2467618	34941	9.0	A terrific little B-picture	This is a wonderful little picture from MGM as it delivers on all levels . Unlike many " B-pictures " , this film features better production values , better characters and a much better written script than usual . While MOST B-movies have plot holes and logical errors , this one is very tight and interesting and seems superior to the usual detective films . Van Heflin plays a brilliant forensic scientist who works for the police . In many ways , he seems like a 1940s version of the TV show CSI - - but his assumptions and equipment seem rather realistic and less fantastic than the shows we see on television today . For example , when Van finds what MIGHT be evidence , he is very hesitant to make huge logical leaps and is very cautious and thorough . In addition , he uses standard equipment of the day to investigate the crimes ( whereas , CSI often features procedures that are NOT really used today ) . Van is ably assisted by the pretty Marsha Hunt - - who Van seldom seems to recognize for her many talents . Finally , after seeing no reaction from him , she begins to date the District Attorney and they become quite serious . There's a lot more to the story than this , but I don't want to spoil it . Just be prepared to be impressed by an intelligently written and acted film - - and much of the credit should go to the great director , Fred Zinneman , who is able to get the absolute most from the material . It's not surprising to find that Fred went on to better and more prestigious projects - - probably thanks to his success with little films . FYI - - Although the forensics are pretty good , at one point Van picks up what's left of a pipe bomb with his bare hands . What about fingerprints ? !
459261	2467618	420022	9.0	Wow , is this a weird one !	When this short film begins , you are immediately struck by the set design and props . Aside from the main character , all the other " people " are white mannequins with what looks almost like television screens for heads . What also is very arresting is the " assembly line " quality of the film . The guy doesn't walk but is whisked along on a conveyor belt for much of the film . Given that short films these days invariably have very low budgets , it's a testament to this film that they managed such a flashy looking and futuristic look with what must have only been a few thousand dollars . As for the story , it's very weird as well and is , for a while , very slow and repetitive . This is intentional , as the story appears to be about alienation and detachment . Just bear with it - - the film manages to end very well and make quite a profound statement about life or perhaps society or perhaps our modern world or perhaps it's just intended to make our heads hurt ! All I know is that the film hooked me and really had an impact by the time it was complete . Give this one a look .
461852	2467618	53133	9.0	one of the best Noir pictures - - not to be missed	This film appeared a little later than the average Film Noir flick , coming out in 1959 . However , being just a few years newer isn't a bad thing . In fact , as American sensibilities were changing and racial awareness was now fair game in Hollywood , they combine to produce a terrific film . The real standout star in the film is Robert Ryan . His character is highly reminiscent of the bigoted bully from his earlier film , CROSSFIRE . But , in this case he also has a lot of prison time and a wasted life behind him because he has an enormous chip on his shoulder and is just chock full of rage . This character was very well-written , as the writers really understood the antisocial personality and combined it with a slimy coating of prejudice . This film could most likely not be made the same way today in this era of political correctness and this is a shame as bigotry is best served directly and unflinchingly . Ryan's nemesis throughout much of the film is Harry Belafonte . Although they are both crooks working the same heist , Ryan's hatred of anything black can't help but set the men against each other - - especially since Belefonte is both proud and very confrontational . This relationship really results in some amazing chemistry . Other very notable performances come from Shelley Winters as the long-suffering girl who keeps waiting for Ryan to make good and Ed Begley as the mastermind behind the bank job . Combining all this exceptional acting and writing with top-notch direction from Robert Wise , and you've got a real winner ! ! About the only Noir film that I like more that immediately comes to mind is THE KILLER ( 1946 ) . Also , this film is highly reminiscent of THE KILLING - - another terrific Noir classic .
463394	2467618	36149	9.0	an overlooked gem !	I was amazed when I saw this picture . After having seen The Horn Blows at Midnight , I had assumed that all of Jack Benny's pictures were pretty stupid and that his talent only extended to television and radio . Boy was I wrong . This very short movie ( 57 minutes ) is outstanding and I have nothing negative to say about it . Benny is actually NOT the Meanest Man in the world but perhaps one of the nicest in the film . This is a real surprise because he is a lawyer ( sorry to all you lawyers reading this ) . However , he finds that if people THINK he is mean and heartless his business will pick up considerably ! If it comes on TCM or you can find it on video , give it a try . You're bound to love it ( unless YOU are the meanest man in the world ) .
463356	2467618	434693	9.0	This one's for all the frustrated Invader Zim fans !	I am a strange person in that I am post-40 and still enjoy cartoons as much as when I was a kid . One of the more recent cartoons I have particularly enjoyed is the totally bizarre and seemingly pointless INVADER ZIM . Unfortunately , the show was just too weird and edgy for Nickelodeon and it was quickly canceled , though it has a very strong cult following . Apart from one season of shows , though , there just isn't much ZIM out there . And in light of this , I am strongly recommending Keroro gunsô ( Sgt . Frog ) . The show is very , very similar in so many ways . BOTH star a totally inept short little guy who comes to Earth to dominate and conquer us for their empires and both are so hopelessly inept that they haven't a prayer ! The only major difference is that Sgt . Frog isn't quite as bizarre or high energy . Instead of insanely over-the-top action like ZIM , Sgt . Frog is a slower paced and sweeter character - - a lot more cuddly and cute than ZIM . Plus , for all you GIR lovers ( he's ZIM'S robot helper ) , there isn't a corresponding character in Keroro gunsô . For this reason , I like this series a little less , but still recommend you give it a try .
461343	2467618	105946	9.0	one of the best sci-fi series , . . . . period	Although I know that the Trekkies out there and lovers of SG-1 will no doubt blow a gasket , I consider this the best sci-fi series ever . And I DO like these other shows ( even the ever so mediocre Deep Space 9 ) . My love for the show is based on it having the creative genius of J . Michael Straczynski creating and controlling the series . Unlike other shows , he was a single mastermind who envisioned a series with a greater sense of purpose and plot than others ( and wrote almost all the episodes ) . His plots did not last a few episodes or even a single season , but persisted throughout . And , because of this , his characters were able to grow and evolve unlike any others in the history of sci-fi . It was ingenious how G'Kar and Molari , for example , changed throughout the series . It was also genius to have humans be both the BEST and WORST characters in the show - - from the evil Bester ( played by EVIL CHEKOV from the " Mirror Mirror " episode of Star Trek ) to the strong and competent Commanders Sinclair and Sheridan . I will warn you , though , that the first season starts slowly , as it takes a while for all the characters to be introduced and for all the man , many plots and schemes to start coming together . In fact , in season one , there are even a few poor episodes that show that the series hadn't yet gotten its legs . My advice is HOLD ON AND KEEP WATCHING - - later the true brilliance of the intricate plot become very apparent . Seasons two , three and four are amazing , though unfortunately season five is also a bit of a dud because the show was originally scheduled to end after four and the fifth season was sort of slapped together - - and it looks it . If you disagree with me , I challenge you to watch every episode from start to finish and then tell me I am wrong . I guess I am a true GEEK , as I have seen them all as they originally aired and no other series ( except NOWHERE MAN , STARGATE SG-1 and THE PRISONER ) ever got me to commit myself to seeing every episode .
460823	2467618	1073216	9.0	Another great picture from Michael Gluzman and Brad Tucker !	Michael Gluzman and Brad Tucker both co-directed this film as well as a terrific follow-up picture in 2008 , ALL THAT IS HUMAN . While both are very young and inexperienced in film making , I am blown away at the quality of both these productions . For student films , they are unbelievable ! FANYA KAPLAN is an interesting little film about a little-known figure from history who tried to assassinate Lenin after the Communist revolution " went sour " and the party began limiting free speech and basic human rights . Although I teach history , my knowledge of the event was at best sketchy , so I enjoyed finding out more about this abortive attempt on Lenin's life . Ironically , considering how many of Kaplan's friends were executed and how Lenin's successor , Stalin , was so blood-thirsty and demented , the incident probably did much more harm than good . What I loved about the film is how the film makers made the movie in Russian and the trouble they went to in oder to get that right . Also , for the money spent , it was a very professional and I am amazed that these young people have done a great job both times they worked together . Great stuff .
463424	2467618	52600	10.0	Brilliant - - one of the better and more heart-wrenching war pictures	This is a wonderful movie from the Soviet Union that follows one simple soldier for the course of less than a week . Pvt . Alyosha Skvortsov is on the battlefield running from an oncoming German tank . He is scared half to death but manages , in his panic , to jump into a fox hole where he finds a bazooka-like gun and destroys the tank . Moments later , another German tank appears and he dispatches that one as well ! The German tanks not hit are in a panic and make a hasty retreat . Later , the private is brought to the general where he is congratulated and told he would get a medal for his bravery . Skvortsov instead asks if perhaps he could have a pass to see his mother - - and the general agrees . However , the pass is only for a few days and despite Skvortsov insisting he could make it home in a day or so , there is a war on and it takes so much longer to get home than he anticipated . In fact , he is taken from touching vignette to touching vignette - - all told marvelously and with such heart . One soldier who sees him heading away from the front begs him to stop on the way home and bring some soap to his wife and tell her he is okay . How this all works itself out was amazingly honest and touching . Even more touching was the one-legged veteran he meets who is also on the way home . The guy doesn't believe that his wife would like him back - - particularly with the injury . But , Skvortsov is such a decent guy that he takes time out of his leave to force the guy to go home and not run away . This leads to one of the most touching reunions you'll ever see . Additionally , the young soldier also happens to meet a pretty young lady on a train and falls in love with her ( reminiscent of the film THE CLOCK ) . Ultimately , he does arrive home for an all-too-brief moment where you'll likely shed a tear or two . The film is marvelous and honest . Instead of the jingoistic propaganda film this would have been had it been made during the war , a few years had passed and the film has a more realistic focus . The extreme bravery , fear , decency and bad in people are all explored and as a result the film seems so real . Also , the whole look of the war was achieved so well . The German tanks are actually German tanks ( thanks to countless tanks abandoned by fleeing Germans during the war ) - - something you just don't see in American films because they aren't available . The battlefields look stark and vivid . And , in a good nod to realism , one soldier eats canned meat that clearly has an American label on it ( something Stalin NEVER would have allowed in a film - - since he ALONE is why the Russians prevailed , or so it would have been portrayed if the film had been made before his death in 1953 ) . I can compare this film favorably to many of the great war films that explore real human beings - - such as THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES or the recent film ENEMY AT THE GATES . A masterpiece of honesty and humanity .
463566	2467618	281724	10.0	Brilliant	Before I start into the film , I should point out that there are two versions of this Finnish documentary about cinema addicts living in New York City . The first I saw was a little less than a hour long and there is a longer version that was for theatrical release . Having now seen both , I actually prefer the shorter TV version because the interviews work so much better because of the editing - - with less " dead time " and a tighter focus . Still , both are well worth seeking . My love for this documentary is for two main reasons . First , I teach psychology and have used this film to illustrate Obsessive-Compulsive behavior , various personality disorders and the recently identified phenomenon of " collectors " - - people who hoard items of practically no intrinsic value in a reaction against the shallowness of their lives . Second , with the third largest number of reviews on IMDb as of , I myself am a bit of a cinemaniac - - but not nearly to the degree of those featured on the films . While I do watch a huge number of films ( almost exclusively on VHS , DVD and cable TV ) , I also have a good job , healthy family life and don't think I'm THAT screwed up yet - - and the documentary is a great way to warn me against the dangers of compulsively watching films . This was especially brought to my attention when I noticed that almost all the odd art films they mention in the movie are ones I have seen and often loved . In particular , the one man who adores THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG said a lot of brilliant things about this masterpiece . Scary , huh ? ! I have a bit of a kindred spirit out there ! However , in the case of these rather sad individuals , enjoying the films in a traditional sense isn't possible . They are so obsessed with the details that often they don't stop to enjoy the film itself ! One man has memorized the running times of practically every film ( like a Savant ) and it tears him apart if the film is shortened by even a minute ! Another so obsessively saves every film ticket that she becomes violent if the ticket taker actually rips the ticket in half . And , even more sad , most have no lives or jobs because of this disability or mania . Some of this is because some of these people are indeed mentally ill , but most are not in a legal sense " crazy " - - just possessing very disturbed personalities ( meaning therapy or medication would probably do nothing to change their odd behaviors ) . This film opens up so many discussions for psychology students and sociologists . Much of it is because these people are all a bit different - - with different styles of their obsessions , different mental illnesses or personality disturbances . In a way , a psychology student taking a class on diagnosis could almost make a game of spotting the pathology . As for how this documentary was made , it was made by Finns but is completely in English . Plus , oddly , there is no narration - - the subjects and those who know them are just encouraged to speak for themselves . This was a wonderful choice since it was edited so well - - and narration often ruins a good documentary as it isn't always helpful or needed . Brilliant , shocking and a bit disturbing , this is not for everyone's tastes , but a wonderful film nonetheless . By the way , many who did NOT like this documentary had valid reasons but many did not - - not liking the subjects personality is NOT a valid reason nor that it wasn't a comedy nor was the knucklehead who was angry because the films the obsessed people liked ( mostly art films , foreign films and classics ) were not the same films they themselves liked ! ! ! Hello . . . . anyone out there . . . . . this was NOT the purpose of the documentary . Liking the people or their choices of films was certainly NOT the reason for this great film - - but the pathology and detrimental effects on their lives was ( as most of them did NOT work but were on the public dole due to someone considering this a true disability ) .
461945	2467618	382932	10.0	One of Pixar's best	This film is exactly what Pixar needed to steal the thunder from Dreamworks ' latest release , SHREK III . In many ways , this is very ironic , as one of Pixar's best films , MONSTERS INC . , was overwhelmed when it was released due to the first SHREK's success . I honestly think if SHREK hadn't been such a wonderful movie , people would have noticed that MONSTERS INC . was an exceptional film . Now , Pixar gets some payback with one of their best , RATATOUILLE . Actually , RATATOUILLE is probably Pixar's best film , though I did enjoy TOY STORY II and THE INCREDIBLES . The reason I was so overwhelmed by this story was that it was so highly original and creative - - I simply cannot compare the plot to any other film ( something you can do with THE INCREDIBLES and TOY STORY II ) . Plus , after years of making CG movies , the look is taken to a whole new level in this film - - it just looks breathtaking . Now I need to point out that RATATOUILLE is not as much a kid's movie as its predecessors . Sure , it can be enjoyed by the kids , but the story line is a tad darker and covers an adult concept ( illegitimate birth ) and includes a swear word ( though not one the really " bad " ones , you can be sure ) . Also , while the rats are kind of cute ( and a marketer's dream ) , most of the rest of the story isn't and there are no catchy kid's tunes . No , instead this film is aimed more at teens and adults in its sensibilities - - something that really helped make SHREK a financial gold mine and cursed MONSTERS INC . to be seen ( incorrectly ) as " just a kid's movie " . Amazing animation , excellent writing and , the rarest of rare , a completely original and captivating plot make this a winner and film that will be long remembered . I can't wait to see it again .
463476	2467618	1339127	10.0	An amazingly well done film	Wow , I really liked this film . Despite being about cancer , the film managed to keep a relatively upbeat and funny mood - - something I really appreciated . The entire film is narrated as a long series of film and picture clips appear on the screen . While this style may sound very dull , it certainly wasn't - - as the narrator's dialog was amazingly good - - clever , funny and brilliant . Amazingly enough , IMDb says that ALL this wonderful dialog was written in only one day - - and that's very hard to believe . I loved the rapid fire pace and there were so many great touches I was left with great respect for Matthew A . Steinhart - - talk about talent ( note - - this is NOT his mother and I have never met the man ) . In addition , I adored the funny touches , such as the long list of people that he thanks at the end for , so far , not having sued him ! It takes a very serious subject and manages to make it very , very palatable .
460477	2467618	71175	10.0	It just doesn't get much better than this	This was a made for TV movie based on the Jane Pittman novels . Despite playing as if Miss Jane was a real person who lived to be 110 , I can assure you that it is indeed fiction . However , like Forrest Gump , Miss Jane was a fictional character who was woven into the real American events that defined the Black-American experience for the first hundred years after emancipation . Unlike Gump , this movie has much more significance and poignancy - - making it an exceptional film to illustrate history and social change to subsequent generations . The film begins with a White reporter coming to see Miss Jane and learn about her long and interesting life . This is set against the backdrop of the coming of the Freedom Marchers into the rural South - - as several around Miss Jane have been jailed or worse for demanding equality . Miss Jane's recollections begin shortly before the end of the Civil War and demonstrate how this struggle and yearning for rights is not new , but part of a long and gut-wrenching process that has taken her entire life . The film deserves great praise on so many levels . The novels and script are simply superb writing . Cicely Tyson did an incredibly job playing both a younger Miss Jane and a hundred year-plus character as well . To make all this possible , makeup and prosthetics were used that even today would be admirable . And the direction , music , supporting acting all come together to make a beautiful and very touching film . About the only negatives I can think of are that the film was too short and I would have preferred to see it as a mini-series - - it was THAT good ! Also , the problems and race relations talked about in the film are rather superficial due to these time constraints . Many characters aren't well hashed out because there is only so much you can say in 150 minutes about a time period spanning 100 years . Despite these minor problems , see this film - - it's a must for anyone wanting to see great film making as well as learn how far we have traveled . Plus , it does pack a mighty powerful punch .
460944	2467618	17214	10.0	WONDERFUL and very creative	Wow , this was sure a creative little silent comedy ! The film starts with a meeting of the Liars Club . Each member is trying to outdo each other with their fanciful tales , but they really aren't that good , so one of them stomps off in disgust . He meets an odd little man ( Charley Bowers ) with his head stuffed in the end of a cannon ( why , they never really seemed to adequately explain ) . Charley is so weird and tells the strangest stories , so the guy takes him back to the Liars Club to show him off ! Charley's story concerns a wonderful scientific potion he's created . Just a few drops can do almost ANYTHING ! And , using the best visual tricks of the day I have ever seen , he does the most astounding and unbelievable things ! ! For example , when he meets a lady in a house infested with mice , he uses the formula to make a plant that grows cats ! It looks pretty real as the cats begin rapidly sprouting one after the other ! Even today , such a scene would be very difficult to replicate without computers . It took immense patience and skill to do all the amazing camera tricks in the film . You really MUST see them to believe it ! In the end , not surprisingly , he wins the admiration of the liars but he's very upset when they announce he is the champion liar . The problem is that everything he told them is TRUE !
460343	2467618	158310	10.0	A must-see for Chaplin fans and movie historians	I picked up a DVD of this British series from the National Gallery of Art in Washington , DC and it's fitting that a filmmaker be featured prominently in an art gallery - - especially since this film isn't a biography of Chaplin , but a step-by-step analysis of his working style . They did this by collecting outtakes that had been saved by Mutual Studios as well as through photos and even home movies . At first , I thought this all sounded very dry but as the film continued I realized what a great treasure this is . What I liked in particular was how they took two of his earlier non-Keystone comedies and analyzed the many , many changes the film underwent thanks to Chaplin's obsessive-compulsive film style . Considering what a gift he had for making films , this lengthy style of constructing films is forgivable and even understandable . In addition to analyzing his shorts , the documentary also chooses to analyze CITY LIGHTS as well as THE GOLD RUSH and provides many behind the scenes insights . I really liked this , since GOLD RUSH might just be my very favorite silent film ( though it's hard to say for sure , considering some of the great films of Lloyd and Keaton ) . All-in-all , this is an absolute must for serious film students , historians and lovers of silent comedy . Considering all the pain and trouble they went to in making this film , it's no surprise that it earns a 10 of 10 . FYI - - Fortunately , while this is a nearly perfect film about Chaplin , there are also two wonderful similar documentaries about Harold Lloyd ( " American Masters " , Harold Lloyd : The Third Genius ) and Buster Keaton ( Buster Keaton : A Hard Act to Follow ) - - both written by the same two writers who made this wonderful film . See them all if you get a chance ! ! Also FYI - - On the DVD is a 12 minute segment on how they assembled all the footage for the documentaries . It's worth a look to give you insight into this very laborious process .
