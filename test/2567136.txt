409400	2567136	383995	2.0	How The Quest Was Lost	I can't say I wasn't warned : Everybody and his Uncle Max told me not to waste time on this merde but I wouldn't be told , the lure of a dozen or so French actors playing cameos proved too strong . At a stretch and inasmuch as what passes for a plot involves writer-director-actor Laurent Baffie looking for his car keys this tends to qualify as a ' quest ' film but it's light years removed from the quest for the Grail , Flight , Meaning Of Life etc . Most of the cameos come up front and take the form of rejections - polite or otherwise - of Baffie's pitch but Gerard Depardieu and Alain Chabat appear in the main body of the film though both to no great effect . Chabat has the slightly longer part as a pet shop proprietor who sells Baffie a dog specially trained to locate missing car keys and that's the highlight . I used to think that it was impossible to sink lower than Ali G or the Carry On series but it is , it is .
409394	2567136	354848	2.0	What A Trial	Were I not so lion-hearted dross like this could turn me against French cinema completely . Somehow Christian Leigh has contrived to shoot something that is WORSE than Jean-Luc Godard or Peter Greenaway which is quite a trick . Leigh's idea of film-making is to let his camera linger on a given scene til it runs out of film . Take the scene in the hotel room . Beatrice Dalle is sitting and contriving to brood whilst remaining expressionless . Outside the window traffic passes . A chambermaid - played by Isabelle Huppert's daughter , Lolita Chammah - enters and proceeds to make the bed . From time to time she throws a glance at Dalle . Riveting . Or take the scene in ( presumably ) Dalle's apartment . This is all ultra-modern where even the curves seem angular and metallic . The style is IKEA 22nd century where bookcases are red metal blocks . Dalle begins packing about 3 , 000 books into , what else , large plastic containers . This is accompanied by what sounds like Michael Nyman aged five and just discovering dissonance . Elsewhere Leos Carax , Dominique Reymonde and Daniel Duval make cameo appearances . Watching this merde is a new way to grow old .
409916	2567136	45989	3.0	Lawd , Jim	There are Golden Turkeys and Platinum Turkeys and then there is Laughing Anne . I doubt if four leads have ever been more mis-matched in a movie . Wendell ' Mahogany ' Corey gets top-billing over Margaret Lockwood whose best days were behind her whilst even more bizarrely Forest Tucker and Ronald Shiner share third and fourth spot . The film has one minor distinction inasmuch as it is the only film based on his work in which Joseph Conrad appears as a character narrating his own story over drinks - the device , albeit much less crudely , had worked well some half a dozen years previously when Herbert Marshall portrayed Somerset Maugham in The Razor's Edge and actually interacted with his own fictional creations throughout as well as providing linking narration . The plot , acting , in fact just about everything in the movie will best be served by the application of a discreet veil . For connoisseurs of seriously bad movies only .
409521	2567136	44849	3.0	Forget It	This is a prime example of Lead Souffl√© School Of Light Entertainment . How dire is it ? Let me count the ways . On second thought better not , wed be here all day . It's from that school of Realism where scrap metal dealers wear bow ties and carnations in the lapel whilst presiding over huge totally empty warehouses that would , in a film boasting even a scintilla of realism , be bursting with scrap metal . There's only one employee on view , Harold Lang , who trebles as receptionist , switchboard operator and chauffeur to say nothing of purveyor of smart , sophisticated dialogue . Sample : John McCallum to Lang . ' How does this ( indicating switchboard ) work ? Lang : ' Find out ' . This sets up an intriguing question . Was this film ghost-written by 1 ) Geoge Kaufman and Moss Hart , 2 ) Joseph L . Mankiewicz , or 3 ) Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett . Answers on a postcard , please , to : Do I Look As Though I Give A Big Rat's Ass . Amongst other delights this movie boasts one of the most improbable menage a trois on record with Thora Hird and Vida Hope vying for the attentions of a punch-drunk John Slater , proud owner of a bashed-in face that makes Lon Chaney look like Tom Cruise . The plot ? It is to laugh .
409608	2567136	61955	3.0	So Would The Audience If They'd Known	I didn't see this film under ideal circumstances because due to structural problems with the cinema the seats were facing the screen . I really should know better than to expect anything resembling entertainment from Truffaut but I keep bending over backwards to give him the benefit of the doubt . From frame # 1 this had all the hallmarks of a film made by a student at Film School - on his first day . The script resembled nothing so much as a Swiss cheese . Consider : Shot one ; Julie ( Moreau ) sits on a bed wearing black and about as much expression as a cheese dip . Then she makes a melodramatic attempt to defenestrate but is saved by Mama . Next she's packing a suitcase and lighting out for the train station . All these actions are jerky verging on the spastic and not only are we not told why but frankly we don't CARE . Soon she has singled out victim Number # 1 and pushed him off a balcony . Then on to number # 2 and so on . Then we start getting flashbacks in which her husband is shot on the steps of the church as the happy couple leave after the wedding ceremony . But here's the part that gives Me pause : How did she know there were five men involved in the shooting ( and four of them peripherally at best ) , ascertain their names , track them down . It would have helped to make it a tad more credible if we'd seen her working out as my maths teacher used to say . Eventually one of the victims - the third , I think - explains how it happened ; five bachelors used to meet regularly for a poker game ; by chance the apartment in question overlooked the church . There's a loaded rifle lying around in the apartment as there is , nothing odd there , one of them starts fooling around , focusing on the church spire , a second man intervenes and the gun goes off and so does the bridegroom . Hardly five evil men or even master criminals , just a stupid prank that went wrong . The victim explaining this to Moreau then tells how the five split up and vowed never to meet again which , if anything would make them even harder to trace . I'm quite prepared to believe that in his original novel William Irish aka Cornell Woolrich was a tad more plausible but as we know from Truffaut's infamous essay he's not really interested in well-made screenplays and boy , does it show . The acting ranges from wooden to incompetent , the writing and direction don't even make it to that level .
409871	2567136	56467	4.0	Deadly Affairs	There's clearly a lot of mileage in the seven deadly sins as the several film versions testify . There was a half-decent version in 1952 , ten years earlier than this entry , one that had the advantage of talents like Michele Morgan going for it . It's hard to find anything to like here ; certainly not the Godard segment which is a bigger joke than his breakthrough movie Brainless . In that one he followed Jean-Paul Belmondo with a hand-held camera as he walked up the Champs Elysee and back down again . Anxious to show how far he has come on this time he follows Eddie Constantine as he Drives from the Billancourt studios into Paris proper . Some progress . Elsewhere we have the one about the group of students who pool their resources so that one of them can get laid by a top-of-the-range hooker , a bizarre piece about flies in the soup leading to Armageddon , a Biter Bit episode and other unimaginative segments . Basically it's a waste of sprocket holes .
410017	2567136	92206	4.0	Tooty Flutey	It's well documented - not least by the man himself - that Michael Caine finds it hard to say ' no ' to any offer that comes in over the transom and as if to illustrate this an English Daily newspaper is giving away no less than 14 ' Best Of Breeds ' that today would go straight to DVD . The good news is that readers are obliged to collect the other 13 from applicable outlets , the bad news is that this , the first , was actually inserted in the newspaper in question . How bad is it ? Let me count the ways . Several English actors who should know better but clearly have bills to pay are wheeled out to go through the motions of what may be best described as a Cool rather than Cold War episode - thriller is far too grand a description - in which Nigel Havers gets too pushy for his own good , ' falls ' off a roof and leaves father Caine to get at any truth that might be floating around . Dire .
409068	2567136	102436	5.0	Thanks For WHAT Exactly ?	I have , on occasion , praised Blier and probably I will do so again but not , I fear , this time . The box talks a good game throwing the names of Annie Girardot and Jean-Louis Trintignant around cavalierly , the implication clearly being they are featured players whereas in fact they merely provide cameos and arrive far too late to save what is at best an indulgence . True , Depardieu is on hand earlier and he is never bad despite being saddled with inept characterisation / dialogue etc . Charlotte Gainsbourg is never going to register on my personal radar but that's my problem not hers and she is in good company with the likes of Ludo Sagnier and Vanessa Paradis . Essentially what we have here is the sort of images we MIGHT see if we were able to see instead of just listen to a sea shell .
409225	2567136	890882	5.0	Nice Work If You Can Get It	On the face of it this is every schoolboy fantasy in the world - to have women eager to pay you for sex . Of course those schoolboys think in terms of their peers rather than older dysfunctional women , indeed to a schoolboy 25 is ' old ' so that they would quickly become disabused by the lineup here , which includes a victim of Downs ' Syndrome who is also the youngest ' client ' on display . If none of the women are actually ugly and some not even plain there is still a moral question which must be addressed . Juhe is both husband and father as well as being jobless and stumbles into his new ' profession ' by chance although having done so he takes to it like a duck to water . The film is well made and largely sympathetic and unerotic but the question remains is this a job for a nice Finnish boy and the answer must be no .
408780	2567136	39428	5.0	Gypsy Curse	When you're asking yourself pertinent questions as a film unspools before you it's usually a sign that something is sadly amiss . The first question I asked myself here is WHY , Quentin Reynolds . Okay , the film is going to be a flashback ergo Ray Milland needs someone to tell his story to but given that he is telling it to a fellow passenger on a flight to Paris it could have been any fictional creation . Given the date of the movie , 1947 , it may well be that Reynolds was familiar as a war correspondent but the fact that Milland is telling Reynolds and not Gregory Schmearcase adds nothing to the story . Next question ; as stated , Milland tells his story on a flight to Paris , again , WHY . The story he is relating took place in Germany and that is where his gypsy lover , Dietrich , is waiting for him . So why not a flight to Berlin , Frankfort , Stuttgart or whatever . Leading on from this , one minute he is on the plane - en route , remember , to Paris - in the next shot he is deep in the German countryside rendezvousing with Dietrich and her caravan . How did he get there ? At the beginning of the film , set in September , 1939 - war is declared even as we watch - Milland is a British agent , travelling with a colleague and intent on obtaining a formula from a German chemist . Milland and colleague are arrested , escape and don German uniforms . Having sunk the car in which they escaped , they separate after arranging a rendezvous near a signpost . Milland meets Dietrich , a gypsy , and travels in her caravan . When they reach the rendezvous Milland's colleague turns up in full Bavarian gear and riding a bicycle . How did he acquire these things . It's little things like that , plus the total lack of chemistry between Milland and Dietrich , the fact that director Mitchell Liesen is totally out of his element , being more at home with sophisticated comedy and elaborate sets that tended to mar any enjoyment the movie may have had
409040	2567136	450615	5.0	Dilute To Taste	On paper this might have seemed viable or even plausible ; two very different types of men thrown together by circumstance and embroiled in a ' caper ' , just the sort of thing in fact that Francis Veber does with one hand behind his back . Alas , this is a Francis Veber type film sans Francis Veber so that the result is more embarrassment than laffs . For me Michele Laroque was a major selling point but though prominent on the billing and publicity she has what amounts to a cameo as a bank official . Somehow Daniel Auteuil and Clovis Cornillac , neither naturally comic , fail to spark as a team so that Gerard Depardieu and Pierre Richard can rest easy . The plot won't stand scrutiny under a strong light so I won't subject it to one , suffice it to say that Cornillac is called upon to portray an aristocrat-cum-spy whilst Auteuil weighs in as an interpreter who seizes the chance to exploit the ' expenses ' aspect of a new assignment . For reasons best known to the Producers Tim Piggot-Smith , Jennifer Saunders and John Cleese are also on hand and probably wish they weren't . If you think Mr Bean is funny this'll kill you , otherwise do yourself a favor and watch Double Jeopardy .
409512	2567136	104008	5.0	Could Leave You Cold	With the exception of Godard , of whom one was enough , I've seen fewer films by Rohmer than by any French director - this is about the third - and I can't honestly say that I'm in a hurry to see any more . If , as in the case here , I see a DVD in my library that carries a modest rental I'll give him another try but so far I've seen nothing that makes me want to dash out to Blockbuster and rent everything I can find by him . Those Rohmer films I HAVE seen are , to some extent , interchangeable but that's not the same as having a STYLE ; in Rohmer's case it merely means that the films are clearly shot with a minimum crew , next-to-no budget and a cast of unknowns all of whom appear to be addicted to Valium inasmuch as there are no violent outbursts , tempers are kept strictly under wraps and in lieu of histrionics we get philosophical discussions . This time around the leading female character indulges in a holiday romance that leaves her pregnant and ironically for a filmmaker who sets such great store on philosophy she refuses to dismiss it philosophically as just that , a holiday romance , as ninety nine out of a hundred would , but persists in viewing it as the love of her life . Despite affairs with two other men , both more than happy to settle down with her AND her daughter , she rejects them both until , in a scene worthy of Hollywood at its schmaltziest she boards a bus and takes a seat facing her long-lost love . WOW ! Okay , don't get me wrong , it's watchable but please don't tell me it's anything else .
409273	2567136	379865	5.0	By George , He Hasn't Got It	I read most of the negative reviews and went to see it anyway . I'm lion-hearted . I didn't expect to get much out of the sporting element not being a grid-iron maven but I was hoping for something on the screwball comedy front . Alas . . . For me the main problem was that neither Clooney nor Zellwegger is actually cut out for screwball comedy ; okay , I realize that the days of Bill Powell , Carole Lombard , Cary Grant , Jean Arthur etc have gone forever but I figured if these guys are prepared to give it the old college try why not get behind them . Well , I guess the word I'm looking for is disappointment . On paper they had the makings of a half-decent movie and a smidgin of ' period ' never did anyone any harm . They do , in fact , manage to get something of the ' feel ' of the twenties but the thing is both Clooney and Zellwegger reek of the 90s so what you get is what might happen if a ' flapper ' went on a blind date with a rapper . Nice try but no cigar , hell , not even a cheroot .
409404	2567136	178764	5.0	Off-Key Pirandello	A man loses his memory whilst dressed in clothing totally unconnected to his everyday life . Now why does that sound familiar ? Oh , yes , Pirandello , Henry IV . Great play but this can't be it because there were no songs in Henry IV . What we have here is a road company Henry IV by a writer who wrote only one other screenplay more than twenty years later . This is the movie that really rang the bell for Tino Rossi , who'd been in films - all musicals - since the mid thirties . Of all the Continental films I've seen so far this , I guess , comes closest to meeting their manifesto which was to offer escapist entertainment . In a nutshell Rossi plays Jacques Martin , a popular singer who is appearing on stage in a piece of fluff called The Singing Vagabond and whilst in costume as a bum he suffers total amnesia , takes to the road and winds up on a barge with a pretty girl . Nature takes its course and things are looking good until someone recognizes him and he is returned to his other life . Not to worry though , this is escapist fodder turned out in the middle of the war so everything ends happily . Tino Rossi was something of a French Dick Powell , in other words a joke as a singer but where Powell redeemed himself by proving reasonably adept at dramatic acting and even directing Rossi remained a one-trick pony . This was one of five movies that Richard Pottier directed for Continental and the one that need detain us the least .
409549	2567136	232083	5.0	Will The Real Mika Please Stand Up	Both Huppert and Chabrol are prolific and last year they worked together yet again on a movie light years ahead of this one but when one is prolific one is playing the percentages and winds up with a high chaff to wheat ratio as both have done here . Perhaps most risible is the scene towards the end that appears to be Chabrol's version of the heroine walking the corridors of the Gothic castle at three in the morning wearing only a negligee and armed only with a candle in the full knowledge that there are murderers , maniacs , vampires , perm any one from three , on the loose . Chabrol's take on this is to have a young girl volunteer to drive the car of her hostess along a winding road at night in the full knowledge that the hostess has drugged her drink . Realistically all she had to do was let the hostess , Huppert , drive herself to the pharmacy to collect a prescription , or even , if it comes to that , let the chauvinistic husband ( Dutronc ) pick up his own prescription . This is but one in a series of plot holes that may well be symbolised by the cobweb shawl Huppert is knitting throughout . Children swapped at birth ( well , it was good enough for Shakespeare , Chabrol may argue ) , one of them the child of a forensic lab owner with a boyfriend working there , so convenient for testing possible toxins the spider-woman may be lacing the drinks with . More ? How about this : confronted by a strange girl who claims she may be his daughter Dutronc goes from ' you must be mad ' to ' come and play a little four-hand piano with me ' in minutes . The colors are of that strangely muted type that Chabrol seems to have made his own , the two young actors clearly came in a flat-pack from IKEA and there's a lack of interaction throughout . Isabelle Huppert's Mika runs the gamut from cold-blooded murderess to charming hostess hitting all the stops along the way whilst Jacques Dutronc appropriately turns in a Johnny-One-Note performance . Not one that either Chabrol or Huppert would want to feature prominently on their CVs .
409244	2567136	55605	5.0	Oh ! Henry	Okay , you really dig French movies ; you come across one written by Jean Aurenche and Hernri Jeanson , directed by Claude Autant-Lara and featuring - or so you're led to believe - Danielle Darrieux . What's not to like . Nothing , right , but this is where the expression ' too good to be true ' comes into play . Basically what we have here is a spin on our old friend ' droit de signeur ' , the same thing that got Chuck Heston in a lather in The War Lord , which was made around the same time as this entry . With names like the above involved , to say nothing of Pierre Brasseur , it can't be all bad and Jeanson throws in the odd tasty line the way he might toss a bone to a dog but the French have a saying ' to a good dog , a good bone ' ; in my book I'm a good audience ( dog ) so next time , Henri , make it a better bone .
410086	2567136	59319	6.0	File This Under ' Ho Hum '	Seeing a film like this today it's difficult to know what the target audience was even at the time ; there is virtually no ' action ' and no sex . At one point Harry Palmer ( Michael Caine ) engages in a half-hearted fight with a heavy that is filmed in Long Shot so that the few blows that are struck lose any impact they may have had and the nearest thing to a sex object ( in the James Bond sense ) is about as sexy as Lily Tomlin and there's absolutely no chemistry between her and Caine . If this weren't enough there is the goddam MUSIC . I know John Barry is supposed to be the Man at this game but the stuff he provides here gives the impression it was not written ' to picture ' but that he merely provided a given amount of music - so many yards - specifically for this film but in sections , so many feet of ' tension ' , so many feet of ' chase ' , so many ' stings ' , etc for the Music Editor to cut in as best he could . You know a movie's in trouble when you find yourself listening to and laughing at music that is supposed to be dramatic instead of watching the film . Viewed today this is just an extended version of any ' Avengers ' episode .
408820	2567136	56417	6.0	The Occidental Tourist ( s )	As swan songs go this could have used a decent cygneture tune . The best bit is right at the beginning when , continuing the tradition , Bing and Bob are seen as vaudevillians singing , dancing and pattering their way through ' Teamwork ' , with a lyric from Sammy Cahn , who had replaced Johnny Burke as Jimmy Van Heusen's permanent partner roughly a decade earlier . Plots were never a strong point in the franchise and this is , if anything , worse than most and for some unknown reason Peter Sellars is given several minutes in which to be wincingly embarrassing and utter some of the worst lines in the script . They also jettisoned Lamour as sex object but wisely allowed her a cameo appearance plus a ballad ; her replacement , Joan Collins , failed to register and the best one can say about this product of the famous Rank ' Charm ' School is that she clearly flunked charm . Following the opening vaudeville routine the plot continues in the way of the rest of the franchise with Bing conning Bob - here given Jimmy Van Heusen's real name , Chester Babcock , as an ' inside ' joke - into the usual life-threatening stunts and for good measure we even get a laundry list of previous near-misses including the squid , human cannonball , etc but then it runs out of steam and quickly spirals into complete preposterousness . The banter is still intact albeit a little frayed around the edges but they could have signed off with something a little better than this .
410043	2567136	869994	6.0	La Ronde Squared	If you're shooting a valentine to Paris count me in , even if your name is Cedric Kaplish onlie begetter of the vastly overrated L'Aubere Espanol and , yes , even if your nominal lead is the even more overrated and under talented Romain Duris , for whom you seem to have a permanent hard-on . Alas , the best-laid schemes . . . Probably the strength of this is that Kaplish goes easy on the chocolate-box aspect and gives us more of the ordinary Paris , the one that I , a regular visitor from England , know from walking it's streets en route to one cinema du quartier or another . The film starts promisingly when Duris is told he has a strong chance of dying - something that acting-wise he does in every movie he makes - and then meanders into a labryinth of mini plots and myriad characters until in a blatant steal from Kieslowski's Three Colors : Red , several of them are spotted by Duris from the taxi taking him to hospital . People like Francois Cluzet and Karin Viard are under-used and it is left to Juliette Binoche , Fabrice Luchini and the like to add some class . Kaplish needs a strong script written by someone else to really shine which is why his finest achievement remains Un Air de famille , written by Agnes Jaoui and Jean-Pierre Bacri and it didn't do any harm that the two writers also starred in it . Whilst I'm not prepared to dismiss Paris out of hand I was greatly disappointed .
409238	2567136	953382	6.0	Board Of The Flies	If you're a frustrated hybridologist who's always wondered what a cross between Lord Of The Flies and Bugsy Malone would look like eat your heart out because somebody just beat you to it . I checked this one out blindly on the strength of Carole Bouquet and Gerard Depardieu on the marquee but wouldn't you know it's that old razzle dazzle cause this is strictly a kid's movie any any adult , including the two heavy hitters . The premise is simple if unrealistic ; in what seems to be a remote European village and is definitely one for the picture postcards , the behaviour of the children is so problematical that EVERY adult in the joint takes it on the Jesse Owens leaving the kids to fend for themselves - and when I say every adult that includes non-parents and even people with absolutely no involvement with children . This leaves free rein for the aforementioned hybrid as the kids form naturally into two groups , would-be leaders / tyrants and theoretical victims . It all works out in the end but will anyone care .
408950	2567136	444418	6.0	According To Hoyle	Those who love to detract female directors will probably opine that it is just as well that Nicole Garcia is still acting ( her latest movie is in the Cutting Room even as I write ) and though I confess , as a fan of Garcia the realisateuse , to being a tad disappointed with this entry I can't go along with that lobby who think she should turn in her bullhorn ; she's given us some fine movies in the past and clearly has more fine ones in her . Jean-Pierre Bacri is always going to be an asset to anybody's movie and not just those of his long-time partner Agnes Jaoui , which he also co-writes and here he delivers his best-known persona the miserable grouch which now fits him like a glove . I've never been much of a Benoit Magimal booster in fact the best I can normally give him is that he's the least objectionable of three current French heart throbs the other two being Vincent Cassell and Romain Duris but here he turns in a half decent and sympathetic performance whilst the usually reliable Vincent Lindon seems to be having an off day . Part of the problem is that the film has nothing new to say but insists on saying it anyway ; the plot is our old friend the intersecting lives in a small town where no one is having much fun least of all the audience . On the other hand Garcia really is incapable of making a completely bad film and there are just enough touches to make it tolerable if not memorable .
410042	2567136	171343	6.0	Early Autumn	Definitely not for the short attention-span set . This takes its own sweet time to get anywhere and even then you're not quite sure where it's taken you . It kicks off with a long opening sequence resembling nothing more than a pre-war black and white documentary on traditional wine-growing in Georgia and I may as well state my ignorance up front , I didn't even know that Georgia HAD a wine-growing industry but I'm guessing they don't export too much of it . The screening I attended was introduced by the director who advised us not to read the subtitles and , to a great extent , the film can be followed just by watching it . If it has a central character it is Nico , a teenager who gets a job in a wine-collective ( if that's the correct term ) and subsequently decides that one of the new barrels is undrinkable and ensures it will not be bottled by adding gelatin to the barrel . That's about it apart from a slight sub-plot involving a possessive bully and two giggling girls . I'm glad I saw it but I'm not sure I'd want to sit through it again .
410201	2567136	382765	6.0	A Town Called Malice	This is going to cause some bemusement in the Multiplexs inasmuch as it takes it time saying ultimately very little . World-class actress Laura Linney is outstanding as apparently the only person in Jindabyne with anything approaching a moral compass . Gabriel Byrne as her husband and leading Man Without A Conscience is fine at portraying macho bafflement that his actions - he is the one who ' finds ' the body and subsequently tethers it in the water so that he and his buddies can continue fishing and bonding in relative peace - but not quite so successful at hiding a sensitivity that would have prevented his character behaving callously . There's a nice touch in the killer's number plate ( and the director makes sure we get a good look at it ) which begins with the letters AB and lead us to think - as the killer clearly does - ' abbo ' short for his aboriginal victim . On the other hand Jindabyne comes across as something from Yoknapathawta County with Flem Snopes progeny speaking Strine instead of Delta and have we EVER seen so many dysfunctional families in such a small town before . After Lantana Ray Lawrence's new film DOES disappoint but only a little and should really be seen by discriminating viewers .
410091	2567136	95250	6.0	Don't Luc Now . . .	. . . but it's been done before . On the other hand what hasn't but so many posters seem to regard this as totally original that I have to question whether they are real movie buffs or maybe just like underwater stuff . It's not necessary to have actually SEEN every film ever made or even say a Tenth of all the films ever made but serious movie buffs should be AWARE of what has gone before and I refuse to believe that I'm the only person who has ever HEARD of if not actually seen ' Beyond The 12-Mile Reef , a Fox entry from the early fifties with a fairly starry cast-list for the time ; Robert Wagner , then just establishing himself as a handsome hunk if not actually an actor , played a young Greek conch fisherman who spent his days diving with his father , Gilbert Roland , for conches ( sponges ) and as the supply dwindled obliged to move into the much deeper waters of the title . Richard Boone was on hand as a rival fisherman with a comely daughter , Tery Moore , engaged to Peter Graves ( shortly before he appeared as the German ' plant ' in Billy Wilder's Stalag 17 ) until Wagner comes on the scene . As if that line up weren't enough J . Carroll Naish was along for the ride to steal every scene that wasn't nailed down and let's not forget Wagner's Greek mother who does a lot of cooking . Luc Besson has taken this plot and refined it slightly ; it's still about diving to great depths and there's still an attractive woman to complicate things although Besson is not completely without shame and dispenses with the rivalry between divers Jean Reno and Jean-Marc Barr almost as soon as it manifests itself . It has a tendency to be episodic rather than continuous and there are too many non sequiters - we have , for example , to imagine how Barr got to Peru and from there to Taormina and not worry too much about stealing a dolphin and releasing it into the sea . It's always good to see Jean Reno and it was interesting to catch Sergio Castellitto in an early performance but that's about it .
409111	2567136	373450	6.0	In The Immortal Words Of Pontius Pilate . . .	. . . what is truth ? We could add Does It Matter / Who Cares etc . This is a reasonably entertaining film but further than that I'm not prepared to go . I'll usually go to ANY movie about showbiz however peripheral but classics like Mank's All About Eve and Wilder's Sunset Boulevard have made it tough for the competition . In this case I detected absolutely no charisma in either Colin Firth or Kevin Bacon , who are both , I hasten to add , fine actors and they act WELL here but it's impossible to believe that they were , even for one moment , superstars in the mold of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis who they are clearly modeled on . With the exception of Jerry Colonna , who was not part of a double act , and Oliver Hardy , who was not playing a charmer , I can't think of one partner in a well-known double act who has worn a moustache as Colin Firth does here and he completely misses the easy charm of Dean Martin . Of course they are not MEANT to be Martin and Lewis otherwise the death of the girl would attract serious litigation but there WAS a girl who died after a ' party ' with another well-known comedian , Roscoe ' Fatty ' Arbuckle , several years before the events depicted here ; of such melanges are stories / screenplays woven . Egoyan keeps the action interesting by weaving back and forth and playing with time and the ultimate ' truth ' if something of a cop out is at least semi plausible . Pleasant ? Yes . Entertaining ? Yes . Significant ? You've got to be kidding .
409230	2567136	47370	6.0	Key Largo	On paper this had the makings of a winner ; co-scripted ( with her ex - Collier Young ) by that most intelligent of actresses ( who was also no slouch as a director ) Ida Lupino , directed by Don Seigel at just about the time he started making a noise ( Riot In Cell Block 11 was made back-to-back with this entry ) , with major acting credits split equally between Lupino , Dean Jagger , Dorothy Malone , Howard Duff and Steve Cochran , all well known at the time , it should have turned out far better than it did . Watching it today the pace appears to be well off and coupled to that is that uneasy feeling that some of the cast are playing in different films . Lupino always delivers and trivia buffs will note that she had already played a pianist-singer in Jean Negulesco's 1948 entry Roadhouse and in both movies her character was named Lily ( or , in this case , Lili ) Stevens and Marlowe respectively and as an actress she would offer one of her greatest portrayals as Marion , the wife of actor Charley Castle in Clifford Odets ' The Big Knife two years later . On the other hand even cast as a domesticated wife Dorothy Malone can't help vamping as if still auditioning for the Lupino femme fatale role . It's watchable certainly but certainly no more .
410140	2567136	46714	6.0	The Way To The Stairs	In a perfect world of course and as it applies to film there would be a definitive film in one genre and no one would bother trying to equal it and leave well enough alone . Alas , we don't live in a perfect world though we DO have a definitive Air Force British movie covering the second world war in the shape of Rattigan's The Way To The Stars which focused more on life on the ground than in the air . Angels One Five stupidly attempts to do the same thing and falls light years short making it more a way to the stairs - even the naughty stair - than to the stars . On the other hand there may well be those who remain ignorant of Rattigan's masterpiece and they will find this highly acceptable despite John Gregson's spot-on impression of a silver birch . Shot in the early fifties there was still enough of England left to capture on film and it must be films like this that inspired the New Left to obliterate it , sadly , where Hitler failed , Tony Blair virtually succeeded .
409295	2567136	49456	6.0	Touch And Gauguin	I find I can't relate to the comments I've just been reading on this movie . I have to say that I've just watched it for the first time some fifty one years after it was initially released and that may be a factor . The one thing you can usually count on with Minnelli is a movie bathed , if not drenched in colour and I would have supposed that the subject matter here cried out for just such a director but unless the print I saw was suspect I found the colours verging on the drab rather than the sensuous with lots of grays where one expected bright yellows , similarly the acting of both Douglas and Quinn seemed subdued rather than visceral , in short the film was ( to me ) a disappointment .
408779	2567136	31334	6.0	Doesn't Deserve To Get The Bird	This is exactly the kind of Boy's Own Paper yarn that I'd walk a mile for a camel to take me away from . On the other hand most Boy's Own Paper yarns don't come complete with Ralph Richardson , an actor who automatically enhances any film he cares to grace with his presence . The English scenes are reasonably lavish , the actors portraying the English upper crust are reasonably wooden and June Duprez is beyond inadequate as the nearest thing to a leading lady . John Clemensts as Harry Faversham , coward turned hero is barely up to it and there are lots of extras playing Fuzzy Wuzzies which complement the fuzzy wuzziness of the whole enchilada . See it for Richardson .
409183	2567136	51378	6.0	When Irish Eyes Are Smiling . . .	. . . it's twelve to seven the eyes in question belong to William Irish , aka Cornell Woollrich and the smile will be ironic because this plot is PURE Woollrich / Irish - in fact Moreau starred in a GENUINE Irish plot some years later , The Bride Wore Black . If you like serendipitous coincidence then this will be right down your rue ; Julien and his bosse's wife are an item and conspire to kill said boss and make it look like suicide . The plot goes like clockwork til , having left the building for the weekend Julien ( Maurice Ronet ) gets in his car , starts the engine then spots a glaring clue he omitted to take care of . Leaving the engine running he goes back to the building , gets in the elevator only to have it switched off by the janitor , who's leaving for the weekend . Trapped in the elevator Julien has no idea that a tearaway , Louis , and his girlfriend , Veronique , have ' borrowed ' the car and will subsequently kill two German tourists in a motel , using Julien's gun - conveniently left in the car . Meanwhile Moreau spots Veronique in the car but , not seeing Louis behind the wheel , assumes Julien is stepping out on her . When the janitor turns on the elevator so that the police can search Julien's office , he seizes his chance to escape not realizing he is wanted for a double murder of which he is completely innocent . Nice plot , nice atmos , nice score a la Miles Davis . Improbable , okay , but entertaining with it .
408793	2567136	45591	7.0	Past The Dead Wood Stage	This must have been like a breath of fresh air in 1953 . There hadn't been an ' Original ' screen musical for several years , instead there had been several ' bio-pics ' of composers / performers and Day had even featured in one ( I'll See You In My Dreams , the biopic of lyricist Gus Kahn ) herself . So this Annie Get Your Gun-lite ( a love-hate relationship between two sharp-shooters , ' challenge ' duet ( Anything You Can Do , I Can Do Without You ) pushed all the right buttons . If you're prepared to suspend disbelief and respond to a fine score then you'll enjoy this one . Allyn McLerie shows what she might have been had things turned out differently and her Broadway background showed - she was , for a time , married to Adolph Green , and appeared in several shows including Where's Charley - and makes a fine second lead . Howard Keel points up the links to Annie Get Your Gun and apart from bursting into Higher Than A Hawk for no discernible reason , proves a decent enough foil for Day . Sammy Fain was an excellent composer though the Oscar-winning Secret Love is much inferior to his earlier I'll Be Seeing You , from a Revue , Right This Way , in 1938 . Overall all this is a pleasant romp .
409461	2567136	45586	7.0	Back Home In Indiana	Nobody ever accused Hollywood of being slow to cash in on success and just as Jolson Sings Again followed The Jolson Story as night follows day so On Moonlight Bay was succeeded by By The Light Of The Silvery Moon a couple of years later . It's more or less the mixture as before except that this time they get much more mileage out of Billy Gray misinterpreting an innocent note . On one hand these two movies are a great antidote to the in-yer-face and let-it-all-hang-out fodder of today's Hollywood whilst on the other there's a double helping of saccharine on offer but then again at least it isn't sugar . if you're feeling nostalgic this one pushes the right buttons .
408897	2567136	369053	7.0	Into The Woods	Hats off to Julian Fellowes for reminding the cognoscenti what a fine novelist Nigel Balchin was and for arguably introducing him to a new audience , although this is unlikely to attract the popcorn crowd . Balchin was one of three English writers all active in the thirties , forties , and fifties who all had ' day ' jobs - Nevil Shute was an engineer in the aircraft industry , Norman Collins was a publisher turned television executive and Balchin was a scientist - and were adapted successfully for the screen - Collins with ' London Belongs To Me ' , Shute with ' A Town Like Alice ' , ' No Highway ' and ' On The Beach ' and Balchin - who also wrote the occasional screenplay himself - with ' The Small Back Room ' and ' Mine Own Exectutioner ' - and are largely forgotten today . Fellowes has seen fit to ' update ' Balchin's ' A Way Through The Wood ' - which was also adapted for the stage some forty years ago - which doesn't quite come off if one knows and admires the original which is ironic given that Balchin kept ' up to date ' with innovations - The Small Back Room , for instance , featured German bombs concealed in thermos flasks - yet it seems grossly intrusive to pepper this screenplay with computers , laptops , Eurostar , etc . It may be this uneasiness that drew my critical faculties to other incongruities like the cleaning lady who lives in a splendid detached house that would probably fetch something like three quarters of a million in this day and age , or Emily Watson preparing an elaborate meal that would cater a small dinner party for just two people . Further , the chemistry or lack of it appears all wrong ; there's nothing about either Tom Wilkinson or Rupert Everett that would attract any woman though to be fair Watson herself is hardly Miss Sex Appeal 2005 . With all this out of the way it remains a fairly decent film and one that should find its audience ; anyone capable of holding two thoughts simultaneously . At its core is how we define ' love ' and what we will do to find it and / or retain it . Having presumably known what she was doing when she married Manning ( Wilkinson ) , a dry , undemonstrative man and unimaginative lover , Watson should have been prepared to stick it out and not play moth to verett's flame but once she did so , not once , but thrice , Manning should have said , fine , enough's enough , the decree absolute is in the post but love , of course , doesn't work like that and THIS is what the film is about . The acting is splendid and Fellowes ' writing and direction not that far behind .
408929	2567136	66249	7.0	Down To Cases	This has been called Billy Wilder's last Great film which seems a little unfair on three of the four - Avanti , The Front Page , Fedora - that followed it although I wouldn't argue that his last film , Buddy , Buddy , was also his worst . No one admires Wilder more than I do but I still find it difficult to work up much of a sweat about this entry . It is , of course , a racing certainty that the missing footage , something like one hour of screen time , would have enhanced my own enjoyment and complemented the things I had no quarrel with , i . e . the period ' feel ' the attention to detail though against this I found it hard to accept Colin Blakely's ' bumbling ' and slightly inept Watson though on the whole Robert Stephens caught the darker facets of Holmes ' psyche admirably . Maybe it was the Boy's Own Paper element of submersibles and midgets to say nothing of Stanley Holloway's wayward Scottish accent clearly perfected at the Dick Van Dyke School Of Regional Accents that did for me . On the other hand no film in which Wilder had a hand however small is unrewarding ( even Buddy , Buddy ) and this is no exception .
409516	2567136	160513	7.0	( Bad ) Dream Weaver	Had this been made in the old days it would have been firmly labelled a ' woman's picture ' and possibly rated as a one , two , three or even four handkerchief weepie . Although someone old-fashioned in content it does benefit from excellent performances from the thee leads and whilst it's true that Sigourney Weaver gets the lion's share both emotion and emoting-wise both David Staithairn and Julianne Moore both support and match her . The story has married couple Stathairn and Weaver opting out of urban life for the joys of the country , which tend to sour a little when Weaver , working as a nurse in a local school , ruffles a few feathers and winds up in the slammer on a morals charge . This would be bad enough at any time but it comes right on top of Moore's daughter drowning whilst in the care of Weaver . You can take it from there yourselves so suffice it to say it's a fine example of the genre .
408791	2567136	83925	7.0	Serrault + Chapeau = De Trop	If this movie were ever shown in English-speaking countries they could do worse that call it Tailor and Cutter , which pretty much sums up the plot ; Charles Aznavour is a tailor in a French provincial town and the only citizen to suspect hatter Michel Serrault of serial murder . As usual Chabrol is good at depicting French Provincial life though it could be argued that he lets him camera wander down the same narrow , cobblestoned street once too often . Despite his major billing Aznavour is restricted to a Supporting role at best and spends ninety five per cent of his screen time openly ' shadowing ' Serrault and being taunted for his pains . Even if you don't know the storyline going in it soon becomes apparent that 1 ) Serrault has a secret and 2 ) Aznavour has a pretty shrewd idea what it is so that what pleasure there is to be had comes from observing the cat and mouse game which Serrault enjoys as much as killing and it is significant that when Aznavour falls ill and dies Serrault loses his own zest for life and throws in the towel . Certainly worth watching but not vintage Chabrol .
409800	2567136	54698	7.0	The Unhappy Hooker	This film calls to mind the celebrated Brooks Atkinson quote in his review of the first production of Pal Joey in 1940 . Acknowledging that the Rodgers and Hart score was up to snuff likewise the acting he then drew attention to the fact that the entire cast were low-lifes , heels and / or worse and asked ' Can you draw sweet water from a foul well ? ' It's a question we may well ask of this movie ; ostensibly it's a sumptuous , sophisticated , feel-good chick flick but the only problem is that he's a gigolo and she's a hooker-lite . Truman Capote wrote a novella that was close to Christopher Isherwood's Goodbye To Berlin in which a gay writer ( Isherwood / Capote ) ' observed ' a hooker ( Sally Bowles / Holly Golightly ) albeit ' quirky ' and / or ' fascinating ' but still a hooker . George Axelrod , working presumably with helmer Blake Edwards has fashioned a screenplay in which a gay ' observer ' has become a heterosexual gigolo and the hooker is actually WORSE than a real hooker because she willingly and knowingly accepts cash from men on the tacit understanding that sex is on the menu and then skips out on them via the powder room - having first extracted another fifty dollars for the alleged purpose . At least the gigolo ( George Peppard , aka Mr Mahogany ) delivers though even here one could argue that Patricia Neal isn't exactly chopped liver - in reality he'd be humping someone who looked like Marjorie Main - whilst the hooker remains a hooker who isn't . It's obvious that a lot of viewers have chosen to ignore the sordidness and enjoy the surface which is , of course , glamor personified . It IS enjoyable , especially when Hepburn is on the screen and if Peppard IS wooden , so what . They wear elegant clothes , mix with elegant people and inhabit a Manhattan with nary a mugger or bag lady to its name . If it's escapism you want look no further and DON'T look beneath the surface veneer .
409738	2567136	32410	7.0	Down Argentine Why ? . . .	. . . when it could just as soon have been called Down Upper Sandusky Way in terms of plot . What it was , of course , was at once a morale booster and a nod to its South American neighbours from the movie capital of North America if not the world . This was Carmen Miranda's first appearance outside the Latin American market and as such she has absolutely nothing to do with anything even faintly resembling a plot . C . Aubrey Smith lookalike Henry Stephenson is about as convincing as a South American horse-breeder as Michael Jackson would be as a gaucho but if things like this bother you then you're missing the point . Charlotte Greenwood weighs in with her trademark high kicks and there are more of the same from the Nicholas Brothers ; leads Don Ameche and Betty Grable exhibit as much chemistry as an empty petri dish but score individually whilst Mack Gordon and Harry Warren turned in a score that was just about up to snuff . All in all a pleasant enough crowd-pleaser .
409433	2567136	765142	7.0	What's Up , Doc ?	It's difficult to know what Benoit Cohen had in mind here . Mid-life crises are not exactly new but they usually involve dressing younger , buying a sports car and generally making a fool of oneself ; seldom does someone in the grip of MLC abandon a highly successful career to become a full-time rock musician as in this case . Theoretically if one DID abandon a job as a Senior Consultant in a large hospital to pursue a career in rock one would , by definition , need to find enough people undergoing crises of their own and have them be 1 ) sufficiently talented and 2 ) equally prepared to abandon careers in which they have established themselves ; in short , unrealistic . Nevertheless that's what our intrepid hero does , to the chagrin of both his father , who suffers a heart attack on hearing the news , and his Avocat wife . Cohen seems to want it both ways ; on one hand the Doctor succeeds in living his dream , on the other it all ends in tears . It's certainly interesting and pleasant to watch but little more .
409935	2567136	104507	7.0	Istanbul Was Constantinople . . .	. . . and there's a lot of that about because Vietnam WAS Indochina at the time this movie deals with which is primarily the 1930s . Eliane Devries ( Catherine Deneuve ) has both a daughter and a son yet has never given birth which is maybe a metaphor for France ' adopting ' Indochina . Like Heart Of Darkness the film employs a frame-narrator in the shape of Deneuve who begins by telling her story to Camille ( Linh Dan Pham ) whose parents have just been killed and because they were Eliane's best friends she has adopted Camille - who comes with a dowry of her parent's land which swell the size of Eliane's rubber plantation - and both raises and loves her as her own . Devries is a chic Frenchwoman who , for reasons never satisfactorily explained , has forsaken the chic , culture and civilisation of France for a superficially beautiful yet ultimately harsh land that's not unlike the ante-bellum South without the Mississippi . When a young naval officer , Jean-Baptiste ( Vincent Perez ) appears on the scene the inevitable happens and May and December have their mayfly moment . Jean-Baptiste was , of course , the name of the mime artist in Les Enfants du Paradis and is well chosen given that Perez , who has all the charisma of the Black Hole of Calcutta on a bad day , might just as well be miming for all the animation he brings to his lines . Equally inevitably Camille falls in love with him and when Deneuve has him transferred to a remote outpost Camille follows him and contrives to kill one of his colleagues putting them both on the run . All this is played out against the political unrest that is always a by-product of colonialism . In turn Camille has a child by Jean-Baptiste ; he is killed , she becomes something of a Vietnamese La Passionara and Deneuve winds up holding the baby and it is he , now a grown man , to whom Deneuve is narrating the story in 1954 as Indochina became Vietnam . Weighing in at two and a half hours it requires stamina but in addition to Deneuve both Jean Yanne and Dominique Blanc are on hand and against all the odds it does keep you watching .
409630	2567136	32234	7.0	Field ( s ) Of Drams	I've just had the chance to check this out again after several years . Time was I found Fields easy to take especially when he managed to slip some manual dexterity - at which he excelled - into his movies . Time , I fear , hasn't been kind to our boy though anyone who likes slapstick - and there are thousands , how else to account for the popularity of Chaplin - will enjoy this . It's well documented that Bill was fond of a dram or seven and I've heard serious debate on whether what appeared to be comic timing was actually the DTs and that aspect - the not-quite double take as he suddenly twitches as if beset by a swarm of invisible bees - is in evidence here in this self-penned tale of the head of a dysfunctional family who lucks into a job as security guard at a local bank . In the nothing-new-under-the-sun department scriptwriter Fields created a character named Egbert Souse pronounced SoosAY a good couple of decades before someone else created Hyacinth Bucket pronounced Bookay . Fields buffs will love this one .
410185	2567136	47597	7.0	That Towering Feeling	One Hundred Ways To Lose Your Lover ? Forget the Black Widow and the Praying Mantis they're SO Paleolithic , take a leaf out of Marguerite's book , boff them , have them thrown from the eponymous tower into the Seine with an archer standing by to place an arrow where it will do the most good when they surface . Alexander Dumas was something of a Graham Greene in the number of times his work has been adapted for the screen and / or theatre and television - the figure is now approaching 200 with no end in sight - and Gance himself had a crack at La Reine Margot but alas , Daniele Thompson wasn't around to whip up a screenplay . As someone familiar with the Rue de Nesle , where it's small theatre often stages the works of Agnes Jaoui and Jean-Pierre Bacri , I had an extra interest in this late work from Gance and I have to say that it fascinates on several levels notably the use of colour which the French cinema had not explored in great detail at the time ; if it isn't just a faded print I saw then Gance's use of muted pastels where others would have used bold oils is to be applauded as his eye for filling the frame with detail and achieving a fine blend of gentry and peasant . The principal setting would not be out of place in a Robin Hood movie and indeed with all the lingering shots of stone staircases punctuated by burning torches mounted on wall brackets one half expects to come upon Errol Flynn striking sparks of Basil Rathbone . The plot itself is a heady brew of over-heated intrigue , passion , lust , betrayal which is so much poppycock but Michel Bouquet throws in a nice cameo as a slightly ditsy Louis X and it's interesting to know that not only did the French invent tennis but squash as well . One for connoisseurs .
410137	2567136	36160	7.0	This Contented Rosie	At the time this must have been easy to file as painless propaganda ; Launder and Gilliat start off as if attempting to emulate Noel Coward's classic This Happy Breed , we are introduced to a cut-rate Gibbons family and in particular two daughters , one a flighty Queenie clone this time called Elsie ( Joy Shelton ) and a more grounded Phyllis , now called Cecilia ( Patricia Roc ) but very soon and perhaps wisely the team realise that even the two of them are light years short of one Noel Coward so they veer off into Rosie The Riveter mode and give us a picture of Women At War which is not unpalatable by any means . There are two romances both slightly improbable , Patricia Roc snags a hopelessly inept Gordon Jackson whilst second female lead Ann Crawford winds up with Eric Portman . Seen today for the first time it failed to bore or embarrass though the England depicted is on the far side of the galaxy compared to what Blair has made of it .
409119	2567136	179096	7.0	Ivory Coasting	Richard Pottier , all but forgotten today , was as fine a journeyman as any director working in French cinema - he was actually born in what used to be known as the Austro-Hungarian empire in the middle of the twentieth century ; he worked with Prevert , Fernandel and directed no less than five movies for Continental during the occupation and was at home in most types of film making him something of a small-scale Michael Curtiz . This hugely enjoyable entry would hardly claim to be original - two film flam men team up with a femme fatale to take a rich pigeon and forget their original goal when they realise he possesses a ' treasure ' map which , if interpreted correctly will leave them up to their asses in ivory - but , as is so often the case , it's all in the wrists and when the wrists are on hands belonging to Isa Miranda we're in relatively safe hands .
409216	2567136	49177	7.0	The Star Who Came In From The Cold	Several posters have quoted Renoir voicing his desire to make a film showing Ingrid Bergman smiling to camera . The short answer is wouldn't we all whilst the harsh reality is that only a select few got to do so . At this stage of her career Bergman couldn't get arrested ; in 1949 she left Hollywood to make a picture in Europe , fell for director Roberto Rossellini and never looked forward . After five turkeys in Italy she was probably ready to open a vein but within the year , after making this for Renoir , she was back where she belonged and with an Oscar to boot for Anastasia . This is one of three movies that Renoir made in color around this time and on balance it's better than The Golden Coach , which isn't hard , and about even with French Can Can . Renoir probably figured that with so much going for her Bergman could get away with a couple of wooden leading men and Renoir picked two doozys in Jean Marais and Mel Ferrer , solid mahogany in both cases . The plot is actually based on a real incident in French history but Renoir is content to give it a once-over-lightly and concentrate on replicating the paintings of his father in set up after set up . In its pastel colors it resembles another film of the period Les Grandes Manouvres which is no bad thing . All in all it remains a pleasant trifle showcasing a beautiful and charismatic actress .
410263	2567136	877621	8.0	Yentl Come Home	Don't see this if there are no subtitles and your French is sketchy at best to non-existent otherwise you'll drive yourself crazy trying to figure out if it's a fantasy or what . It's 1917 and the war is in full spate . In the North East of the country Sylvie Testud gets a Dear Jean letter and instead of murmuring philosophically , c'est la vie , c'est l'amour she chops off her hair , finds a pair of pants and lights out for the front to ask the guy who done her wrong just what he thinks he's doing . Before long she runs across a raggle-taggle unit led by Pascal Greggory , tags along and winds up with a uniform - they just happened to have a spare in her size as you do - but no gun and becomes part of the group . They march , and march and march some more but strangely enough in the middle of a major war they never run into any actual fighting though they do hear gunfire on one occasion . Even more bizarrely they keep breaking into song , complete with an quintet / sextet of soldier / musicians at a time when one would have thought discretion would dictate silence . Eventually Testud's errant mate shows up , they put in some sack time - in pajamas yet , presumably from the same quartermaster's stores that laid the uniform on Testud - and the group moves on leaving them to it . It's actually a beautifully shot and engrossing film a sort of hybrid of Yentl , Victor Victoria and A Very Long Engagement . Sylvie Testud is clearly brave enough to play a role in which she is seen as androgynous whereas she is actually a very lovely and very feminine actress and she works well with Greggory although virtually all the actors turn in fine performances . Not really multiplex fodder but no worse for that so if there's an Art House near you lobby them to book this .
409748	2567136	160639	8.0	Slaps At Sea	A wonderful time-capsule of a Europe on the brink of war - begun in 1939 and finished after the outbreak of war - and of the great liners at the end of their hey-day before they became troop carriers . The many-stranded plot contrives to pack some very representative actors of French cinema - Gaby Morlay , Jules Berry , Michel Simon , Claude Dauphin - on board the Normandie , one of the iconic liners - and pack them off to New York allowing plenty of time for misunderstandings , star-crossings and star-crossed lovers before more or less resolving the loose ends in and around the French Pavilion in New York . Light , buoyant , charming , nostalgic . Who could ask for anything more .
409891	2567136	202656	8.0	That's Life	Thanks to the generosity of the guys in France and Norway I now own copies of arguably the three most significant films of writer-director Albert Valentin . Chronologically these are L'Entraineuse , Marie-Martine and this one . Unfortunately Valentin's self-esteem was weaker than his talent and when films of this caliber met with critical mauling and public indifference he threw in the towel and played out his career writing pot-boilers in Italy and Germany . His CV is modest compared to some ; 35 writer and 13 director credits ( I actually listed some of these but the IMDb computer will not allow me to post this comment until I delete them ; I have encountered this problem before and written to the helpdesk and thought it was fixed but the computer still insists I have made ' many spelling ' mistakes ) . It's doubtful whether many filmmakers in 1944 were exploring a story from two opposing viewpoints ( indeed it is still comparatively rare enough to draw special mention when it was employed a couple of years ago in ' A la folle . . . pas du tout ' ) but by then Valentin was an old hand having made Marie-Martine in a highly complex time-frame . The concept of a member of the demi-monde attempting to become upwardly mobile was one that had informed Valentin's ' L'Entraineuse ' with the difference that whilst in the former Michele Morgan merely worked in a nightclub in this one Albert Prejean actually owns Le Vie de plaisir and whilst Morgan aspired only to friendship with a higher caste Prejean actually marries into the Aristocracy and both , needless to say , live to regret it . Somewhat incredibly there is only one comment on this delightful film and that poster has mentioned most of what I would have said so that I can do little but endorse that opinion . I did find especially interesting the Establishing scene in the nightclub where the chorines emerge from the bell of a huge saxophone perhaps an unconscious comment on the women and song ( the wine being in evidence on the tables ) aspect of wine , women and song . From then we are introduced to the denizens of this world , one of the few milieus in which High and Low society can meet freely . In a magnificent stroke the opposing viewpoints are put forward by the Prosecution and Defense in a divorce case involving Prejean and his Aristocratic wife - as each lawyer addresses the Court so we flashback for a His and Hers view of the courtship and marriage . In the midst of this is a somewhat surrealistic scene where a Bishop in full regalia , complete with entourage and extensive religious paraphernalia solemnly blesses a pack of hounds about to engage in a hunt . Indeed bloodsport plays a large part in the family into which Prejean has married and Spaak is on top form as he has Prejean toss a wry comment after his wife as she leaves for a shoot ' tell the pigeons I'm with them ' . With these two scenes - the same Bishop who blessed the hunt will not intercede on behalf of the young aristocrat who has impregnated a girl and wishes to marry her but cannot go against the family wishes - Spaak and Valentin state clearly their stance on the rules of behavior that obtained at the time . In short this is a minor gem and I hope that others will seek it out and be moved to write about it .
409556	2567136	39420	8.0	Ghost-Writers In The Sky	It's a wonderful conceit - though no one seems to have noticed it - to have a bona fide ghost dictate a book to a bona fide mortal who then publishes it under her own name and cleans up , giving at once a new meaning to and putting spin on the term ghost-writer , a term applicable mainly to volumes of memoirs / autobiography as in this case when the ghost in question , a sea captain ( Rex Harrison ) dictates a volume recounting his experiences at sea to the woman who's come to live in his old house ( Gene Tierney ) . Mank had worked with Tierney in Dragonwyck and would work with Harrison again in Escape , Cleopatra and The Honeypot none of which were top-drawer Mankiewicz . You could argue that someone like Edmund Gwen would have been more suited to a crusty yet lovable sea captain but Gwen couldn't cut the romantic angle so Harrison was possibly the better choice though he failed to convince me on either count . On the other hand I've always been slightly bemused by the claims that Harrison was one of the best light comedians around . On the other hand there is no doubt that Gene Tierney did possess a slightly ethereal quality which made her ideal for the ' ghostly ' Laura . George Sanders merely phones in his standard suave cad and there must be thousands of slush-pile victims staring in amazement at the way Tierney is able as a complete unknown to march into a publishers with her ( technically not even HER ) first book in her hand , obtain an audience with a publisher who reads it whilst she waits and agrees to publish it on the spot , that's how we KNOW this is a fantasy .
408846	2567136	39215	8.0	Ticket To Ride	There's a school of thought that makes a case for Pyshka as the finest adaptation of Guy de Maupassant's short story Boule de Suif . Directed by Mikhail Romm and starring Galina Sergeyava this was also the last silent film produced in Russia but I'd have to ask another Galina , a valued friend , for more information on this version . Another friend , dbdmonteuil is slightly mistaken when he says that Dudley Nichols used Boule de Suif as a basis for Stagecoach . Nichols adapted a short story , Stage To Lordsburg , by Douglas Haycox , a well-known Western novelist so it is Haycox who may have been inspired by Boule de Suif . What matters ultimately , of course , is what kind of fist Christian Jacque and Micheline Presle made of it and the answer is a pretty damn good one . Jacque had a penchant for period films - his Fanfan La Tulipe - remains a benchmark in French cinema and he exhibits a sure touch with his material . For good measure another Maupassant story , Mademoiselle Fifi , is thrown into the mix and blends in perfectly and seamlessly ; the Hollywood Bomber Crew are all out of the right bottle with stalwarts such as Gabrielle Fontan ( Porte de Lilas , Les Portes de la nuit , etc ) lending sterling support but ultimately it is Presle's movie and she takes it with both hands and runs with it . A minor gem .
410258	2567136	47956	8.0	Ground Forces	For a film about the armed forces with virtually no action , no love interest and over half its running time set in a court room this is strangely effective . Prior to Jack Lemmon's emergence on the scene in the early 50s no one did ' decency ' as well as Jimmy Stewart and Gary Cooper and that being the case Cooper could have phoned this one in had he put his mind to it . Although meaningless liberties have been taken with this true story - what possible difference , for example , could it have made to acknowledge that Mitchell was married rather than imply bachelor status - it still grips in an understated way . Essentially Mitchell distinguished himself as a pilot in the First World War but grew appalled at the indifference if not bias in favour of the Army and Navy in peacetime - there was , in fact , no Air Force - and having exhausted every avenue in an attempt to address this problem he called a press conference and accused the General Staff of incompetence . His purpose , of course , was to get the army to court martial him and use this as a forum to sue for recognition and the formation of a third armed force . For his pains he died in virtual obscurity prior to the second World War he had foreseen . Cooper is solid as the dedicated army man , Rod Steiger showboats in the flashiest role in the film as Prosecuting Attorney and the support is largely out of the right bottle . On the low-key side for an Otto Preminger film but none the worse for that .
409450	2567136	47880	8.0	Cliffhanger	Cliff Odets was one of the finest American playwrights of the 20th century and several of his plays have been adapted for the screen with varying results . This is one of the best . Odets made his name with the Group Theatre in the mid thirties where one of the actors was Jules Garfinckle . Hollywood knocked that out of him and he became John Garfield , in many ways the acting personification of Odets writing , raw , virile , coiled spring contained energy . So it was fitting that when Odets wrote a new play in 1949 Garfield played the lead on Broadway . Alas , I didn't see it but I can imagine how writer and actor combined perfectly . When Robert Aldrich came to make the film he tapped Jack Palance - an actor he worked with in back-to-back productions , this one and ' Attack ' - for the Garfield role , a good choice as it's difficult to think of another actor of the time , with the possible exception of Charles Bronson who was still relatively unknown , who could bring the energy and self-disgust to the part of the stage actor who'd ' sold out ' to Hollywood ( for actor read writer , Odets himself deserted Broadway for Hollywood and lived to regret it ) and can't walk away without paying the price in scandal . Aldrich surrounded Palance with an almost perfect cast . Ida Lupino was seldom better as Marion , the wife in love with her husband's integrity as much as with the man himself , Wendell Corey , never much more than a Johnny-One-Note actor lucked into a part - press agent Smiley Coy - that called for that very one note in his repertoire , Jean Hagan and Shelley Winters handled the Hollywood ' tramps ' as well as any of their contemporaries would have done and Rod Steiger was nothing if not memorable as Stanley Shriner Hoff an amalgam of any movie moguls you care to think of from Harry Cohn to Louis B . Mayer . It's a great script laced with highly quotable lines and full of that Odets pizzaz .
408874	2567136	100747	8.0	Anti Everything	Looking rather similar to Ruth Gordon Tsilla Chelton who takes the eponymous role here gives us a Master Class in Mischief if stopping short of downright evil . She is an amalgam of every irascible curmudgeon you've ever met and wished you hadn't and although it's difficult to discern a secondary meaning other than a Case History of the worst aspects of old age this is a film to be enjoyed as one enjoys a pile-up in a motor race safe in the knowledge that we don't indulge in Formula 1 so will never experience those thrills other than vicariously but most of us , on the other hand , will grow old and God forbid we run across a Tatie Danielle of our own . It's also good to see Karin Viard and Isabelle Nanty in early appearances displaying the promise we have now seen fulfilled . One to see again .
408728	2567136	116206	8.0	Family Matters ( So They Say )	Until someone else posts a comment this one is going to tip the balance in favor of Tonie Marshall's minor gem . I accept the right of the first poster to be negative and it is possible that the film touched a nerve and / or he / she saw it on a bad day . Whatever this IS a great black comedy , trust me , I'm a doctor . It may well have been the ending in which Marshall has the siblings dancing on their father's coffin in the cemetery that influenced Daniele Thompson to OPEN her own dysfunctional family entry , La Buche , in a cemetery , though Thompson confined the black humor to the verbal kind . We begin with a great premise . Jean Yanne , who distributes his seed liberally and indiscriminately , finds himself in court facing a count of Murder One . Four of his siblings who have never met him or each other read about the case , turn up in court and realize their connection . When the siblings in question are Anemone , Nathalie Baye , Francois Cluzet and American Molly Ringwald ( presumably to illustrate how FAR Yanne spread his seed ) we can rest easy knowing that Class is Alive and Well in the Acting Department . After the initial meeting / realization it's just a case of inhibitions being removed and catalysts doing their work . In his orneriness Yanne wants to leave his loot to yet a fifth sibling from SOUTH America yet but , having seen him off , the quartet proceed to induce a heart attack in Yanne by describing how they KILLED their half-brother and this leads to the climactic scene in the cemetery when , in an effort to get a quart into a pint pot ( the grave is not quite large enough to accept the coffin , you really had to be there ) the quartet mount the coffin and literally kick it into the place where it will do the most good . Slightly brilliant .
409751	2567136	67778	8.0	Too Young To Cut The Mustard ? Pas du tout	Louis Malle thought nothing of mining his childhood / youth for films such as Au Revoir , Les Enfants and in most cases these quasi-autobiographical entries are among his finest work . This is no exception ; set in Dijon , perhaps best known as the centre of the moutard ( mustard ) industry , it features a family very like his own , a protagonist very like himself , constantly ragged by two older brothers , obsessed with Jazz and literature and crucially sharing a hotel room with his mother . Stated as baldly as this it's not going to have a line at the box office but as always it is what Malled does with these basic facts that makes this an outstanding film ; beginning with the period ' feel ' which is spot-on and on to which he grafts some brilliant ensemble acting so that although Benoit Ferreux and Lea Massari carry the burden the weight is distributed equally between the very fine supporting actors . One to own on DVD .
410192	2567136	41259	8.0	Conn . Man	Some of the posters seem less than gruntled because this is neither Mark Twain nor Rodgers and Hart but clearly it doesn't pretend to be either . You'll look a long time to find a greater Rodgers and Hart fan than me but Burke and Van Heusen weren't exactly chopped liver in addition to which they knew Der Bingle inside out and tailored some great songs - But Beautiful , Moonlight Becomes You , It's Always You , The Day After Forever , etc - to fit his highly personal style and here they come up with yet another fine - and unfairly neglected - ballad , Once And For Always , plus a couple of upbeat philosophy-lite entries in If You Stub Your Toe On The Moon and Busy Doing Nothing . The flimsy plot isn't meant to be taken seriously - why else make Merlin a heavy when in most , if not all , of the other versions he is more a friend / mentor to Arthur - so if you start wondering aloud why Sir Lancelot who has been sold to historians as the epitome of chivalry and uprightness metamorphoses into a schoolyard bully you're not going to get much fun out of what is essentially a fun movie . On balance it does what it sets out to do , entertain , so good luck to it .
409184	2567136	60802	8.0	Parallel Lines That Meet	It's almost certain that as an English person with no Czech to speak of I missed a good two thirds of the satire here so it's probably just as well that the one third I DID understand is so good . I missed it first time around so it's even more possible that any satire that was pertinent then no longer obtains but even so we are still left with a delightful fable in which a sleepy small town train station is our old friend the microcosm . Although we do have something of a main character in Milos ( Vaclav Neckar ) the teenage virgin apprentice trainee there is a full complement of support both in and around the station from the stationmaster Max ( Vladimir Valenta ) and his wife ( Libuse Havelkova ) who are active in poultry , train dispatcher Hubicka ( Josef Somr ) the Czech equivalent of a babe magnet and who is ultimately responsible for Milos getting laid , Milos's girlfriend of sorts , Masa ( Jitka Bendova ) who is unable to make Milos a ' man ' and Victoria Freie ( Nada Ubankova ) who succeeds where Masa fails . Although it is set in the middle of World War Two there is a curious lack of wartime ' feeling ' despite the presence of a local Quisling . In passing there is one of the most outre phallic symbols in film history but that's another story . Verdict : A real charmer .
409099	2567136	384177	8.0	Other People's Babies	Once again having seen and enjoyed a fine film I turn to these pages and find it inexplicable that no one has seen fit to offer an opinion . Despite a slew of good reviews ( The French tend to favor a nought to three star system ) , three maximums , six ' very good ' , in four weeks in Paris it's only racked up one hundred thousand admissions and last week was down to six thousand in five salles which means that the ruthless French distributors will yank it any minute now . That's no way to treat Bertrand Tavernier but compared to Claude Lelouch he probably feels he's being feted ; Lelouch's latest , The Human Condition : Part One , Parisiens , has been yanked already after just four weeks , I got there just in time but that's another story . It's amazing what Tavernier has been able to do with a very basic story of a French couple - Jacques Gamblin and Isabelle Carre - attempting to adopt a baby girl in Cambodia . Okay , location shooting helps but frankly Cambodia's not THAT interesting or photogenic whichever way you slice it and it's very much the central performances that sell this one . There's solid support from a few other couples in the same boat but Gamblin are Carre are light years ahead of the pack . Both , of course , have been around a while and both have copped awards , Carre , a Best Actress Cesar for Se Souvenirs des belles choses ( another outstanding film that was let down by the public ) and Gamblin in Tavernier's own recent masterpiece Laissez-Passer , but somehow they've never received the recognition they deserve and it may be that they'll be denied this time around too . For a cynical Westerner like me it's all too easy to believe in the political / governmental corruption that obtains in countries like Cambodia and Tavernier does little to disabuse me , telling it , presumably , like it is . And that's all it is , really , hope seguing to frustration , more hope , more bribes until at last . . . but go and see it , it's worth it , believe me .
408910	2567136	477348	8.0	Where's Charley	Way back in 1973 Don Sigel made Charley Varrick in which Walter Matthau made a reasonable living knocking over small mid-West banks til one day he hit the jackpot and unknowingly targeted the small , nondescript bank used for laundering mob money . After that we were into a chase movie with Joe Don Baker pursuing Matthau on behalf of the mob . Now a new wine turns up in an old bottle ; in No Country For Old Men Josh Brolin stumbles on two million dollars and a half dozen stiffs . He takes the money , natch , and just as natch , Javier Bardem - last seen around these parts in Goya's Ghosts - comes after him and there you have it . This is one of those films that unimaginative critics who can't think of anything new to say refer to as a ' return-to-form ' film , in this case the form is allegedly returning to the freres Coen and who am I to say otherwise . I know I liked Fargo and I know I like this one but as for the Form book your guess is as good as mine .
410105	2567136	70133	8.0	Barnstormers	If all you knew about this prior to watching it was that the title translates as The Burning Barns you might be forgiven for anticipating a touch of the Southern Gothics , especially if you were on nodding terms with Faulkner and Tennessee Williams both of whom have written about barn burning as if it were a minor Art form requiring both skill and finesse and at worst a semi-respectable / legitimate occupation . You would , however , soon be disabused because what we have here is yet another story in a rural setting - in this case the Jura - involving a large family headed by matriarch Simone Signoret who owns a farm named The Burning Barns . The body of a young woman is discovered on land owned by Signoret and serves as a springboard to put the somewhat dysfunctional family under a microscope . Alain Delon arrives to head the investigation and the fun / fascination is watching two generations of French actors teaming up again in the wake of the previous year's success Le Veuve Coudroc . There's little in the way of thriller , mystery element but Signoret and Delon are augmented by the likes of Paul Crachet ( who appeared with Signoret in L'Armee des Ombres ) , a young and almost unrecognizable Bernard Le Coq , Miou-Miou and Signoret's real-life daughter Catherine Allegret . It's very watchable and definitely recommended .
409245	2567136	53125	8.0	Getting There	This has to be one of the better Hitchcock movies despite inconsistencies . I find Hitchcock vastly overrated which is not the same as incompetent ; basically he's a first-rate journeyman with a first-rate press agent but here he wisely cast Cary Grant in the lead and supplied him with a worthy villain in the talented shape of James Mason . Given that pairing you could practically cast Marjorie Main as the love interest and get away with it . For an average man in the street Grant is urbanity personified in the face of real , life-threatening danger and witty with it . It defies credence that someone who'd just been force fed an entire fifth of Bourbon would be able to sit up straight in a car let alone negotiate a winding road in the face of oncoming traffic and if you swallow this then nothing that follows will faze you . Enjoyable , Yes ; Credible , No , but what the hey , it's only a movie , Ingrid .
409414	2567136	39823	8.0	Something To Shout About . . .	. . . but in the accepted meaning of the phrase , meaning something to praise from the rooftops rather than the meaning with which Truffaut invested it , which might better be termed something to rant about , for this is exactly the kind of ' quality ' film or ' film du papa ' that got right up Truffaut's nose and led to his infamous vitriolic attack on traditional film-making . In many ways Clair's film complements Jean Renoir's French Can Can because both were celebrations of a world that had vanished and it is less than coincidence that both film makers had been absent from France for several years and returned to find the France of their youth gone with the wind . Their immediate response was to attempt to recapture it on film and whilst Renoir plumped for the fin-de-siecle Paris of Toulouse Lautrec , Montmartre and the Moulin Rouge Clair opted for the world of the heyday of Silent Film , the 1920s . Not surprisingly the film is replete with exquisite touches , mementos of a lost world and so authentic is the studio-created Paris that time and again it looks and feels like the real thing . Clair has concocted a souffl√© of a plot around what is essentially a valentine to a time gone by and he has taken a dash of Edmund Rostand and Cyrano de Bergerac insofar as Maurice Chevalier's Emile takes under his wing the Jacques of Francois Perrier and schools him in the art of seduction whilst counselling him never to fall in love . This , of course , sets the scene for Emile to do just that when the daughter of a friend turns to him for help . Emile finds Madeleine ( Marcelle Derrien ) irresistible despite her being young enough to be his daughter and though she stops short of loving him in return she does develop a deep affection for him and would be quite happy to marry him until , of course , she meets Jacques . Neither has any idea of the part they play in the life of Emile and what could have been an interesting situation open to several permutations is resolved neatly and speedily by Clair since his interest in the situation is peripheral at best . He does succeed brilliantly in his evocation of a Golden Age and on that level the film is little short of a masterpiece .
410199	2567136	62883	8.0	Sing A Rainbow	Frank Sinatra's film career is fairly easily compartmentalized ; the forties musicals in which he was expected merely to sing and play shy ; a handful of ' serious ' roles in the fifties and sixties in which he revealed what a fine actor he actually was when he put his mind to it and the self-indulgent years in the sixties when he just enjoyed himself on screen with or without the Rat Pack . Gordon Douglas directed Sinatra five times beginning with Young At Heart in 1954 , by far the best of the five inasmuch as it exploited Sinatra's two strengths , Singing and Acting . One of the other four was Robin And The Seven Hoods , in which The Rat Pack enjoyed themselves on screen and two of the other three , Tony Rome and Lady In Cement , allowed Sinatra to enjoy himself on screen without the Rat Pack but sandwiched in between Tony Rome and Lady In Cement was The Detective , arguably Sinatra's last half-decent film ( though feel free to nominate Dirty Dingus Magee or The First Deadly Sin ) . For ninety five per cent of the time Sinatra puts his mind to acting , losing himself in a character and there are only fleeting moments - the look / grin he gives Al Freeman in the opening sequence when Freeman says ' I hear you're the best detective in town - when he reverts to ' being ' Sinatra . Horace McMahon must have felt he was caught in a time-warp , having played the same role , captain of detectives , in William Wyler's Detective Story back in 1951 , but he offers solid support as do Ralph Meeker , Robert Duvall and Jack Klugman . Lee Remick is as good as she always was but Jacqueline Bisset seems ill at ease in a largely colourless role . It was probably outspoken for its time but we look back in irony forty years on as the same corruption Joe Leland was seeking to expose and eliminate is still in business at the same old stand . A lifelong Sinatra fan of both his singing and acting I find this - along with The Manchurian Candidate - one of the most watchable of his 60s movies .
409046	2567136	27951	8.0	A Shot In The Light	As another poster has pointed out neither version of Mayerling is based on the actual events but on those events as distorted through the prism of the novel . Nevertheless both the principals and the situations did exist and Anatole Litvak , Charles Boyer and Danielle Darrieux burn THIS version of the story into our retinas . All three benefited from the success of the film and if success is measured in Hollywood contracts then again all three triumphed . Litvak and Boyer made more out of it than Darrieux who quickly returned to France where she made some great movies with her first husband , Henri Decoin , and subsequently with others . Just eighteen at the time she played the tragic lover she filled the screen with the freshness of youth and the broken promise of dawn . Litvak tips his glove from Frame # 1 which he fills with shadows on a wall at once announcing that this is but a shadow-play and that all of us are insubstantial as shadows in the wider scheme of things . It's true that the Terence Young version had a lovelier Sissi in the shape of Ava Gardner but Young had to make do with Catherine Deneuve whilst Litvak had Darrieux . Enough said .
409380	2567136	43137	8.0	You CAN Get A Man With A Gun	By 1955 , five years after this one was released James Stewart and Anthony Mann had completed another six films together , four of them Westerns . Their rapport was obvious from the outset and what was intended as little more than a Universal progrmmer became both a cult and a classic . Buffs of the period will revel in the fact that the first ten names on the credits were all more than well known - and that's not counting Ray Teal or ' Anthony ' Curtis , later to become Tony . Perhaps ten years later the ' psychological ' western was well entrenched but in 1950 it was rare to throw Ahab into the mix with Cain and Abel , to say nothing of addressing several other issues along the way , and still furnish a conventional western on the surface and full credit to all concerned . One to add to the DVD collection .
409956	2567136	45478	8.0	An Affair To Forget	In case there are any Literalists out there let me begin by saying that my summary merely refers to the fact that nearly everyone concerned wants to forget the Maurizius Affair but for various reasons are unable to do so , what the summary is NOT saying is that this is a forgettable film . Anyone who's read my comments on other Duvivier movies will know that I bow to no one ( not even the extremely generous French guy who tapes French movies unlikely to be shown in the UK from French television and sends them to me ) in my admiration for Duvivier and love of his work . Okay , it's bleak - at least this one is - but so is life , Charlie , and where else could you see quality actors like Charles Vanel , Madeleine Robinson - albeit underused - and Anton ' Tillie ' Walbrook going through their paces . Ultimately this is an affair with no winners only losers and what is lost among other things like respect are illusions , perhaps the most precious gift of all . The shadowy , misty sets are reminiscent of the ' poetic-realism ' school pioneered by the Prevert-Carne team and , of course , none the worse for that . On balance I wouldn't rank this with Duvivier's finest work but it's definitely the best of his second-string and should certainly be seen .
410142	2567136	58331	8.0	Good Golly , Miss Brolly	Everyone with even a minor interest in film has probably seen this at one time or another if only on television - as I had . I've just had a chance to watch it on DVD and I have to say that it does hold up pretty well . I haven't read the books but apparently they were a series of unrelated episodes rather than straight stories with beginnings , middles and ends and that may account for why the Dick Van Dyke character Bert pops up as a sort of Everyfoil to the eponymous nanny and why the Ed Wynn character is there for only a single isolated sequence . No one is going to accuse the Sherman brothers of being Cole Porter - well they COULD but they'd look pretty silly when they had to back it up with hard evidence - but their knack for catchy melodies is undeniable even if their lyrics are a tad short of Porter , Larry Hart , Johnny Mercer , Frank Loesser etc , about from here to Guatamala short . Julie Andrews could probably not be bettered in the title role and this is very much a title character-led movie so although the support is well up to snuff it remains academic . Still entertains .
408806	2567136	194201	8.0	Don't Take It As Gospel	The Champo - a small cinema du quartier in Paris - is to be applauded for staging this major retrospective of Sacha Guitry ; since January of this year they've been screening one Guitry title twice a day from a pool of twenty five which means they've now screened all of them at least twice . Most of the time it's difficult to believe they come even close to the nut but today , perhaps because it was a Bank Holiday , there were about 60 patrons for the second screening at 4 pm . This is Guitry in urban mode which means sophisticated well-dressed people sitting in salons dishing dirt and playing sexual games . The only thing that comes anywhere near Guitry in this mode is Noel Coward and even that is slightly misleading ; they were both primarily playrights , yes , and they tended to write with a swizzle stick rather than a pen , yes again , but really they were chalk and cheese . This is prime Guitry , nuff said .
409543	2567136	34093	8.0	Two A Brest	Films like this were the bread and butter of French Cinema in the first two decades of Sound and this one boasts a glorious roster from Gremillon himself to Andre Cayette , an uncredited Charles Spaak and , of course , arguably the Greatest of them all , Jacques Prevert . In a film in which the sea is a major character it was a master stroke to begin the story on land and with a set piece , the wedding of one of the mariners which allows a natural chance to establish Gabin's Andre Laurent and hear his praises sung to the heavens then see him in happy domesticated mode , dancing with his wife of ten years and far from happy with his lifestyle though deeply in love with him . An S . O . S . call establishes that these men are the crew of an ocean-going tugboat who help ships in distress in return for a piece of the action . A second master stroke is the delayed appearance of Michele Morgan who we know is about to provide the love interest / temptation for Gabin . She turns out to be the ' wife ' of the morally dubious captain of the distressed ship and can't wait to leave him . The fact that shooting began in 1939 only to be halted by the outbreak of war , resumed roughly one year later has led some viewers to see this as a bridge between the poetic realism of the late thirties and the Cinema of Occupation although personally I don't buy into this whilst relishing the Prevertian ' touch ' of having Catherine ( Morgan ) hail from Le Havre which was , of course , the setting for the initial Gabin / Morgan movie Quai des Brumes . The couple of ' holes ' in the script - Morgan's husband , reluctant to let her go , makes no attempt to trace her whilst she , with no visible means of support , appears to be living in a luxury apartment - are mere cavils and whichever way you slice it this is one to treasure .
409949	2567136	38116	8.0	Still In A Fair State	Rodgers and Hammerstein were nothing if not shrewd and though they have often been spoken of as innovators they were not averse from ' borrowing ' from other sources . In 1944 , one year BEFORE State Fair , MGM released ' Meet Me In St Louis ' a wonderful ' family ' oriented movie which starts by introducing the cast as they sing the title song ; a little later there is a scene in which most of the family ' taste ' a soup being prepared by mother ( Mary Astor ) and pass comments on it . So : in this movie we begin by introducing neighbour Percy Kilbride as he drives along singing the title song , soon taken up by ' Pa ' Charles Winninger ; within minutes we have a scene in which mom ( Fay Bainter ) is seen making the mincemeat she will enter at the State Fair . Pa comes in , tastes it and declares it needs ' flavoring ' with brandy . In both cases the State Fair action is truncated possibly to avoid embarrassing comparisons with St Louis but otherwise this remains a charming film , redolent of a lost era with four competent leads - though none , of course , comes even near the magic of Judy Garland - and no less than six excellent and familiar supporting players - in addition to the aforementioned Bainter , Kilbride and Winninger there are Henry Morgan , Donald Meek and Frank McHugh . The story is soap-bubble fragile and the songs for once from this duo are ALMOST schmaltz-free though frustrated poet Hammerstein was unable to resist having a bird ' throwing his heart at the sky ' . Dick Haymes has the best voice in the movie by a country mile - with both Jeanne Crain and Dana Andrews being dubbed and Vivian Blaine sounding no better and no worse than dozens of other ' band ' singers of the time - whilst It Might As Well Be Spring is arguably the best song Rodgers and Hammerstein ever wrote . All in all it's a very pleasant nostalgic revel .
409178	2567136	48673	8.0	Do I Hear A Waltz	There are some plots that have a lot of mileage in them and will accommodate transition between media - think of the Isherwood novels Mr Norris Changes Trains that became the play I Am A Camera that became the musical Cabaret - and Arthur Laurents ' play The Time Of The Cuckoo is one of them becoming in turn this movie and subsequently the Broadway musical Do I Hear A Waltz which bombed despite or because of the composer-lyricist teaming of Dick Rodgers and Steve Sondheim . The movie works , not because of David Lean , not because of Venice and certainly not because of Rossano Brazzi but because of Katie Hepburn . She is , in a word , magic , in another word , enchanting , I could go on but it's a big Thesaurus and I'm sure you've got things to do . Brazzi was simply outclassed by Hepburn but he was virtually the only game in town if you want an Italian leading man with a track record - Mastroianni could have done it a couple of years later , Louis Jordan could have done it then and done it better but he was French . Much has been made of the city of Venice as a major character so it is a valentine , that's about the Sighs of it but no worse for that . Jeremy Spenser has a couple of scenes that may have eased him into The Roman Spring of Mrs Stone a little later but the movie belongs to Hepburn , an incandescent 48 .
408911	2567136	42949	8.0	Twelve O'Clock High	Despite a long and active career , which included amongst other things supplying the off-screen ' voice ' of Lord Haw Haw in Twelve O'Clock High and creating the role of Socrates in the Broadway production of Maxwell Anderson's Barefoot In Athens , Barry Jones was relatively unknown to cinema-goers in 1950 which made him an ideal choice for Professor Willoughby who , well-shod in London , intends to detonate a nuclear device in its centre unless the Prime Minister agrees to issue a statement prepared by Willoughby . This is one of those British films that DO stand up half a century later which is not , of course , the same as saying they are without flaws - for one thing we never see Willoughby until he has stolen the nuclear device , left home , wife and daughter and made his way to London . What we feel the loss of is a sense of seeing him being slowly driven from brilliant scientist and nondescript family man to someone prepared to unleash devastation on a great capital city . Joan Hickson and Olive Sloan are both solid in support as is Andre Morrell , charged with the task of finding Willoughby but others characters , Willoughby's daughter , his colleague and son-in-law-in-waiting are cheapest cardboard cutouts . Overall the pace is the thing that keeps it interesting , that and the period ' feel ' of a lost London . Definitely worth a look .
409998	2567136	829098	8.0	Pop Song	It's a great pity that this marvellous film was released after Atonement because it blows it out of the water . Unlike Atonement which was above all a cynical exercise in Festival film making closely allied to multi-media hype And When Did You Last See Your Father is just about making a high quality film aimed at the Art House rather than the Multiplex audience and any Awards / Nominations it happens to garner will be a bonus rather than a deliberate target . It's never been a secret that Jim Broadbent is one of Englands ' finest actors and here he gives arguably his finest performance on film ; Colin Firth on the other hand is best known for a well-polished limited range , perhaps limited by lack of opportunity rather than lack of talent and here he offers support of the highest quality . Juliet Stevenson has done far better work than this and indeed one wonders why she accepted a part that she can walk through and any film that features Sarah Lancashire is going to have at least a few worthwhile moments when she is on screen . In what amounts to a glorified cameo she comes into her own at the very end of the film in a standout scene with Colin Firth . Whilst hardly a film to send you of of the cinema with a song in your heat and a smile on your lips it is one to warm you a little and earn your respect .
410076	2567136	120857	8.0	Everything Stops ( Or It Should In This Case ) For Tea )	If you like 1 ) Nostalgia , 2 ) great acting , 3 ) loving period detail and 4 ) lavish location shooting then you can't not like this wallow in pre-war sentiment . If , on the other hand , you go wild , simple wild , for Multiplex fodder then you'll seriously wonder what is the point , in any , of this subtle , graceful charmer . No one is going to be bowled over to discover that Judi Dench , Joan Plowright and Maggie Smith are great actresses but many of us may have dismissed Lily Tomlin and Cher as lightweights before this . Judi Dench's husband , the late Michael Williams contributes one of his rare - and never less than excellent - screen performances as the English consul and Franco Zeffirelli directs this semi-autobiographical account of his early years with a sure touch . The film is something of a contradiction in terms in that despite the rise of fascism , the outbreak of war and it's conclusion , not much happens ; by that I mean that the movie is more interested in the small group of expats and the small , motherless boy , who plays a role in all their lives than the World stage . Can't really be praised enough .
410200	2567136	31067	8.0	If The Slipper Fits . . .	This is yet another Depression Era take on Cinderella - not for nothing is is the David Niven character named Merlin - designed to take people's minds off both the recent austerity and the global war waiting in the wings . What comes across strongly is the sheer professionalism from all Departments , Script , Directing , Acting , that almost succeeds in preventing awkward questions - the film begins on what Americans insist on referring to as ' the day before Christmas ' , known to the rest of the world as Christmas Eve , with Ginger Rogers being made redundant from her temporary salesperson position at Merlin's Department Store ; due to plot machinations the son of the owner of the store ( David Niven ) is moved to reinstate her and the continuity implies that she goes back to work the next day ( Christmas ) - etc . The character played by the reliable and prolific Frank Albertson ( so memorable in It's A Wonderful Life ) fluctuates between up and down like a dysfunctional yo-yo but it's a safe bet that no one in 1939 noticed any of this and were content to bask in the high Enjoyment factor . Even today it holds up pretty well if only perhaps for one first-time viewing .
409829	2567136	184483	9.0	Dark Fair	It's strange to realize that Pierre Chenal was also responsible for Clochemerle , a farce about a public toilet that went down well in England where public toilets are anything but . He had also worked with Stroheim earlier in L'Alibi ( now available from Rene Ch√¢teau ) and indeed it may be argued that Stroheim did some of his best work in his ' French ' period in such movies as La Grande Illusion , Les Disparus de St Agil etc . This time around he's a disfigured banker turned forger in the cause of love . It is , of course , debatable whether an International banker would actually patronize a fair ground but assuming he would then he's all set to meet a beautiful girl who's also blind which may be just as well given that she earns a crust by allowing a kife-thrower to use her as a target - shades of La Fille sur le pont . Chenal is working on multi-levels here so that we get part fantasy , part poetic realism , part melodrama . Hardly believing his luck Stroheim marries the girl and that could have been the cue for a happy ending but we don't want to give you that , do we , so how about the girl recovers her sight and doesn't like what she sees ; at around the same time Stroheim is getting in over his head in the counterfeiting dodge and Chenal is stirring a heady brew . With something for everyone this is truly an undiscovered gem .
409920	2567136	30457	9.0	Wolf In Ship's Clothing	Seasoned film buffs will hardly need reminding that both Robert Siodmak and Billy Wilder worked on Menshen am Sonntag in Germany but it may be useful to remind ourselves that both arrived in Hollywood via France and both of them directed at least one exceptional film there ; in Wilder's case it was Mauvaise Graine which was , as it turned out , his only French film whilst Siodmak made several but would have had his work cut out to improve on this terrific effort which reunited him with Eugen Shufften and for good measure had sets by Sandy Trauner and Pierre Prevert as Assistant Director . Non-French film buffs tend to think that in terms of leading men in thirties French cinema there was Jean Gabin and then all the rest whereas in truth Raimu was Gabin's equal as an actor but didn't take on the flashy ' outsider ' roles in which Gabin specialized and as a rule neither did Harry Baur , another who , with Michel Simon and the other two made up a formidable quartet . Here , in something of a change of pace Baur plays a gun-running sea captain - his vessel is aptly named , Minotaur - who comes home to Dunkirk and a shrew of a wife played magnificently by Gabrielle Dorziat , dies and is given the next best thing to a Viking funeral by his first mate , Albert Prejean , and crew . Siodmak and Shufftan contrive to great camera movements like the eye-glass shaped mirror - reminiscent of the billboard in The Great Gatsby in which Marcel Dalio is reflected as Baur comes looking for him - and director and cameraman are not above their own Shanghai gestures when , in a nod to Joe Sternberg they give us a cluttered waterfront half in shadow half in light . The last nod must go to Charles Spaak who turned in yet again a script liberally sprinkled with mordant dialogue . Add it to your list of must-sees .
409397	2567136	113362	9.0	Cast A Cold Eye	Having begun like most directors with small subjects Jean-Paul Rappeneau seems to have acquired a penchant for the crowded canvas given that his last three films - including this one - comprise Cyrano de Bergerac and Bon Voyage . My knowledge of the period - 1830s - is skimpy to say the least so I have no basis for questioning the authenticity or otherwise of the storyline involving both Italian patriots hiding in France and an outbreak of cholera in the Provence region but this is really academic because authentic or not it provides both a dramatic and colourful backdrop to a well-told story in which for once the Romantic element is understated . Olivier Martinez is sufficiently athletic to carry out lots of Errol Flynn-like engagements with a dozen assailants at once and come off incredibly best but he is woefully lacking in Flynn's abundant charm / charisma so it's just as well that leading lady Juliette Binoche has enough for both . Not least of its assets is the support , never more than ten or fifteen minutes in each case , from some of the finest actors in France from Isabelle Huppert to Jean Yanne to Francois Cluzot to Pierre Arditi . A fine film from a fine director .
409944	2567136	111342	9.0	Dorks Rift	This is just one more example of why French cinema is the best in the world . No real story , no suspense , no sex , no violence BUT ! also no cgi , no slasher movie # 24 , no Hollywood Formula - The Sequel . In short just two of the finest actors on the planet running with a situation in which virtually out of the blue the wife tells the husband she is in love with another man . It's never that quite out of the blue of course and one of the strengths of this movie is the writing on the wall which is in turn projected onto the screen ; the smallest hairline fractures in what , on the surface , is a perfect marriage complete with child . Juliette Binoche is a fine actress , no question , but it is virtually impossible to picture anyone other than Isabelle Huppert in the role of Anne and the same applies to Daniel Auteuil as Pierre , each of them fully inhabits the role in which they have been cast and although there is outstanding support from Jerome Deschamps and Karin Viard it is really superfluous . One of the finest films of the 90s , not just from France but from anywhere but it helps if you go to movies to check out the Human Condition rather than to spray popcorn at each other .
409222	2567136	85370	9.0	They Were ' Sisters '	This is a fine movie any way you look at it in fact I'll amend that to Fine / Great and I'd love to own it on DVD so that I could run it just before La Baule-les-pins ( which I do own ) and which covers the same autobiographical data from another angle . For the record both films are based on the early life of writer-director Diane Kurys and both concern the unhappy marriage of her parents - a character based on herself appears in both movies . Coup de foudre begins before she was born with the meeting of her parents in a ' camp ' in Occupied France during World War II . A guy whose release is already guaranteed spots Isabelle Huppert , falls in love on the spot ( hense the title ) and smuggles her a note proposing marriage . Somewhat bemused she agrees only to become angry because his name reeks of Jewishness . Somewhat improbably they remain together , have two daughters and settle in Lyon . Simultaneously we are introduced to the second leading character ( Miou-Miou ) , an artist whose husband is shot by the Germans and dies in her arms . She too ' settles ' for something less than love and marries an actor ( Jean-Pierre Bacri ) whose life is a succession of get-rich-quick schemes that backfire . The two women meet by chance in 1952 and form a friendship that soon eclipses anything they feel for their respective partners whilst stopping short of overt lesbianism . Huppert and Miou-Miou have their parts down cold and it's fascinating to see Bacri with a full head of hair looking remarkably like Louis Jordan . This is a wonderful film on our old friend the Human Condition illustrating just how easy it is to screw up our lives . The pertinent questions - like why did Huppert stay with someone she didn't love once she was clear of the Camp , let alone after the war , don't raise their quizzical heads til long afterwards such is the strength of both movie and performances . In La Baule-les-pins the Huppert character , Lena ( now played by Nathalie Baye ) is still with her husband but clearly only for a matter of time and the two girls are still in the thick of the misery . Both are highly recommended .
408843	2567136	18187	9.0	Towering Achievement	To be able to see this rare gem at all is fortuitous ; to be able to see it in time for it to be my 1 , 000th review for IMDb is a new definition of serendipity and once again I am deeply indebted to the guy in Norway who has supplied me with so many great French movies . Well over my 1 , 000 reviews are French movies and many of those were the work of Julien Duvivier who is still , alas , awaiting his rightful recognition as one of the truly Great French film makers whose career began in the Silent Era and ended abruptly in the 1960s . This gem dates from 1927 and as I watched it I seriously thought that the screenplay must be the work of Harry Stephen Keeler , an almost forgotten American novelist whose surreal off-the-wall plots were like those of no other writer and had titles like The Man With The Magic Eardrums , The Skull Of The Waltzing Clown etc . Here we have a heady brew indeed ; faux Siamese Twins , one of whom is cheated out of an inheritance by his double , a bizarre sect known as Ku-Klux-Eiffel who go around in Black hoods as opposed to the White hoods of the original Ku-Klux Klan , and exist apparently to jam French radio broadcasts by means of a secret code . When the impostor is installed in his ch√¢teau the sect - who are ' advised ' by someone glorying in the name Li-Ho-Ha - ' haunt ' him until he leaves and prevails upon the real heir , Achillis Saturnin , to take his place in return for 500 , 000 francs . Still to come is a bizarre fight on the Eiffel Tower itself before the obligatory happy ending . Duvivier employs what for the time was a very fluid camera cutting from Master Shot to Close Up to Cutaway adroitly and injecting the free-wheeling plot with consummate pacing . A soundtrack of sorts supplements the title cards from time to time with FX such as a plane buzzing the protagonists and music and song elsewhere . This is a film that cries out for reissue and rediscovery and is a must-see for Duvivier buffs and admirers of French cinema in general .
408753	2567136	42792	9.0	The Great Racist	This is from the first great flowering of Mank the writer / director ; in 1949 he made House Of Strangers and A Letter To Three Wives , in 1950 he made this one and All About Eve , after that came People Will Talk and Five Fingers . This falls well within the Fox series of late forties films addressing social problems - Pinky , Gentlemen's Agreement , etc - and in many ways it's the strongest and most hard-hitting of the bunch . Widmark - the most mild-mannered of men in private life - was perfectly cast as Ray Biddle , the small-time hood spewing racist vitriol practically every time he opens his mouth , perhaps only Joseph Wiseman and Robert Ryan among his contemporaries could have even tackled such a role . Sydney Poitier , in his first film as anything more than an extra gave us his first essay in the ' noble savage ' role he must have grown bored with by the next decade and arguably Mank loaded the dice by having the Black man be not only intellectually and educationally superior to the White but also morally . Stephen MacNally moved fluidly between hero and villain - that same year he played ' heavy ' Dutch Henry Brown in Winchester 73 - and it was a pity his career stalled before the decade was out . Here he plays the senior doctor who has faith in and respect for Poitier whilst the fourth member of the leading quartet is Linda Darnell , a Fox contract artist who Mank had already used to good effect in A Letter To Three Wives . As the ex-wife of Widmark's brother , whom Poitier is unable to save , she gives a quietly effective performance . For its time this was bold , imaginative film-making and even today it holds up well . Certainly one for the DVD collection .
409985	2567136	34075	9.0	Adam Had Four Sons	this was the last film that the great Harry Baur made in France and the next-to-last film he made anywhere for having completed it he was conned into travelling to Germany to shoot what would prove to be his 79th and last movie after which he was tortured to death by the Nazis . Given these tragic circumstances one may be tempted to praise the final French film irrespective of whether or not it was up to snuff but I'm delighted to say that it is an excellent effort even if a tad derivative - a few years earlier Julien Duvivier had made one of his finest films as well as one of the finest of the thirties , Un Carnet de bal , in which a middle-aged woman sets out to trace the partners on her first dance card ; now , with a little spin Harry Baur , acutely aware of time's winged chariot drawing near , sets out on a similar quest but in this case his quarries are the four sons he fathered by four separate women in his salad days . Predictably things don't go to plan but we do get four well-crafted stories for the price of one and as if that weren't enough the ubiquitous Gabrielle Fontan is on hand to add a touch of class . Baur was a credit to the French film industry and is as irreplaceable as Raimu , Michel Simon or Gabin and his final French film leaves an enduring memory
409635	2567136	53459	9.0	The Eyes Have It	Over and above the technical brilliance , sure-footed storytelling and top-class acting on display here is the fact that this film was released in 1960 , a defiant nose-thumb from a real filmmaker to those petulant schoolboys , Godard and Truffaut , so busy with their hand-held Arris , Sun-guns and Nagras , playing at being directors , that they had no time and / or inclination to stop and see how the Big Boys do it , this being a prime example and it's nice to think that it's quality product such as this that tsunamied the new wavelet out of existence . It's probably not just coincidence that Franju employed Eugen Shuftan as his cameraman . Shuftan's roots were in the German Expressionism which informs every frame of Eyes Without A Face and ironically in borrowing from an earlier era Franju has done what all good filmmakers do and created a world of his own replete with genius verging on madness , Gothic horror and the obligatory ' secret ' room where unspeakable deeds are done and Franju has been imitated both in Art ( Corps a corps ) and Life - I write this as the tale of the Austrian monster who imprisoned his own daughter in a dungeon for 24 years is filling the headlines . He is well served by his actors , Pierre Brasseur , Alida Valli and Edith Scob and for good measure his son , Claude ( now a respected actor in his own right and still going strong ) has a supporting role as a flic . A key work in French cinema .
409462	2567136	42988	9.0	The Sky's The Limit	This is a brilliant example of the kind of well-crafted Professional film that had those overgrown children at Cahiers du Cinema throwing their toys out of the pram and mounting a weak resistance via the New Wavelet that was shipping serious water within a decade . Julien Duvivier left more Craftsmanship on the Cutting Room floor than Godard managed to include in his total output and Sous Le Ciel finds him on top of his game in the kind of multi-strand story he gave us in his classic Un Carnet du bal . This time around he concentrates on a single day , dusk to dawn in Paris and moves deftly between a group of people who may or may not have cause to remember this one day . It's arguable that Duvivier and / or his writing collaborator ex-actor Rene Lefevre ( who , by complete coincidence , I saw acting in Les Musiciens du ciel less than a week ago ) got the ' idea ' from Norman Collins ' novel London Belongs To Me , which reached the screen in the late 1940s but the characters there had in common the rooming house in which they all lived and the action spanned several months but wherever the idea originated it's adaptation is masterful . Color would have been detrimental to this story which takes in an industrial strike where one of the characters spends the day - his wedding anniversary - on the picket line , a training hospital where a student has no problem with practicalities but sucks at passing exams , a boat ride on the Seine ending in a quarrel between the two children concerned , a photo-shoot which allows for some spectacular shots through fountains plus three people wandering the city , one old spinster who hasn't got change of a match trying in vain to scare up some food for her home full of cats , one young girl just arrived from the provinces and perhaps most significant of all the young sculptor slowly becoming manic enough to plunge a knife into a stranger . Some of these lives will connect , some will just miss , some of the characters will have problems erasing this day from their memories , some will forget it in a moment , a month or a year , but we won't be amongst them .
409368	2567136	16232	9.0	Black And Blue Red	Julien Duvivier had been directing for five years during which he'd turned out ten titles before this , his eleventh in 1925 and though I shouldn't be surprised - I have , after all , seen and / or own the majority of his Sound films - at the sheer craftsmanship and quality that permeates every frame I'm lost in admiration for a true Master . Stunning visuals abound and the title-cards are spare and to the point , Redtop's mother is shown , crone-like and a title card says it all , nasty gossip . Soon we are introduced to the eponymous Carrot Top , her youngest son , and here Duvivier superimposes stunning images of his tormentors onto the sheet of writing paper in front of him as he sits at his desk in school . The use of Opticals throughout is breathtaking for the time and enhance what is basically a Cinderella story with a happy ending . The novel was clearly close to Duvivier's heart because he filmed it again in 1932 with a cast that was more well-known , Harry Baur , Margaret Fontenay and Robert Lynen but apart from Sound there is little to choose between two brilliant films .
408939	2567136	64165	9.0	Like Raindrops On Roses . . .	. . . a few of My favourite things are the films of Claude Sautet such as Cesar et Rosalie , Vincent , Francois , Paul et les autres , Nelly et M . Arnaud and The Things Of Life , the film that marked both a change of direction and a maturity in Sautet's career . The premise is hardly original ; a man is involved in a car crash and as he nears death his life flashes before him . In other hands this could be maudlin , gauche , embarrassing or all three but writers like Jean-Loup Dabadie ( who worked with Sautet on two of the exceptional films he made with Yves Montand , Cesar et Rosalie and Vincent , Francois , Paul et les autres ) and directors like Sautet don't do maudlin , gauche , etc and as if the technical credits weren't enough we have actors like Michel Piccoli and Romy Schneider to put the icing on the cake . This is one that stands up to repeated viewings .
409363	2567136	44893	9.0	Well-Met By Starlight	Anyone who saw this on its initial release in 1952 would not have been surprised when Sinatra unveiled his considerable ' acting ' chops in his very next movie , From Here To Eternity for Meet Danny Wilson is a perfect Halfway House between the gauche Clarence in Anchors Aweigh ( typical of all Sinatra's roles in the 40s , with the possible exception of Miracle Of The Bells which extended his range only to the extent of putting him in a dog-collar ) and Maggio in Eternity . Here is the Sinatra the real fans knew and admired , primarily a great singer but also a flawed human being , volatile , arrogant , brash . Don McGuire weighs in with a tasty script with some great zingers and uses just enough material from Sinatra's real life to please the cognoscenti . A rare title today but one central to the Sinatra collection and unmissable .
408827	2567136	35979	9.0	Van Cleve And ( H ) Arp ( H ) ells	Lubitsch was on a roll in 1943 ; since 1938 he had made Bluebeard's Eighth Wife , Ninotchka , The Shop Around The Corner , That Uncertain Feeling and To Be Or Not To Be , five classics one after another and although he would complete two more movies and leave one unfinished Heaven Can Wait was his last undisputed masterpiece . Only watch this if you value Style , Wit , Charm , Sophistication and gentle storytelling but if you do respond to those qualities you'll adore this story of a lovable roue ' who is quite content to wind up in hell with no regrets , an attitude that intrigues Laird Creagar's devil , so much so that he prevails upon Henry Van Cleve to recount his life on earth . As Van Cleve the normally wooden Don Ameche actually gives a performance under the tuition of Lubitsch , one that is matched by leading lady Gene Tierney but this duo is only the tip of an iceberg comprising the cream of Hollywood supporting actors from Charles Coburn through Spring Byington , Clarence Muse , Eugene Palette , Marjorie Main and Allyn Joslyn . An utter delight .
409284	2567136	33045	10.0	Clerk Watching	This , despite not being the original - it began life as a play in Central Europe - has weathered the several incarnations that followed ( MGM's own remake with period songs In The Good Old Summertime , the Broadway show She Loves Me , even the excellent theatre revival in Paris a couple of years ago ) and remains the definitive version and the one they all have to beat . Several previous commenters have identified the contributing factors that make it so successful and memorable not least being the prevailing fashion in 30s and 40s Hollywood for lavishing attention and detail on ensemble playing rather than just two leads as so often happens today - try , for example , removing Ugarte , Ferrari , Renault etc from Casablanca and yes you'd still have Rick and Ilsa and Viktor Lazslo but they'd just be frosting without the rich cake mixture below . Jimmy Stewart and Maggie Sullavan WERE both ideal and irreplaceable leads but how much brighter they shine when their performances are reflected in those of Frank Morgan , Felix Bressart , Joseph Schildkraut and Andy Hardy's Sara Haden and this is BEFORE we factor in that Lubitsch ' touch ' . Okay , maybe they WERE a tad more naive , innocent even , in that Jurassic Age but how many genuine film lovers , sated with scatology , screwing and in-your-face sex , turn back to those days of Stories , Style , Slickness and Skill and wallow in great movies like this one . By far the best thing about this technological age is not CSI but DVD that can at one and the same time make these classics available to nostalgics and show the Matrix freaks how the big boys used to do it .
409808	2567136	405094	10.0	The Worst Years Of Our Lives	This film has just opened in London and I attended one of the first screenings . I wish I could add something to the whole host of superlatives made by previous posters . This is a truly awesome film , at the very least a mini masterpiece and possibly even a fully-fledged one . With the best will in the world people in the West can never really KNOW what it was like to live in a state of constant long-distance supervision but this film - made by a native of West Germany who , by definition , has never known it either - comes as close as any to making us privy to that sensation . All the credits are impeccable from Writing , Directing down to the smallest ' extra ' and it is wonderful to see Martina Gedeck , so great as Bella Martha , and Sebastian Koch , equally good in Black Book , once more but excellent as both are they are outshone by Ulrich Muhe as the Stasi official charged with monitoring their lives . Weighing in at a little over two hours and with no sex or violence to speak of the film nevertheless rivets the attention by - if not in spite of - the very grayness which informs it with Muhe , himself a victim of Stasi surveillance , outstanding as he mutates from automaton to human being but totally from WITHIN ( no dramatic histrionics here to symbolize his volte-face , just acting of the most subtle kind ) . A film incapable of being overpraised and one that should be seen by every discerning film-goer .
409958	2567136	41587	10.0	Three On A Match	Another 5 star entry from Mank ( in passing could I point out that it was Joe's older brother Herman who co-wrote Citizen Kane with Awesome and not Joe himself as at least one poster seems to think ) and what irony that the actress who steals everything that isn't nailed down , the great Thelma Ritter , isn't even Credited . Unquestionably one of the best writers in Hollywood Mank sets the scene with his usual efficiency via the voice-over of the unseen catalyst Addie Ross ( voiced by Celeste Holm who would have a featured role in Mank's standout follow up All About Eve , as would Ritter ) who shows us first the town and then five of the six principals . Although Mank can't take credit for the premise - it was adapted from a published source - he surely put a generous amount of top spin on it ; in a nutshell the unseen narrator kick-starts the story proper via a letter written jointly to three of her married friends stating that she has run off with one of their husbands . The letter is delivered as the three wives embark on a pleasure boat at the start of a day trip for under-privileged children which means that each has plenty of time to reflect on her respective marriage , all of which are prime candidates for Addie to sever . Mank being Mank he has already shown us the cracks in the first two marriages ; in the first - and weakest - Jeffrey Lynn is leaving on a business trip and warns his wife , Jeanne Crain , that he may be away overnight ; in the second Kirk Douglas behaves out of character by wearing a suit on a Saturday , something which is not noticed by his wife , Ann Southern , until Jeanne Crain points it out to her . These scenes precede the receipt of the letter so that only in retrospect do we realize how masterfully Mank has crafted his story . He disliked Jeanne Crain intensely yet was forced to use her again later by the studio in People Will Talk opposite Cary Grant . As noted the Lynn-Crain pairing is the weakest of the three but because the other two - Ann Southern / Kirk Douglas , Linda Darnell / Paul Douglas are so strong we're prepared to tolerate Lynn and Crain . One of the revelations is Darnell , largely used as cheesecake because of her undeniable good looks but here given some acidic one-liners by Mank she lobs them unerringly where they will do the most good . Connie Gilchrist also weighs in with strong support as Darnell's mother whilst Paul Douglas has seldom been better . As a writer himself Mank throws a lot of his better lines to Kirk Douglas , playing a dedicated schoolteacher who despises commercial radio which is a shame because his wife , Southern , writes for it . All in all this is a great movie full of wit , charm , great writing and direction so what are you waiting for , get down to Blockbuster on the double .
409143	2567136	34891	10.0	Timeless Capsule	It's very difficult to watch this masterpiece without a lump in the throat . Noel Coward and Terence Rattigan , two homosexuals , produced between them ( The Way To The Stars and this film ) THE two definitive British films of World War Two which must surely give students or irony pause . To watch this film in the 21st century is to get the feeling that the ' ordinary ' people depicted here were living not in England but on another planet , one where decency , honesty and moral values were taken for granted and not the joke they have become in the subsequent years . Coward , of course , was a master of the well-made play and his screenplay is as technically sound as a Louis The Fourteenth commode and as visually stunning as a Faberge egg . With hindsight it is possible to identify Coward ' signatures ' - in This Happy Breed John Mills was the sailor next door in love with the flighty Kay Walsh who he lost only to find again ; this time around Walsh is more grounded , they meet , fall in love and marry ; Joyce Carey , the tyrant of the Tea Room in Brief Encounter , is here portrayed far more sympathetically as the wife of Petty Officer Bernard Miles and her ongoing war with her mother replicates that of Celia Johnson in This Happy Breed , etc - that only enhance the watching experience . We watch the Torrin from birth to death - a brilliant opening montage begins with a skeleton of the hull and ends with the champagne bottle striking it - and focus on the survivors in or clinging to one of the lifeboats . This is , of course , our old friend the Hollywood Bomber Crew syndrome but Coward's artistry and craftsmanship transcends the mundane and gives us a cross-section of flesh-and-blood characters spanning the social spectrum of an England at war . Like Rattigan's The Way To The Stars this is a film in which EVERYTHING works superbly , writing , acting , direction and frankly is woefully inadequate to rate such a magnificent effort .
409830	2567136	30127	10.0	Baker's Dozen	This one comes with a rep that almost dares you NOT to like it for none other than the Great Orson Welles declared it the greatest movie ever made and star Raimu the greatest actor . Welles is no slouch himself and many there are , including myself , who consider his own Citizen Kane to be in the all-time No # 1 spot but , let's face it , old Awesome knows a thing or two when it comes to judging celluloid . This is , of course , a Marcel Pagnol production which presupposes several things ; it will be set in the South of France barely a Long Shot from Marseille and it's twelve to seven to feature Raimu heading an ensemble cast of Pagnol regulars . So it is here with Raimu as the eponymous baker who has barely sold his first batch than his wife takes it on the Jesse Owens with the local stud . The smiles , if not outright belly laughs , on the faces of the villagers freeze pretty damn quick once they realize that no wife equals no bread which means that they set about locating and returning the wife . End of ( very simple ) story . But as someone once said it's the way you tell them and Pagnol has Scherezade beat seven ways from the middle ; once again as in his celebrated trilogy ( Marius , Fanny , Cesar , in case you just got here via a wormhole ) he evokes an entire community with just a few strokes of the pen or , in this case , lens , so that what we have is a lovingly painted portrait of a small town not a million miles from the one Jack Ford devised for The Quiet Man and complete with a richly assorted set of residents . The closing scene where the errant wife ignites the fire in the oven may be a tad symbolic but when it occurs in such a warm film who cares .
409269	2567136	111579	10.0	All In The Golden Afternoon	Though I love Chekhov the better a production of one of his masterpieces I see the sadder I am that I am still missing wonderful nuances because 1 ) I don't speak Russian and 2 ) I have no Direct , or Primary Source if you will , knowledge of Russia and so have to rely on reasonably extensive reading which is , of course , no substitute . So in effect I know no more of Stalinist Russia than I do of , say , Wonderland , the Wonderland from which I selected my Summary for this critique but the fact that I cannot speak Jabberwock doesn't prevent me from enjoying Alice In Wonderland and nor does my lack of Russian prevent me from savouring this wonderful evocation of a totally corrupt regime viewed largely through a prism of innocence if not ignorance . In many ways there is a feeling of late Chekov here in the scenes of a languorous summer afternoon viewed through the eyes of an ex-aristocratic family gathered on a Chekhovian dacha in which they have succeeded in keeping reality at bay . Those with a taste for metaphor will find it in the delivery driver going around in circles before eventually being shot and those with a taste for acting of the highest quality will find it in the Writer-Director and Leading Man , Kotov , in his nemesis Mitya , and even in his own real-life daughter , Nadya . Love , Death , Pain , Laughter , Tears , Joy , Anguish , Bitterness , Despair are all present and correct in this exceptional melange which is too rich to savour at one sitting and requires multiple viewings . Did I say masterpiece ? In spades .
409831	2567136	29706	10.0	Shadow Waltz	This is one of the Great ones : In terms of French cinema in the first full decade of Sound it belongs right up there with Marius , Fanny , Cesar , Quai des Brumes , Le Jour se leve , La Femme du boulanger , La Grande Illusion and you can't put anything higher than that though Duvivier's own La Belle equipe and Pepe Le Moko both come within a whisker . It's the kind of film that would be difficult to make today as would , for example , Dial M For Murder . Frederick Knott wrote Dial as a play in the early fifties and the Hitchcock film version was released in 1954 BUT the entire plot ( our old friend the ' perfect ' murder ) hinged on the fact that in those days only the upper and middle classes had telephones at all and those were in fixed locations and in this era of jack points and cell phones the idea of someone obliged to answer a telephone located on a desk in front of heavy drapes behind which a murderer was lurking ready to strike when the phone was answered would be ludicrous . Carnet is similar inasmuch as ' dance cards ' are unheard of today belonging as they do to a world of stately dancing and courtly manners where even a ' nice ' girl would as soon turn up to a dance totally naked as without a ' full ' dance card - many of us will remember how , in Meet Me In St Louis , Judy Garland and Lucille Bremner ' marked ' the dance card of an out-of-towner loading it with every dead-beat in town . So , yes , it is archaic but fortunately those of us who care to can have archaic and eat it courtesy of the Art / Revival House , Movie Channels on TV and / or the DVD . Living by a lake a widow comes face to face with what today we would call a mid-life crisis ; vaguely melancholic and slightly wistful lest she did , as she suspects , marry the wrong man , she allows her thoughts to drift to her first dance and the names on her very first dance card who , on a whim , she decides to trace . WE know of course that you can't go home again even if we've never even heard of Tom Wolfe let alone read him but thankfully Christine feels otherwise . It was a nice touch to find that the first name on the card is dead - but try telling that to his mother , the great Francoise Rosay - as if to say right from the word go that love dies , baby , if you neglect it . One by one via a night-club semi racketeer , a monk , a ski instructor , the mayor of a small town , an epileptic doctor with a lucrative sideline in abortion and a gay hairdresser the scales fall and / or are stripped from her eyes leaving her sadder but wiser . Some of the top names in French cinema step up to the plate , Harry Baur , Louis Jouvet , Fernandel etc and no one strikes out . Henri Jeanson and Julien Duvivier brought honour to the French cinema with this one that remains a must-see and before I sign off let me acknowledge a genuine altruistic contributor to these boards who , with exceptional kindness , sent me not only this gem but seventeen others . Watch this space .
409780	2567136	31725	10.0	Tenderized Comrade	When I saw this film first , perhaps twenty years ago , I was so ignorant of things Russian that I thought the Garbo character had actually been christened Ninotchka and / or it was a genuine Christian name . Since then I've learned that Russians have a charming habit of ' tenderising ' names by adding a suffix so that Nina , for example , can be ' tenderized ' to Ninotchka . I saw the film again recently in Paris where one Art House in particular seems to run virtually continuous Lubitsch retrospectives . When I saw it recently I knew that Ninotcka had been christened Nina and you know what ? It didn't make that much difference . It was a GREAT movie when I saw it first and it's STILL a Great movie , tenderizer or not . I'm also slightly astounded that on the credits on this Board the name of Billy Wilder is omitted ( unless , you click on ' more ' ) which is not unlike omitting the names of Lubitsch and Garbo because apart from the Lubitsch ' touch ' the Wilder touch is evident in every frame . On this board you will find a large selection of ' quotations ' from the film , arguably as many if not more than yielded by Casablanca and in every one the caustic tongue of Wilder is clearly detectable . In fact the whole film reeks of Wilder and his penchant for what we might call the cyanide souffl√© , the light-as-air romantic comedy laced with cynical barbs directed - in this case - mostly at the Russia of Stalin . I've looked in vain for a dull moment , every observation is right on the money , the characters are flesh and blood as opposed to cardboard and the leading character undergoes the obligatory volte face two thirds of the way through . The thirties provided some of the all-time great movie comedies - not least two of Wilder's own in Bluebreard's Eighth Wife and Midnight - but this is the one they all have to beat . Rating ? Off the chart .
409674	2567136	31309	10.0	At The End Of The Day . . .	. . . this has to be ranked as one of the finest films about Acting as a Profession and Actors as human beings . Noel Coward gave us his own take on the subject in his 1960 play Waiting In The Wings and whilst he may have got more mileage out of his multi-layered title - " The Wings " is the name of the theatrical Retirement Home where Coward's actors wait to die and , of course , actors wait in the ' wings ' of a theatre for their cue to enter - he didn't eclipse this great Duvivier-Spaak collaboration shot in the shadow of World War II which gives it yet another strata . Duvivier was at his best with large ensembles and here he excels once again with a cast largely unknown outside France with the obvious exception of Michel Simon , outstanding as the joker of the establishment but living a lie inasmuch as he spent his entire career as an understudy rather than an actual performer , and Louis Jouvet , the Errol Flynn-lite ageing swordsman . Whilst the ensemble may be relatively unknown to non-vintage French film buffs they will be a revelation to anyone stumbling on this movie by chance ; Spaak and Duvivier chronicle all the minutiae of egos trapped by age and condemned to live out their days together like members of a Touring company in Blossom Time , back-biting , fighting over scraps of food , reliving their triumphs , boring others and being bored BY others . A barrel of laffs it's not but it IS a masterpiece . ( Once again I am hugely indebted to the guy from Norway who is so generous with his massive film library .
409331	2567136	40338	10.0	Stairway To Paradise ( Or Not , As The Case May Be )	In my memory I have always rated this higher than the subsequent ( one year later ) Greene-Reed collaboration The Third Man and now that it has just been re-issued I see no reason to amend that verdict . Coincidentally both films turn to the Continent for their love interest , respectively Michele Morgan and Alida Valli and if Morgan was , hands down , the superior actress , both led with expressive eyes and shared the same waif-like build . Here Morgan does wonders with a part that on paper is almost non-existent and gets across wonderfully the anguish of a young girl living away from home in a foreign country and turning for emotional sustenance to a man one step up from a husk by virtue of a shrewish wife who has , over the years , sucked all the spirit out of him . Ralph Richardson turns in one of his finest ever film performances supported by Sonia Dresdel as the shrew and Bobby Henrey as Philippe , the ten-year old catalyst is beyond praise in a role that , like so many child actors , he was never able to replicate or even approach in later years . Sprinkled throughout like hundreds and thousands on a celebratory cake are cameos from the likes of Dandy Nichols , Jack Hawkins , Geoffrey Keene and Dora Bryan phoning in her perennial tart-with-a-heart . For me this is far and away the best thing Reed ever did though others will probably disagree and I've already ordered the DVD .
408770	2567136	48966	10.0	Outfoxed	I haven't seen Norman Brook's play ' Fragile Fox ' on which James Poe based his screenplay , indeed I doubt if many people saw it but it's reasonable to suppose that Poe has ' opened it out ' considerably and in doing so effectively ' shown ' us what could presumably only be spoken of onstage . What is undeniable is that Robert Aldrich brought out the best of Jack Palance ; this is one of two films they made together back to back in 1956 and both are outstanding . Coincidentally both were adapted from stage plays though Cliff Odet's ' The Big Knife ' enjoyed by far the highest profile of the two in theatrical terms . It's fun trying to speculate which of the several interiors Brooks used in his play but what Poe has done is to weave together seamlessly ' action ' and dialogue and the result is a near-perfect movie . War , of course , is only a convenient backdrop for the exploration of human nature in extremis with , at one end of the spectrum , Costa's ( Palance ) courage and humane love of the men under his command and at the other Cooney's ( Eddie Albert ) moral bankruptcy and cowardice . Approaching the centre of the spectrum from either ends are Lee Marvin's Clyde Bartlett , overall commander of the company who is more than aware of Albert's failings but needs his clout ( Cooney's father is a judge back home ) to further his post-war political aspirations and William Smither's Woodruff , in complete accord with Palance ( and , it must be said ) the entire platoon in both contempt for and hatred of Albert but much prefers to approach things through channels and ' by the book ' rather than take a confrontational ' hands-on ' stance like Palance . This is a great film on any level in which you care to judge it and in tandem with The Big Knife marks the apex of both Adrich's and Palance's careers .
