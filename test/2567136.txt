408991	2567136	42911	1.0	Dire Streets	There's only one comment on this title and it is by someone who , like my , loves French films , is contemptuous of the new wavelet and admires some of the same directors - Duvivier , Carne , Cayette , Tourneur etc . On the other hand we do on occasion see things differently usually when one of us is with disappointed and the other finds pleasure in a given title . This is both understandable and explainable inasmuch as one of us live in a France whose television provides access to a regular stream of the best French films of all vintages whilst the other lives in an England starved of French films . In the case of this title however we are in complete accord : This is dire , almost as bad as anything by Godard . Imagine a film crew penetrated the deepest jungles of Guyana , shot a documentary and left the equipment behind . The natives , cut off from civilization then stumbled on a routine rejected by the Marx Brothers in their first year in vaudeville and persuaded a group of failed burlesque comics to play in it . Multiply this by ten and you're still nowhere near the depths this plumbs .
409379	2567136	475331	3.0	Nice Flute , Shame About The Magic	Kenneth Branagh could well have subtitled his second turkey in as many weeks and his third this year The Cranes Are Flying for yes , folks , our Ken has discovered a thing that you can mount the camera on and it will then climb in the air and allow you to shoot the film from the point of view of a cloud and that's his angle of choice for a good 30 per cent of the running time ; if this was a ploy to detract from his lack of ideas then it doesn't work and only draws attention to the pretentiousness on display . It's got to be a prime gobbler when Liz Smith pointedly excludes it from her CV and presumably asked for her name to be removed from the credits . Stephen Fry has the chutzpah to take a bow for the lyrics ; it's patently obvious that he has never heard of Cole Porter , Lorenz Hart , Frank Loesser , etc , let alone studied them , in fact if it comes to that he hasn't even bothered to study a Rhyming Dictionary and is clearly a paid-up member of the Kiss My Assonance School Of Lyric Writing . Branagh himself is clearly an advocate of the If It Ain't Broke , Break It , brigade for having set Shakespeare in Japan earlier in the year he now sets Mozart in the First World War but not the one you may have seen in the newsreels where the trenches were furnished with a melange of mud and rats ; you could EAT off the floors of these trenches and though he allows an occasional rifle shot for authenticity infantrymen topple over without so much as a scratch let alone any of that nasty blood . This doesn't leave a lot on the positive side ; okay , the singers Mime effectively enough , they are , after all , mostly trained opera singers but apart from that there's a two-hour gap where the film should be .
409871	2567136	56467	4.0	Deadly Affairs	There's clearly a lot of mileage in the seven deadly sins as the several film versions testify . There was a half-decent version in 1952 , ten years earlier than this entry , one that had the advantage of talents like Michele Morgan going for it . It's hard to find anything to like here ; certainly not the Godard segment which is a bigger joke than his breakthrough movie Brainless . In that one he followed Jean-Paul Belmondo with a hand-held camera as he walked up the Champs Elysee and back down again . Anxious to show how far he has come on this time he follows Eddie Constantine as he Drives from the Billancourt studios into Paris proper . Some progress . Elsewhere we have the one about the group of students who pool their resources so that one of them can get laid by a top-of-the-range hooker , a bizarre piece about flies in the soup leading to Armageddon , a Biter Bit episode and other unimaginative segments . Basically it's a waste of sprocket holes .
409540	2567136	61398	4.0	Barnum & Bailey Won't You Please Come Home	It's a truth universally acknowledged that to bring out star quality you need star opposition ; put Roger Federer in with Rafael Nadal and he'll pull out that little something extra , put him in with Tim Henman and he'll phone it in . As it is with athletes so it is with actors , put Joan Crawford up against Bette Davis and she'll raise her game but surround her with the cream of second and third rate British film actors and she can hardly be bothered to offer a Masterclass in how the Big Girls do it . Throw in a plot that would give Morons From Outer Space a run for its money and ain't nobody from this production gonna be looking for the mailman come Oscar nomination time - let's face it , this one is gonna have a tough time getting nominated for the Golden Turkey . This is the kind of film where a guy who travels with a circus wears a suit and tie and given this dress sense it's not so surprising that this guy ( Michael Gough if anyone asks you ) not only wanders into the Big Top in the middle of the night for no apparent reason other than to smoke a cigarette and THEN chooses to lean nonchalantly against the very spot where a VERY NASTY person is waiting to drive a spike right through his head , quite a trick given the strength required and ludicrous when the killer turns out to be someone who weighs about two ounces less than a lemon soufflé ' . Crawford is watchable , just about , but the likes of Diana Dors and Ted - who - told - him - he - could - act - Lune are frankly embarrassing . Definitely one to miss .
409678	2567136	91538	4.0	There Goes Mr . Jordan	Neil Jordan is a graduate of the Ken Loach I-Hate-England school of film-making which means that like Loach he spurns no opportunity to explore its worst aspects in loving detail . This time around it's the sex industry that sleazes its way into his spotlight . The story is improbable-to-ridiculous , one leave it out , guv , after another . Why , for example does Michael Caine's Mr Big wait til Bob Hoskins gets out of the slammer before hiring a driver for Cathy Tyson's hooker - what did she do before , take a bus ? In turn why does Tyson wait until their initial antipathy has thawed before asking him to locate another hooker when 1 ) surely the world of London hookers is not that large , there's obviously some kind of network whereby one can locate another without charming a violent oak into doing the job and 2 ) for what she spent kitting out Hoskins with shirts , suit and topcoat in a trendy Men's Store she could have hired a private detective for a month but given how easy the hooker was to find he'd have taken about a day and a half tops . This leaves us with the acting ; for Hoskins it's the mixture as before , all contained violence and effing and blinding , sure he was phoning it in by that stage , Robbie Coltrane is totally unconvincing and Mike Tyson could have done as well as Cathy . Okay , it's twenty years old - a freebie with a newspaper , just as well I didn't spend more than the price of a paper I buy anyway on this pap - and maybe at the time it looked better but it's way past its sell-by date .
409703	2567136	72305	4.0	Is There REALLY A Market For This . . .	. . . other than Les Halles - the ' stomach of Paris ' had recently been razed to the ground and this . . . I hesitate to use the word film . . . was filmed in the space created . Fereira acknowledges no rules of logic ; time and again we are told we are in Washington DC or in Dakota , scene of the Little Big Horn aka Custer's Last Stand yet all the shop signs are in French and there is even the occasional street sign bearing the legend : Rue ; there are even more specific references to President Nixon - indeed his photograph is prominent , yet most of the principals are dressed for the nineteenth century , including Catherine Deneuve . Somehow , and God KNOWS how , Fereira is able to get fine actors to forget all their training and turn in performances that would be unacceptable in a Church hall and I myself am equally naive , having seen ONE Feriera piece of crap in the same season as this I knowingly and willingly subjected myself to a second using the logic that NOTHING could be worse than Dillinger Is Dead . Boy , Did I Get A Wrong Number .
410093	2567136	64679	4.0	Woodman , Woodman , DON'T Spare THESE Trees	Jacques Demy has one hell of a sense of humor ; he took Anouk Aimee to California and signed up a team of Sequoias to play opposite her , in support of Gary Redwood ( oops , sorry , Lockwood ) . This has to set some kind of record for the most wooden screen acting EVER . By comparison Lola , the earlier Demy film featuring Aimee as the same character , was a masterpiece to rank alongside Citizen Kane . Actually Lola was a pretty good ' small ' movie and it's nigh on impossible to believe that Model Shop is the work of the same man . Aimee is , of course , a fine actress and was well established at the time she made Lola but here it's a case of one filet mignon and a handful of low-grade hamburgers . Don't waste your time .
409709	2567136	62893	4.0	So Is Vaudeville	This is one for the Accatone set , those pseuds petrified in the Nouvelle Vague who haunt the movie theatre just off Boul ' Mich sharing eternal spliffs and wondering why no one does Jump Cuts anymore . Michel Piccoli - alone on screen for over half the running time - does nothing all at once . Piccoli , who once starred in a REAL movie called The Things Of Life , contemplates the things of life on a conveyor belt that has been looped so we get the same things over and over but probably a centimetre away from where they were first second and third time around . For no apparent reason other than to make some sort of left-handed sense of the title , whilst rummaging in a closet he stumbles across a package that when untied turns out to be a gun wrapped in a newspaper that carries an account of John Herbert Dillinger , famously arrested in a movie theatre in Chicago . Piccoli strips the gun , oils and cleans it , reassembles it and shoots his sleeping wife . Why ? Why not . It's THAT kind of movie . Having done so he goes for a swim , as you do , climbs on board a private yacht where they are just burying the cook at sea . Spotting a vacancy he puts himself forward for the job , is given a trial , no questions asked and sails away . Arrested development Godard fans will LOVE this one whilst those who like REAL movies will give it a wide berth .
409784	2567136	373690	4.0	Which Witch ?	As is often the way if you try to be everything to everyone you wind up being nothing to no one . Assuming that we actually needed another take on this character - who , especially in France , has been as well documented on celluloid as Sherlock Holmes , Maigret , Raffles or even Tarzan - then we could have started with someone a tad more credible . Romain Duris is one of those actors ( Vincent Cassell and Benoit Magimal are others ) cursed or blessed depending on your point of view with a built-in insolent , arrogant expression that probably makes certain females roll over and play dead but makes me reach for the sick bag . The script does him no favours by jumping about like a Time Traveller and invoking echoes of The Maltese Falcon and The Da Vinci Code via a Masonic cum Knights of Templar outfit and crucifixes instead of black birds . On balance it's risible more than thrilling and / or scary which is the wrong response to this type of fare . As others have remarked here the viewer is constantly conscious of time passing non-fruitfully .
410017	2567136	92206	4.0	Tooty Flutey	It's well documented - not least by the man himself - that Michael Caine finds it hard to say ' no ' to any offer that comes in over the transom and as if to illustrate this an English Daily newspaper is giving away no less than 14 ' Best Of Breeds ' that today would go straight to DVD . The good news is that readers are obliged to collect the other 13 from applicable outlets , the bad news is that this , the first , was actually inserted in the newspaper in question . How bad is it ? Let me count the ways . Several English actors who should know better but clearly have bills to pay are wheeled out to go through the motions of what may be best described as a Cool rather than Cold War episode - thriller is far too grand a description - in which Nigel Havers gets too pushy for his own good , ' falls ' off a roof and leaves father Caine to get at any truth that might be floating around . Dire .
409520	2567136	47673	5.0	Snow Joke	Once again I appear to have watched a different film from the majority of posters making it a contest between the hard to please and the easily pleased . I watched it as I watch any and every movie i . e . with the best of intentions and hoping to like more than I dislike . On paper it had plenty going for it beginning with the score . Given that it's a Berlin score we know going in that 1 ) there will be a healthy slug of his back catalogue melded to a handful of new material and 2 ) that there's absolutely no danger of us mistaking it for Porter sophistication , Hart wit , Arlen verve and that schmaltz and sentiment will be the order of the day . That's fine . No one's trying to put anything over on us , we know it's going to be The Sound Of Music without the nuns and the kids so let's sit back and let it unspool . Crosby is usually a good bet and when he's teamed with Astaire he's an even better bet . Fred couldn't make it this time around so after trying everyone else they finally settled for Danny Kaye which would also be fine but not , of course , Slyvia Fine , with whose words and music he is most comfortable . It was probably asking too much to expect Kaye to play it straight so we keep getting the Kays schtick whether we like it or not . Rosemary Clooney is adequate as one of the female leads but Vera Ellen has never quite convinced as leading lady material and nor does she here . For acting we have Dean Jagger who is so good he tends to overbalance things . Pleasant ? Sure . Engaging ? Well . . . Painless ? More or less .
409973	2567136	197716	5.0	Room At The Bottom	This is , of course , an old warhorse so much so that the first film version dates back to 1912 . Marcel L'Herbier had a crack at it in 1930 and his version arguably eclipses those of Daquin and the most recent by Bruno Podalydes . This version , I fear , need trouble none of the others - though I haven't seen the Silent . Henri Aisner made only three films in nine years before slipping off the radar and if this is an example it's not difficult to see why . Whether he chose him or had him imposed by the front office his leading man , Serge Reggiani was just about as wrong as he could be and if that weren't bad enough Aisner relies on music to SUGGEST sinister goings on that never actually occur and it's not really enough to keep cutting to a master shot of the house in which lights go on like those on a Christmas tree . In sum there's nothing much wrong here that a little taste , style , class and or charm couldn't put right .
409054	2567136	287986	5.0	Kosher Nostra	Audrey Tautou was just beginning to happen when she made this movie ; she'd appeared in a good half dozen films of which the best by far was Tonie Marshall's Venus Beaute in which she got to play alongside Nathalie Baye , Mathilde Seigner and Micheline Presle where she couldn't help picking up some strong tips on technique . She made God is Great back to back with Amelie and , as luck would have it , Amelie was first out of the gate and the rest as they say . . . So what of this ; well , it's patchy , quirky and the director has an annoying habit of cutting to Black in the middle of a scene and sometimes coming back to it a few seconds later as if the film had run out and they couldn't afford another complete Take so they just carried on after they reloaded . Eccentric is a good word to describe it though I accept that some viewers will opt for charming . It's one of those where if you're in the right mood you'll respond but if you're not there's a chance it could irritate you .
409746	2567136	33627	5.0	You've Got To Draw The Line Somewhere	It's unbelievable that Pressburger won a Best Screenplay award for this although it was wartime I suppose and standards went out the window . Seen today it's a rambling , largely incoherent and unrealistic story of Six Nazis In Search Of A Neutral Country . The bizarre casting does little to help and it was clear that the actors with marquee value , Olivier , Massey , Howerd , were never On Call at the same time . Of these Olivier is by far the worst , an acting joke with an accent that would bring a blush to the cheek of Dick Van Dyke . Eric Portman as the Senior Nazi strikes his one note in frame # 1 and never deviates from or embellishes it throughout . It probably meant something to someone , somewhere back in 1941 but not to your jaded , cynical correspondent in 2008 .
410053	2567136	113273	5.0	Hi Lili Hi LOW	At university I was once obliged to reply in the form of an essay to the question ' Would Moby Dick be a better or worse book if the scientific sections were omitted ' . My reply was along the lines of ' If the scientific parts were omitted Moby Dick would be a shorter bad book ' and that's how I often feel about Rivette who seems incapable of shooting anything less than three hours - nothing wrong with that , witness Gone With The Wind - which is okay EXCEPT his ideas are usually worth no more than forty minutes . He exemplifies most of the things wrong with the New Wave , the abrupt cutting in the middle of a scene , characters appearing on the other side of town moments after walking out of frame , insufficient ' back story ' and / or information . A typical example in this film . Roland confronts Ninon in her apartment and accuses her of stealing a set of documents ( which we have in fact seen her do ) . She tells him to close his eyes , he obliges , she retrieves the documents from where she had hidden them , tells him to remain seated with his eyes closed and - wait for it - LEAVES the apartment , goes across town and gives the papers to Louise after which they go to a night club and dance . In the next shot Ninon enters her apartment Where , incredibly , Roland is STILL sitting with his eyes closed ; in real time this would have to be several hours but Rivette shoots it in such a way as to give the impression of just a few minutes . Okay , call this high Art if you will but Me , I call it SLOPPY film making . The film is full of such sloppiness ; it's billed as a Musical yet the first number occurs more than an hour into the story and such music as there is is banal in the extreme . The plot , or what passes for one , is our old friend the three disparate lives who somehow contrive to interweave ; the three leading actresses are certainly competent or even slightly better than competent as are the males but there are too many dead ends like the faux suicide club which amounts to little more than a twenty minute self-contained set piece inside a three hour movie and serves no discernible purpose . Ironically I thoroughly enjoyed Rivette's Va Savoir and there are certainly echoes of that movie here in the library scenes and the dormer window utilised by Jeanne Balibar in the latter . On balance this is one to be endured rather than enjoyed .
409977	2567136	22335	5.0	Leaving The Bad Girls For Good	This is an early talkie from William Wellman who went on to make some excellent movies like Battleground . It's an out-an-out and unashamed meller with not a lot of originality in the one about the hooker who lucks into a good man who's prepared to help her escape justice after she murders a ' trick ' . Being a seaman he is obliged to leave her on an island in which she is the only white woman which makes her the lust object for the other white men , outlaws to a man , already holed up there . One of them , the gaoler-cum-executioner , is especially taken with her and steals the mail the seaman is writing to her , letting her think she is abandoned . The guy she ' murdered ' in New Orleans turns up on the island leaving her free to return to New Orleans which doesn't sit well with the executioner , who ' lends ' her a gun ( which is against the law of the island ) , knowing she is almost sure to shoot the guy she already shot again . I could go on but I'm sure if I did you'd be ahead of me . For the time ( 1931 ) this was fair entertainment even with no durable actors .
409708	2567136	490166	5.0	Brighton Wreck	This is one they're going to love on the Festival circuit where apparently they find the chronicling of sleaze ' meaningful ' . With a title as lacking in imagination as London To Brighton there's not a great deal of point in looking for imagination in the film itself . The only possible target audience for this drek will be the lowlifes it celebrates , the pimps and prostitutes and perverts who take centre stage . This is exactly the kind of irresponsible crap that perpetuates the lifestyles it explores in such loving detail . Teenage thugs from sink estates hardly need lessons in how to be anti-social nor fledgling pimps lessons in how to pick up runaway girls sleeping rough and serve them up as the plate de jour for wealthy perverts . This is a film with no light , no virtue , no ' decent ' characters ; it's a film where people pay lip service to better natures : the vicious pimp who orders one of his ' girls ' to procure an eleven year old for the delectation of the old perv doesn't ' want ' to do it but 1 ) the order had been placed by a powerful man and 2 ) if he doesn't do it someone else will ; one step down the line the prostitute doesn't ' want ' to procure a young girl but she does albeit asking for more money from her pimp for doing so . The point NOT being made is that both the pimp and the prostitute have knowingly , by the way they have chosen to live their lives , put themselves in a position where they CAN be manipulated to do the morally dubious . There's nothing here we haven't seen before and nothing that won't be served up again , no doubt backed by more Lottery money . If sub-moronic hard men SHOUTING everything at the top of their voices and doling out casual violence to women and children is your thing then you'll love this but don't ask me to share your pleasure .
409031	2567136	52933	5.0	The Strain In Maine Is Mainly Due To Jane	On paper this must have seemed a pretty good bet , after all Little Man Takes On The Big Guys is always good for a premise so Little GAL takes on the Big Guys must be worth twice the money ; cast Doris Day as the little Gal and you're rounding third while the ball's still climbing and how about that new guy Lemmon to co-star . Jeez ! What a GREAT idea ; he made his movie DEBUT in It Should Happen To You so Lemmon in a movie with Happen ( ed ) in the title is a lead-pipe cinch . If only . Somehow there's just no chemistry between Day and Lemmon although both are fine individually and Ernie Kovacs is really OTT as the cut-out cartoon heavy who has a completely unrealistic volte face in the last reel . The idea of an ordinary housewife capturing the hearts of the public was sound enough for Day to repeat it much more successfully in The Thrill Of It All a few years later . This is just about up to one viewing but that's it .
409983	2567136	49602	5.0	All I Want For Christmas . . .	. . is not to have to watch Gilbert Becaud trying to play ONE role let alone two , and that's before he starts to sing . There were , of course , only two male singers of popular song in twentieth century France ; Yves Montand and all the rest and Montand could have acted Becaud off the screen with one gesture tied behind his back . That leaves Marcel Carne , a giant in French cinema and co-inventor , with seven-time colleague Jacques Prevert , of poetic realism . Alas , here he is a shadow of his former self and one wonders what he saw in this heavily diluted take on A Comedy Of Errors in the first place . On the plus side there are some pleasant visuals but that's about it .
409404	2567136	178764	5.0	Off-Key Pirandello	A man loses his memory whilst dressed in clothing totally unconnected to his everyday life . Now why does that sound familiar ? Oh , yes , Pirandello , Henry IV . Great play but this can't be it because there were no songs in Henry IV . What we have here is a road company Henry IV by a writer who wrote only one other screenplay more than twenty years later . This is the movie that really rang the bell for Tino Rossi , who'd been in films - all musicals - since the mid thirties . Of all the Continental films I've seen so far this , I guess , comes closest to meeting their manifesto which was to offer escapist entertainment . In a nutshell Rossi plays Jacques Martin , a popular singer who is appearing on stage in a piece of fluff called The Singing Vagabond and whilst in costume as a bum he suffers total amnesia , takes to the road and winds up on a barge with a pretty girl . Nature takes its course and things are looking good until someone recognizes him and he is returned to his other life . Not to worry though , this is escapist fodder turned out in the middle of the war so everything ends happily . Tino Rossi was something of a French Dick Powell , in other words a joke as a singer but where Powell redeemed himself by proving reasonably adept at dramatic acting and even directing Rossi remained a one-trick pony . This was one of five movies that Richard Pottier directed for Continental and the one that need detain us the least .
410012	2567136	81076	5.0	Sleazy Does It , Maurice	I used to think that Isabelle Huppert became interested in sleaze in the late 90s , around the time she made School Of Flesh but now I see that as far back as 1980 she was inserting a toe into murky waters . Watching this film you get the impression that Pialet has seen Tennesee Williams ' A Streetcar Named Desire and focused on Stanley Kowalski and Stella DuBois at the expense of Blanche and decided to speculate on how Stella , a genteel daughter of a plantation owner , hooked up with Stanley , a Polish lorry driver who has been walking erect only since Tuesday . So , presumably using this speculation as a starting point Pialet takes up his scissors and a piece of thin cardboard and fashions Nelly ( Huppert ) an educated , middle class bored woman and allows her path to cross that of LouLou ( Gerard Depardieu ) a guy about one and a half steps up from an ape , lately out of the slammer whose only interests in life are sex and violence . The result is predictable ; the moth is attracted to the flame . And that's it . No fresh insights into the Human Condition ; no polemics , no point of view , just a trawl through a garbage can for its own sake . As ever Huppert and Depardieu are excellent as is Guy Marchand , whom Huppert leaves for Depardieu but sometimes excellence is not enough .
409549	2567136	232083	5.0	Will The Real Mika Please Stand Up	Both Huppert and Chabrol are prolific and last year they worked together yet again on a movie light years ahead of this one but when one is prolific one is playing the percentages and winds up with a high chaff to wheat ratio as both have done here . Perhaps most risible is the scene towards the end that appears to be Chabrol's version of the heroine walking the corridors of the Gothic castle at three in the morning wearing only a negligee and armed only with a candle in the full knowledge that there are murderers , maniacs , vampires , perm any one from three , on the loose . Chabrol's take on this is to have a young girl volunteer to drive the car of her hostess along a winding road at night in the full knowledge that the hostess has drugged her drink . Realistically all she had to do was let the hostess , Huppert , drive herself to the pharmacy to collect a prescription , or even , if it comes to that , let the chauvinistic husband ( Dutronc ) pick up his own prescription . This is but one in a series of plot holes that may well be symbolised by the cobweb shawl Huppert is knitting throughout . Children swapped at birth ( well , it was good enough for Shakespeare , Chabrol may argue ) , one of them the child of a forensic lab owner with a boyfriend working there , so convenient for testing possible toxins the spider-woman may be lacing the drinks with . More ? How about this : confronted by a strange girl who claims she may be his daughter Dutronc goes from ' you must be mad ' to ' come and play a little four-hand piano with me ' in minutes . The colors are of that strangely muted type that Chabrol seems to have made his own , the two young actors clearly came in a flat-pack from IKEA and there's a lack of interaction throughout . Isabelle Huppert's Mika runs the gamut from cold-blooded murderess to charming hostess hitting all the stops along the way whilst Jacques Dutronc appropriately turns in a Johnny-One-Note performance . Not one that either Chabrol or Huppert would want to feature prominently on their CVs .
408757	2567136	53740	5.0	Hard Time	This is yet another example of a film that was probably impressive when released yet seems risible today . One really expects a little more class from Alun Owen and it's quite possible that the uncredited Jimmy Sangster contributed the lion's share of the Shooting Script given that it bears all the hallmarks of Hammer tat and Sangster and Hammer were made for each other . A lot of second-rate British actors turn in second rate performances here - for some reason neither Murray Melvin or Kenneth Cope are credited on the print I viewed and are probably thankful in retrospect whilst for reasons known only to themselves the producers saw fit to import a German actress , Margit Saad to walk through a gangster's moll role that Joan Collins could have phoned in - ironically Collins ' first husband , the dire Maxwell Reed has a small uncredited role . This is arguably the worst movie directed by Losey either in England or America , even The Sleeping Tiger leaves it dead in the water . Would-be hard man Stanley Baker weighs in with his usual would-be hard man performance and throws in a wayward accent that fits where it touches . If it's a choice between this or Carry On Cliché take the latter every time .
408820	2567136	56417	6.0	The Occidental Tourist ( s )	As swan songs go this could have used a decent cygneture tune . The best bit is right at the beginning when , continuing the tradition , Bing and Bob are seen as vaudevillians singing , dancing and pattering their way through ' Teamwork ' , with a lyric from Sammy Cahn , who had replaced Johnny Burke as Jimmy Van Heusen's permanent partner roughly a decade earlier . Plots were never a strong point in the franchise and this is , if anything , worse than most and for some unknown reason Peter Sellars is given several minutes in which to be wincingly embarrassing and utter some of the worst lines in the script . They also jettisoned Lamour as sex object but wisely allowed her a cameo appearance plus a ballad ; her replacement , Joan Collins , failed to register and the best one can say about this product of the famous Rank ' Charm ' School is that she clearly flunked charm . Following the opening vaudeville routine the plot continues in the way of the rest of the franchise with Bing conning Bob - here given Jimmy Van Heusen's real name , Chester Babcock , as an ' inside ' joke - into the usual life-threatening stunts and for good measure we even get a laundry list of previous near-misses including the squid , human cannonball , etc but then it runs out of steam and quickly spirals into complete preposterousness . The banter is still intact albeit a little frayed around the edges but they could have signed off with something a little better than this .
410028	2567136	68205	6.0	Shaw Thing	When Irwin Shaw wrote a short story called ' The Girls In Their Summer Dresses ' and placed it with the New Yorker he probably had no idea it would become one of the most anthologized American short story of the 20th century and would possibly inspire Eric Rohmer to take it as the starting point of the last of his Six Moral Tales . There was a lot of Shaw himself - who was married when he wrote it - in the main character , a reasonably happily married man possessed of an uncontrollable urge to look at other women even when out with his wife . Rohmer has created a similar affliction in Frederic ( Bernard Verley ) , equally happily married to Helene ( Francoise Verley ) , who is already the mother of his first child and bears him another during the course of the film . Rohmer takes Shaw's premise towards , if not actually to , its logical conclusion , by having Frederic concentrate on just One girl , Chloe ( Zouzou - this was the name of James Stewart and Donna Reed's daughter in Capra's ' It's A Wonderful Life ' and French directors being as they are , enamored of Hollywood , it's not impossible that Rohmer cast the actress merely because of her name ) . When we meet her first Choloe is very much the bohemian sporting bulky sweaters and jeans but as the film progresses she graduates to the kind of chic clothes that epitomize French women , girls in summer dresses indeed . Nothing , of course , happens . In this kind of film nothing ever does . Chloe is frank in her intention to seduce Frederic and he comes that close to succumbing but that's all , folks . This is the kind of movie it's tough to promote , its target audience is the habitué of the small salle , semi art house which still , thankfully , flourishes in Paris but forget UCI type chains .
409729	2567136	52644	6.0	Swishbuckler	This is , of course , a much-filmed story like Robin Hood etc and each generation will have its favourite version . In my case I found the best thing about it was the colour and I advise potential viewers to avoid travelling to the cinema by bus lest they drive a hole through the plot . Jean Marais is no Errol Flynn or even , nearer to home , Gerard Philippe , who made a memorable Fanfan La Tulipe and given Marais ' status as long-time lover of Jean Cocteau it may not be inappropriate to describe him as a swishbuckler . Bourvil is on hand to provide comic relief but the best you can give this is that it passes the time more or less painlessly .
408748	2567136	43744	6.0	The Bland Leading The Bland	This is a bit of a rum do and no mistake . For a start we have the solid mahogany Richard Todd leaving a trail of sawdust in his wake whilst Zachary Scott who can and does act Todd off the screen doesn't even appear until about reel # 6 and is woefully under extended . Ruth Roman might have done really well as the femme lead - if she wasn't in the same movie as Mercedes McCambridge - things are tough all over , it would seem . Plot-wise it's as hokey as they come ; we open with Todd on Death Row on account of a little matter of murdering his wife then , with no groundwork / back-story to help us he is awarded first a stay of execution and then a re-trial which leaves him a free man . Enter Ruth Roman , actress on vacation / convalescence who falls instantly into fascination with Todd . This leads nicely to the ' doubting ' scene , did he REALLY do it , will he do the same to Me , until all is resolved neatly with the real killer not only being unmasked but also paying the ultimate price . This is noir-lite with two excellent performances from Scott and McCambridge , a solid one from Roman and Todd having a laugh .
410091	2567136	95250	6.0	Don't Luc Now . . .	. . . but it's been done before . On the other hand what hasn't but so many posters seem to regard this as totally original that I have to question whether they are real movie buffs or maybe just like underwater stuff . It's not necessary to have actually SEEN every film ever made or even say a Tenth of all the films ever made but serious movie buffs should be AWARE of what has gone before and I refuse to believe that I'm the only person who has ever HEARD of if not actually seen ' Beyond The 12-Mile Reef , a Fox entry from the early fifties with a fairly starry cast-list for the time ; Robert Wagner , then just establishing himself as a handsome hunk if not actually an actor , played a young Greek conch fisherman who spent his days diving with his father , Gilbert Roland , for conches ( sponges ) and as the supply dwindled obliged to move into the much deeper waters of the title . Richard Boone was on hand as a rival fisherman with a comely daughter , Tery Moore , engaged to Peter Graves ( shortly before he appeared as the German ' plant ' in Billy Wilder's Stalag 17 ) until Wagner comes on the scene . As if that line up weren't enough J . Carroll Naish was along for the ride to steal every scene that wasn't nailed down and let's not forget Wagner's Greek mother who does a lot of cooking . Luc Besson has taken this plot and refined it slightly ; it's still about diving to great depths and there's still an attractive woman to complicate things although Besson is not completely without shame and dispenses with the rivalry between divers Jean Reno and Jean-Marc Barr almost as soon as it manifests itself . It has a tendency to be episodic rather than continuous and there are too many non sequiters - we have , for example , to imagine how Barr got to Peru and from there to Taormina and not worry too much about stealing a dolphin and releasing it into the sea . It's always good to see Jean Reno and it was interesting to catch Sergio Castellitto in an early performance but that's about it .
409761	2567136	41640	6.0	Mr Bland Builds His Dreams	A previous poster said it all and succinctly ; Carne sans Prevert is like Rodgers without Hart . Of course no film that stars Jean Gabin , features Louis Seigner ( grandfather of Emmanuelle and Mathilde ) and is directed by Marcel Carne could ever be totally bad it's just that the potential for greatness has been missed . Another poster made the pertinent remark that when Georges Simenon abandons the subject of murder / crime his books - and by extension the films made from them - tend to be duller . What we have here is a protagonist ( Gabin ) around fifty or so , owner of a bar / restaurant / club and a cinema and an eye for the ladies . As is to be expected Carne frames his shots in an interesting way and the black and white photography makes for some reasonable light-and-shadow effects but there's not a lot more than that on offer .
409978	2567136	52357	6.0	Falling In Love Again	It's a proved fact that if something is repeated enough times the susceptible person will eventually accept it as fact . Not everyone is susceptible to manipulation and so it is that I find myself at odds with two things that I have heard - and seen on the printed page - repeated for most of my life , 1 ) Alfred Hitchcock is a ' master ' and 2 ) Vertigo is a classic . So far as the first statement goes I've watched enough of Hitchcock's films to judge him a reasonably competent filmmaker but certainly no more gifted than , say , Howard Hawks , George Cukor , Henry Hathaway etc . On the other hand I have no problem accepting that Billy Wilder and Orson Welles are both ' masters ' . I've now seen Vertigo twice over a period of five or six years and I still can't see what all the fuss is about . For one thing it's riddled with flaws . Hitchcock needs to establish that James Steward has a problem with heights so he has Stewart , a plain-clothes detective working out of Frisco , and a uniformed cop , chase a suspect across some rooftops . The suspect leaps between two buildings , the uniformed cop follows , Stewart is last and fails to gain a foothold on the adjacent roof ; he slips down the mansard roof and is left clinging to a gutter that is giving under his weight ; the uniform cop abandons the chase , allowing the suspect to get away , and attempts to haul Stewart up to safety but falls to his own death . Stewart is now hanging from a rapidly weakening gutter with no hand or footholds available and not a soul to help . Clearly in 30 seconds , 60 tops , he is bound to fall to his own death . Clearly we can't have this so Hitch just cuts the scene and Fades In several months later when we discover Stewart in the apartment of a friend , Barbara Bel Geddes , complete with cane and corset and now , he tells Geddes ( us the viewer ) retired from the police force . He's then contacted by an acquaintance he hasn't seen since college who has since married into money and is running a large family business on behalf of his wife . He interviews Stewart in his large , well-appointed office and voices his concerns about his wife's strange behaviour , asking Stewart , as a favor , to follow her . I don't know about you but I have been in the offices of several successful businessmen and in 99 per cent of cases their offices boast a picture of their wives and / or children if they are married . Not this kiddie . He tells Stewart he will be dining with his wife later that evening and suggests Stewart be in the restaurant to get a look at his wife . Detective Stewart never thinks to ascertain that it IS his wife or to see a picture or any kind of proof that the woman in the restaurant , Kim Novak , really is the guy's wife . For a society woman Novak cannot come up with one single friend and spends her days totally alone and seemingly obsessed with a long-dead relative . Stewart follows her to a hotel , sees her at the window of her room there , braces the owner , who takes him up to what is now an empty room . Again no explanation of how or where she disappeared to . Eventually Stewart falls for her , she insists on visiting a mission outside Frisco , climbs the bell tower and seemingly Brodies . Verdict : Accidental death . Some months later Stewart sees her ' double ' in the street and falls in love all over again . At this point Hitchcock makes us privvy to the scam . When she led him to the bell-tower the guy who hired Stewart was waiting at the top where he threw his REAL wife off the edge . He had merely hired Novak to pose as his wife ( she did something similar in Wilder's Kiss Me , Stupid , when she posed as the wife of Ray Walston ) . Here we encounter the second ' problem ' . A woman goes off a bell tower and soon the place is crawling with cops so how come no one noticed a man and a woman , one the husband of the dead woman the other his supposed wife , sneaking away . If you can buy these pathetic plot points then chances are you will think this is something more than a competent meller . Me , I'm going to check out The Apartment , Ace In The Hole , Sunset Boulevard again , see how the Big Boys do it .
409545	2567136	30202	6.0	Three-Quarter Tome	As a great admirer of Julien Duvivier and now , at last , having seen The Great Waltz some 60 plus years after it was made I can't help wishing that Duvuvuer had been tempted to Hollywood by something a little more substantial . I don't , of course , know the circumstances but given the horror stories about Hollywood moguls that we were weaned on it's not difficult to imagine a discussion in which the reasoning is ' we're doing a movie about an Austrian waltz king set in Vienna and up to here in schmaltz so why don't we get that French guy who did those things about tough guys in Africa ( La Bandera , Pepe Le Moko ) and the Popular Front ( La Belle Equipe ) . Great idea , boss , let's get a cable off toot sweet . I wasn't there at the time but with hindsight it's ludicrous that Duvivier followed his masterpiece ( just one of his masterpieces actually ) Un Carnet du bal with this dross although there is a kind of left-handed logic given that Un Carnet du bal concerned a woman's treasured memories of her first ball where the prevailing mood would have been three-quarter time . Sixty-odd years later trying to look past the wooden Gravet and the ' stage ' Austrian accents ( ah , Shhsstrrowss ) personified by Sig Ruman in the opening scene we're able to salvage the sure-footed direction and directorial touches of Duvivier and see what today looks hokey - the ride in the Vienna woods in which every sound is a musical note contributing to the instant composition Tales Of The Vienna Woods - as the magical sequence it must have seemed to a world hungry for escapism with a major conflict waiting in the wings . Likewise the quicksilver crochets and quavers that dance over an inept bank clerk's ledger in the opening scene - indeed the economy which in that same scene delineates Strauss as a frustrated musician trapped in a world of finance . Known to me more as the wife of another great writer , Clifford Odets , than an actress , Luise Rainer has little to do in the emoting stakes but Duvivier does use her effectively in the scene at the Opera House when he shows us how insignificant is a mere wife against ART , personified in this case by the mighty Opera House , the performers and , of course , Composers . I'm glad I saw it - and indeed now own it thanks to a generous French friend , but I'll be watching both Un Carnet du bal and the film Duvivier made immediately after The Great Waltz , La Fin du jour , much more than returning to this .
409745	2567136	58283	6.0	Little Boxes	One of the hallmarks of a superior screenplay is the way it deals with ' awkward ' questions whilst one of the hallmarks of a good movie is that ' awkward ' questions don't begin to raise their quizzical heads until long after you reach home . So : Having established in the first minute of screen time that Olivia de Havilland is perfectly able to walk , albeit slowly , with the aid of a walking stick and further established inside another minute - via an exchange of dialogue with her son , about to leave her alone in the house for several days - that she will be able to dispense with the walking stick in just a few weeks , why , we wonder , has she seen fit to install an elevator that would not be out of place in a four-star hotel , in a modest-sized house in which the only stairs on view are straight and number no more than twenty treads at the outside . Why not install a stairlift ? Okay , let that one go for a moment ; after eleven minutes screen time the power fails leaving her suspended some six or seven feet above the ground . Eventually she presses the alarm button which rings , not , as we might suppose , in the local police station / doctor's surgery etc but in an alley at the side of the house which depends on 1 ) someone passing by at the exact time the alarm sounds and 2 ) no noise from traffic on the large highway that runs in front of the house . Okay , let THAT one go , too . When a passing wino ( Jeff Corey ) stumbles into the kitchen deHavilland , who can't see who it is , launches into what SHE thinks is logical exposition : A few months ago she broke her hip and had the elevator installed until it mended . This is where it falls down . To design , build and install such an elevator would take about three times as long as it would for the hip to heal so immediately the whole premise is out the window . When you're thinking this whilst WATCHING the film you know they're in trouble . Having said that it's certainly watchable ; deHavilland , clearly anxious to put Melanie Wilks behind her , reveals a backbone ( if not a hipbone ) and Corey and Ann Sothern turn in fine support . Worth a look .
408758	2567136	432264	6.0	The Dwight Stuff	This snuck into London this week virtually unheralded and playing at only one cinema . By chance I stumbled on a paragraph that mentioned the star was Brenda Blethyn so on that basis I checked it out . It's yet another of those ' indie ' productions that is fine to see once but probably won't stand repeat viewings . Blethyn plays a stand-up comedian who apparently made a minor name for herself in seventies Britain prior to emigrating and is now trying to reestablish herself in Sydney . For good measure she is divorced - from a Country singer who moonlights as a Security Guard , just as Blethyn moonlights as a canteen worker - and struggling to retain control of her two sons , one of whom is brain-damaged and the other a virgin . One of the problems is that the film can't decide whether to concentrate on Blethyn's attempts to make a living on the club scene , though the material that we actually hear - incredibly and unbelievably credited to Jo Brand - makes this highly unlikely , or the burgeoning love affair between the non brain-damaged son and a new girlfriend , played well by Emma Booth . Basically this one has ' feelgood ' written all over it and it that's what you like then you'll like Clubland aka Introducing The Dwights .
410288	2567136	53690	6.0	Oh ! Mr . Porter . . . .	. . . what have they done to your wonderful Broadway show ? Answer ; about what you'd expect from a Hollywood that had a congenital aversion to transposing Broadway musicals to the screen untampered with so that , for example , a family from Oshkosh , Wisconsin , who went to NY on vacation and saw , for example , The Pajama Game , on Broadway could return home secure in the knowledge that the movie version they saw at their local movie theatre a couple of years later would NOT be the show they saw on Broadway . Frank Sinatra appeared in Five movie versions of Broadway musicals during his career and NONE of them was wholly satisfactory , mostly because of meaningless tampering . Higher and Higher , for example , retained only ONE number from the Rodgers and Hart Broadway show and that one , Disgustingly Rich , was a minor number ; on the other hand the film did give Sinatra two ' hits ' in A Lovely Way To Spend An Evening and I Couldn't Sleep A Wink Last Night . On The Town also jettisoned a sizable portion of the Broadway score , including Lonely Town , and added stuff that was one step above total garbage . Guys and Dolls was by far the most faithful to the Broadway original but even then they jettisoned the ' big ' ballad , I've Never Been In Love Before ( as well as A Bushel And A Peck ) but they DID prevail on the original composer , Frank Loesser , to supply new material ( Adelaide , A Woman In Love ) ; Pal Joey suffered a bad case of both jettisoning and interpolating disparate songs by the same writers ( Rodgers and Hart ) so that Happy Hunting Horn , Do It The Hard Way , In Our Little Den Of Iniquity , What Is A Man , Plant You Now , Dig You Later , all went out the window and were replaced - if that's the word - by There's A Small Hotel , I Didn't Know What Time It Was , My Funny Valentine and The Lady Is A Tramp . Which brings us to Can-Can . Cole Porter went to great pains to replicate the Sound of Parisian Music Hall circa 1890 - a fact I mentioned in my review of the execrable Moulin Rouge , which made absolutely NO concession to its time frame - so it is ironic that Fox elected to discard such Porter gems as Allez-vous en , I Am In Love , Never Give Anything Away , Ev'ry Man Is A Stupid Man , Never , Never Be An Artist , all of which had the FEEL of the period , in favour of You Do Something To Me , Just One Of Those Things , Let's Do It , which are totally out of place in the context of the story and time . They also ' created ' a part for Sinatra that didn't exist in the show and he was allowed to PLAY the Sinatra for which he is best known , hip , cool , ring-a-ding ding ( at one point Louis Jourdan even SAYS ring-a-ding ding - in 1896 , yet - when describing the Sinatra character to Shirley MacLaine ) . I write as a lifetime admirer of both Sinatra AND Cole Porter so I was doubly disappointed with this travesty . Ironically the BEST Screen musical in which Sinatra ever appeared was High Society , also the work of Cole Porter and DOUBLY ironically it was so successful that it became s Stage musical with - you've guessed it - several EXTRA Porter numbers interpolated . Can-Can had the potential to be an outstanding film musical instead it is little more than mediocre .
409631	2567136	49055	6.0	Swings And Roundabouts	This is possibly the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical I like best or , to put it another way , the one I dislike least . When it comes to Rodgers and Hart versus Rodgers and Hammerstein it Larry Hart , no contest , as far as I'm concerned . There's no question that Rodgers was directly affected by his lyricists , with Larry he was sassy , bright and had balls , with Oscar he trades all those for a more lyrical quality that was also portentous . Film-wise it doesn't help that Sinatra walked after a couple of days shooting thus opening the way for the bland , insipid Gordon McCrea , who , it must be said , does give it the old college try but Soliloquy had been in Sinatra's repertoire since the show opened on Broadway and he recorded it twice , once for Columbia in the forties and again for Reprise in the 60s so right from the off McCrae was on a hiding to nothing . Other negatives are the missing numbers - You're A Queer One , Julie Jordan etc but there are positives ; although there is a healthy amount of sentiment it's not quite as schmaltzy as it might have been and there are detachable songs - both If I Loved You and When The Children Are Asleep , for instance , could be sung by any shy lovers and any young parents - and they get the best out of production numbers like June Is Bustin ' Out All Over and This Was A Real Nice Clambake . Overall it's pleasant and enjoyable but Oh , What It Could Have Been .
409316	2567136	73453	6.0	Chess Pie	Asked by his wife , Susan Clark , if he'd like to take in an Eric Rohmer movie ( Ma Nuit chez Maud ) , Harry Moseby , Gene Hackman , replies , ' I saw a Rohmer movie once , it was like watching paint dry ' . This observation by writer Alan Sharp is , of course , right on the money , but Sharp's own movie ( this one ) is like watching an ' action ' painter at work ; first ; place a canvas on the floor , second ; throw a pot of paint at it , letting the paint fall where it will and create whatever random patterns , or none at all , it has a mind to . This is one of those movies that keep academics who ' teach ' film in jobs ; deliberately vague , deliberately open to any and every interpretation you want to impose upon it ; a sterile intellectual mind game masquerading as a private eye movie , or a private eye movie with ideas above its station . You tell me , I wouldn't know a diegetic from a mimetic , if I stump it up at the box office I just want to be entertained and / or diverted for a couple of hours not watch a movie whilst simultaneously taking a Mensa entrance exam . The acting is adequate all round , the plot is as simple as Einstein's Theory of Relativity and about as engrossing . Boy ! am I gonna be popular in Pseud's Corner .
409246	2567136	469494	6.0	Oil Be Dammned	This is the first time I've seen Daniel Day Lewis on screen ; usually he appears in films that are hyped to death and it doesn't help that one of these , Gangs Of New York , teamed him with Scorcese , another pseud's favourite and equally over-hyped as an individual . I can't say I fell asleep or didn't enjoy it but neither am I available for dancing in the street , to paraphrase Sandy Woollcott . It was well made , indubitably and well acted but it is just a movie , Ingrid . The date of the source novel , Oil , by Upton Sinclair , was contemporaneous with McTeague , filmed famously by Erich Von Stroheim as Greed and when we throw in James Dean's Jett Rink in Giant we remember once again that nobody writes in a vacuum , be it novel or screenplay . See it , by all means , but don't lose your head .
409183	2567136	51378	6.0	When Irish Eyes Are Smiling . . .	. . . it's twelve to seven the eyes in question belong to William Irish , aka Cornell Woollrich and the smile will be ironic because this plot is PURE Woollrich / Irish - in fact Moreau starred in a GENUINE Irish plot some years later , The Bride Wore Black . If you like serendipitous coincidence then this will be right down your rue ; Julien and his bosse's wife are an item and conspire to kill said boss and make it look like suicide . The plot goes like clockwork til , having left the building for the weekend Julien ( Maurice Ronet ) gets in his car , starts the engine then spots a glaring clue he omitted to take care of . Leaving the engine running he goes back to the building , gets in the elevator only to have it switched off by the janitor , who's leaving for the weekend . Trapped in the elevator Julien has no idea that a tearaway , Louis , and his girlfriend , Veronique , have ' borrowed ' the car and will subsequently kill two German tourists in a motel , using Julien's gun - conveniently left in the car . Meanwhile Moreau spots Veronique in the car but , not seeing Louis behind the wheel , assumes Julien is stepping out on her . When the janitor turns on the elevator so that the police can search Julien's office , he seizes his chance to escape not realizing he is wanted for a double murder of which he is completely innocent . Nice plot , nice atmos , nice score a la Miles Davis . Improbable , okay , but entertaining with it .
408793	2567136	45591	7.0	Past The Dead Wood Stage	This must have been like a breath of fresh air in 1953 . There hadn't been an ' Original ' screen musical for several years , instead there had been several ' bio-pics ' of composers / performers and Day had even featured in one ( I'll See You In My Dreams , the biopic of lyricist Gus Kahn ) herself . So this Annie Get Your Gun-lite ( a love-hate relationship between two sharp-shooters , ' challenge ' duet ( Anything You Can Do , I Can Do Without You ) pushed all the right buttons . If you're prepared to suspend disbelief and respond to a fine score then you'll enjoy this one . Allyn McLerie shows what she might have been had things turned out differently and her Broadway background showed - she was , for a time , married to Adolph Green , and appeared in several shows including Where's Charley - and makes a fine second lead . Howard Keel points up the links to Annie Get Your Gun and apart from bursting into Higher Than A Hawk for no discernible reason , proves a decent enough foil for Day . Sammy Fain was an excellent composer though the Oscar-winning Secret Love is much inferior to his earlier I'll Be Seeing You , from a Revue , Right This Way , in 1938 . Overall all this is a pleasant romp .
409136	2567136	95511	7.0	Reader , I Dazzled Him	There's more than a little touch of Pirandello in the night about this entry in which a young woman , Constance , is not only reading a book entitled The Reader , to her husband in bed but also projects herself on to the eponymous character , Marie , and acts out either her own ( Constance ) fantasies or those of the fictional Marie or a combination of both . Given the task of carrying the film Miou-Miou is more than up to it and freshness is added by both the location , Arles , albeit little more than the picturesque narrow streets traversed by Marie between gigs , and the supporting cast , relatively unknown outside France though certainly well respected - especially Brigitte Catillon and Patrick Chesnais - within it . It's unquestionably a film that will divide opinion between those who will surrender to its whimsy , offbeat charm and dialogue and those who will denounce it as soft-porn with a press agent . As for me , I love Brigitte Catillon in anything .
409242	2567136	1105739	7.0	Weirds And Music	There seems to be a current vogue in French cinema for adding songs to what otherwise would be non-musical films . Faubourg 36 has some sort of excuse inasmuch as it is centred on a Music Hall but Agathe Clery and this one would have worked quite as well as straight films . Of the two this , a tale of espionage , is the least likely candidate but they attempt to justify the songs by having virtually all the principals taking singing lessons with the same tutor ; clearly writer-director Ilan Duran Cohen figured he'd been switched as an infant and his real name was Ilan Duran Duran . If the plot is silly to tedious the playing is mostly top drawer especially where Marina Fois and Jeanne Balibar are concerned . Though I saw it with a capacity audience no one has seen fit to comment . Weird .
408985	2567136	37449	7.0	Forward March	This was one of several freebies in a newspaper with the catch-all title ' War Films ' ( Tunes Of Glory takes place entirely in peacetime , A Matter Of Life And Death is only peripherally concerned with war ) and I put off watching it based on a vague feeling it would turn out to be jingoistic crap . Having watched it at last I've been disabused of that prejudice ; formulaic it may be ( it follows the tried and true formula of introducing a group of conscripts at a train station and remaining with them through basic training until they wind up in North Africa pitted against Rommel's panzers . In other words it's our old friends the Hollywood bomber crew with English accents . Peter Ustinov had a hand in the script and also takes part as a sort of cut-rate Akim Tamiroff in Five Graves To Cairo and acquits himself as well as any in the fine cast . David Niven fails to steal it as the one ' name ' on view and gives basically an unselfish performance allowing the likes of Stanley Holloway and Leslie Dwyer to polish their lovable cockney sparrer images . Carol Reed handles it well and it stands up remarkably well .
408809	2567136	459880	7.0	If You Go Down In The Woods Today	I suppose I should begin by stating that I've never read the novel nor seen any of the previous adaptations ; a girl I know in Paris has been recommending it since it was released long before it picked up Cesars for Best Actress , Film and Writing this year . Though I haven't read or seen it previously I knew , or thought I did , the main thrust - sorry about that - i . e . rough sex between a macho ill-educated man and a sexually frustrated aristocrat saddled with an impotent husband > How wrong can you be ; what we get here is a romantic and , dare I say it , Tender love story which may account why the audience with whom I saw it comprised twelve assorted and unaccompanied females between 20 and 60 and one couple . If you asked me to nominate an actress alive or dead who can do both aristocrat and sensual I'd think in terms of Ava Gardener , Sophia Loren , Fanny Ardant , Ingrid Bergman , etc and not , say , Audrey Hepburn , but I'd be wrong because Marina Hands is outstanding in the eponymous role and looks younger than her thirty years . Of course she IS the daughter of Ludmila Mikael which explains a lot ; the female director has followed convention inasmuch as the first time Constance sees her lover to be she is wearing a skirt that stops just short of her ankles , a coat , scarf , gloves and a hat in other words the only naked flesh on display is her face and true to form her first reaction to a man naked from the waist up , is to recoil in embarrassment though she soon gets over it . With two hours forty minutes to play with the director takes her time getting to the nitty gritty so that it's just short of the hour when they first make love . There's lots of detail , atmosphere as we get to know Constance who comes across as virginal and we suspect that if the marriage WAS consummated before her husband received the wound that rendered him impotent it was not very satisfactory . Another surprise is the gamekeeper - now given a name other than the Mellors of the novel , who , far from being a crude , macho love em and leave em macho type is actually sensitive and comes to love Constance . There IS sex , of course , but strange as it may seem it is almost chaste and would almost , but not quite , be at home in a Doris Day movie from the fifties . As I write Marina Hands has accepted an invitation to join the elite Comedy Francaise , an honour she fully deserves .
408747	2567136	41368	7.0	Barbara Nails Thelma	This was probably the tail end of the first great Noir cycle but even if it does tend to flag a little it's still worth anyone's time . Stanwyck is on best scenery-chewing form and Paul Kelly is fine in a lower-billed role . Wendell Corey was , of course , prime lumber and wisely Siodmak doesn't give him anything difficult to do - like acting . The Stanwyck role is a first cousin to the one she played so brilliantly in Double Indemnity i . e . a femme fatale who uses her wiles on some poor sap who is a necessary means to her end whilst all the while there is another guy in the background . Siodmak was no slouch at noir or film-making in general and his professionalism keeps you watching to the bitter end . Definitely worth a look .
409077	2567136	154174	7.0	Baudu Drowning	Alfred Greven , the honcho of the German-run Continental Films during the Occupation , was a man of parts . He thought nothing of employing blackmail to ' perusade ' both Edwige Feuillere and Danielle Darrieux to work for his outfit and when Darrieux called a halt after three films he saw to it that she didn't work again until well after the war . With this one he seems to take a delight in pointing out to the French public that Germans didn't have a monopoly on ruthlessness and that the protagonist of Au Bonheur des dames , Mouret ( Albert Prejean ) would make a pretty good Nazi himself . Of course Greven was only putting on celluloid what Emile Zola had put on paper in the previous century - and which Julien Duvivier had already filmed at the dawn of the Sound Era with the exquisite Dita Parlo - but nevertheless he probably derived great satisfaction from chronicling the rise of one shopkeeper ( Prejean ) at the expense of another Baudu ( Michel Simon ) . Zola is thought to have based his emporium Au Bonheur des dames on Bon Marche , the oldest and still one of the most elegant of Parisienne Department Stores and just as Bonheur swallows up its neighbour La Viel Elbeuf so Bon Marche was eventually eclipsed by Galleries Lafeyette and Printemps . Michel Simon dominates every scene in which he appears as does Suzy Prim whilst Albert Prejean who SHOULD dominate does so only in terms of the storyline . Ultimately this falls into the top half of the Continental output and is well worth seeking out .
409723	2567136	455078	7.0	That Old Gang Of Mine	I chose to see this on the strength of Diane Kurys and Michelle Laroque or vice versa so the rest was something of a bonus . There's nothing new in the premise which is little more than Class Reunion time with added spin . Essentially one brother writes a book in which he is critical of his ' Mr TV ' type brother , who specialises in Reality shows . Irked by this the ' wronged ' brother ( Lambert Wilson ) invites bad brother plus a bunch of old friends and colleagues to his second home in Marrakesh , a convenient 45th birthday falling at just the right time . Naturally old sores are picked to reveal festering wounds before they once more go their separate ways . The satire doesn't quite come off but there are some nice moments and Laroque has the has-been actress down pat . I'd hesitate to describe it as essential viewing but neither will you be entirely wasting your time .
409712	2567136	45525	7.0	I Blame The Parents . .	. . . and so does Cayette . On the other hand Cayette spent virtually all his career blaming somebody . It's a sobering thought that Ken Loach probably hero-worshipped Cayette and almost certainly saw him as a role model . There is , thankfully , one large difference between guru and disciple and that is that unlike Loach Cayette doesn't forget to add a top layer to his diatribes in the shape of Entertainment . He actually provides a storyline that CAN , if one is so inclined , be viewed merely as drama , the Social Comment is there all right but unlike Loach it's not in yer face so if , for example , you want to view this film as nothing more than the tale of a group of youngsters who feel alienated and / or dispossessed and embark on a naive scheme to bankroll a trip to their idea of paradise then do that . These kids are in their mid teens so that in 1954 they'd lived through most of WW2 and the period of austerity that followed ; the Cold War is well underway as is Korea so little wonder they dream of tropical islands if only they had some serious money . We know because we've seen movies like The Asphalt Jungle - and will see it's successor The Killing in a couple of years - that even robberies that are planned meticulously over months and to the last detail have a way of unravelling if only because Crime could not be SEEN to pay in those halcyon days so what chance a scheme based on I'll cosy up to this rich guy , accept an invitation to his apartment and THEN , while his back's turned I'll leave the french window unlocked so that YOU can get in and take anything portable that we can sell . Oh , yes , should you be disturbed in the middle of this , by a cop , for example , you're on your own . Exactly . Which is , of course , what happens . Cayette , who was not averse to dealing with such emotive subjects as euthanasia starts by framing the parents in the courtroom as if it is them and not the kids who are on trial and he allows each one a flashback to reinforce the culpability . Overall it's a fine film with a cast largely unknown outside France with the exception of Bernard Blier and certainly has value as an example of domestic cinema in the early fifties .
408835	2567136	440963	7.0	Cut To The Chase	' Action ' barely rate even a blip on my personal radar but this one enjoyed a fairly universal fine critical response so when I found myself in another city and checked out the sole multiplex this was the only game in town , making it that or the nearest bar . I can see where the critics were coming from and I guess that as ' action ' movies go this one certainly delivers but whilst it entertained it failed to engross me to the extent that I did NOT question as it was unspooling rather than later just HOW Bourne was able to travel so easily and quickly from country to country with - presumably - no passport and little or no money . In a similar way I queried the ' cheating ' in the way that director Greengrass shot certain episodes , usually those involving high speed chases / fights etc so that , with the best will in the world , it is impossible to know just WHAT is happening ; in other words we are unable to follow a given person and / or vehicle from A to Z and trace the trajectory . What we get is something like A to about F then it turns into alphabet soup before stabilizingng round about X , Y or Z . Call me old fashioned but I call this SLOPPY film making from a director clearly convinced that the popcorn brigade won't CARE about logic and continuity just so long as the crashes keep coming . Apart from these cavils it was a pleasant enough time-passer .
410256	2567136	69281	7.0	Not So Fast , Inspector	As it turned out this was Mank's last film and that makes it fitting that it is the best of his ' late ' work - There Was A Crooked Man , The Honey Pot , Cleopatra etc . He was , of course , working with playwright Anthony Shaffer who adapted his own highly successful play for the screen - one of the few times Mank failed to take a writer-director credit since turning hyphenate in the nineteen forties . Okay , so Olivier is as mannered as always and Caine still a tad green , these things are easy to overlook because of the quality of the writing , the ' feel ' of a house given over to game-playing and the several twists in the plot . Not perhaps up there with Letter To Three Wives , All About Eve etc but only a whisker behind .
409378	2567136	31507	7.0	Power To The People	The day after the latest cinematic retelling of the Jesse James story opened in London - and is , by all accounts , a fairly turgid affair - the BBC screened this popular version from 1939 , shot in the old three-strip Technicolor and starring Tyrone power and a cast of Hollywood stalwarts - Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell would play mother and son again the following year in The Grapes Of Wrath , Donald Meek appeared in Stagecoach ( another John Ford film ) the same year , whilst the likes of Henry Hull and Randolph Scott made up the numbers . My own knowledge of the facts is too scanty for me to comment yeah or nay on a screenplay which paints the James brothers as home-steaders minding their own business until a nasty villain in the shape of Brian Donlevy tries to con them out of their land - as he has done to several of their neighbors - which is needed for the railroad , and inadvertently kills their mother . Naturally such behaviour is enough to send any God-fearing farmer to the edge so all those trains subsequently robbed by the brothers are just their way of getting even . It's probably fair to say that in 1939 no one was analysing these things too closely and provided a film delivered a fair slice of entertainment audiences were happy . This still delivers entertainment if you think of the standards of the time ; Power is a great hero and he plays with passion and zeal , his cause is seen to be just and he really was a hero to the people . Judged by its own lights this is a fine movie .
409094	2567136	298126	7.0	Oh , I DO Like To Be Beside The Seaside	This is another charmer . The great thing about France is that filmmakers are allowed to make ' small ' films like this without being penalized . In the same year ( 2002 ) for example Le Chignon d'Olga was also released and between them both films racked up something like 100 , 000 admissions but nobody yelled , no heads rolled , in fact Julie Lopes-Curval who directed Bord de mer went on to write La role de sa vie which co-screenwriter of Bord de mer , Francois Favrat , directed and with Agnes Jaoui and Karin Viard co-starring ' Role ' was a much more high-profile project . Not a lot happens in Bord de mer . If you want an analogy it's something like Walden if Thoreau had been part of a community . It's just a record of a year in a small seaside town which is virtually almost always out-of-season even in the summer because the only visitors are regulars , most of whom own property rather than staying in hotels / pensions . It's a company town to the extent that a small family company ' mine ' the sea for stones which are then ' sorted ' by the locals and used to manufacture anything that CAN be manufactured from pebbles . We follow a handful of people , the best known being Bulle Ogier and Ludmilla Mikhael , ex-Comedy Francaise as they are , in the immortal words of Johnny Burke , busy doing nothing . The film is shot in lovely , not to say restful , pastels and a second viewing some two years later was just as enjoyable as the initial one .
409154	2567136	84843	7.0	Strike Up The Bland	Despite a reasonably varied output Jacques Demy is destined to be remembered by film buffs as the onlie begetter of The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and by admirers of Cole Porter , Larry Hart , Frank Loesser , Johnny Mercer etc as the William MacGonigall of lyricists , indeed Demy established something of a record in the number of banal lyrics he has committed to celluloid . Defenders will argue that in creating ' sung-through ' musicals he was not looking for extractable hit songs ( though in English translations two did emerge from Cherbourg ) . That first musical was bittersweet albeit brightly lit whereas this last entry is much more dark as reflected in the sombre reds and blues . Set against a strike it all ends in tears but along the way Danielle Darrieux , and Richard Berry weigh in with some fine work . Definitely watchable .
409339	2567136	22611	7.0	It's In The Bag	This was the first of several collaborations between Jacques Prevert and his kid brother Pierre . Prevert senior wrote two other screenplays that same year but it was junior's first At Bat . For a four and a half reeler it's quite tasty albeit weighed down by a hackneyed plot - the one where all the guys want to marry the girl with the dowry - but Prevert's linguistic touch is well in evidence and he can even be seen in a matelot-type striped jersey playing the flute . Julien Carrette is also on hand and that is always a good sign . The majority of the cast were and remain relatively unknown - Sound was still a new concept in French cinema and actors were selected as much for how they sounded as for acting ability - but the film is definitely more than a curio .
409990	2567136	44753	7.0	Blade Ruiner	Gordon Douglas was something of a poor man's Michael Curtiz at Warner Brothers inasmuch as he could turn his hand to just about any genre the studio assigned him to . In the early fifties Alan Ladd had run out of exotic locations to meet Veronica Lake and William Bendix at Paramount and although his greatest performance and greatest Paramount film by far ( Shane ) was already in the can though unreleased his agent wife Sue Carroll brokered a deal that took him to Warners who , being hip to his stand-out performance in Shane , laid on another ' Western ' to welcome him aboard . As a biography of Jim Bowie it fits where it touches and concludes with no reference to the Alamo - probably a bit tricky as Bowie winds up the movie married to the daughter of a Mexican official . That aside it's a fine example of the genre with Ladd on top of his game albeit playing Bowie as a nice guy who can't seem to help killing people , mostly as a result of his involvement with super-bitch socialite Virginia Mayo . In terms of Ladd's overall career it ranks well inside the top half and will surely entertain viewers .
409119	2567136	179096	7.0	Ivory Coasting	Richard Pottier , all but forgotten today , was as fine a journeyman as any director working in French cinema - he was actually born in what used to be known as the Austro-Hungarian empire in the middle of the twentieth century ; he worked with Prevert , Fernandel and directed no less than five movies for Continental during the occupation and was at home in most types of film making him something of a small-scale Michael Curtiz . This hugely enjoyable entry would hardly claim to be original - two film flam men team up with a femme fatale to take a rich pigeon and forget their original goal when they realise he possesses a ' treasure ' map which , if interpreted correctly will leave them up to their asses in ivory - but , as is so often the case , it's all in the wrists and when the wrists are on hands belonging to Isa Miranda we're in relatively safe hands .
409291	2567136	54494	8.0	Bizarre Notes From Underground	This is a screen adaptation of one of those novels they said couldn't be filmed . Raymonde Queneau is a sort of James Joyce-lite whose work is studded with word-play but Jean-Paul Rappeneau and director Louis Malle make it work . A simple premise - Zazie , played by 12 year old Catherine Demongeot , is brought to Paris by her mother and dumped on uncle ( Philippe Noiret ) so mom can enjoy some R and R with her latest boyfriend . Zazie has only one desire , to see and ride on the Metro but the Metro is on strike - spins out of control as foul-mouthed Zazie takes off on her own and encounters a succession of pre-Monty Python / Basil Fawlty types in nothing flat . As if this bouillabaisse needed seasoning Uncle is a drag artist though straight with it . If you don't respond to zany humour you'll find it infantile - as at least one commenter did - if not chances are you'll rejoice .
409223	2567136	45592	8.0	Call Me Bashful	In almost every way Sally Adams was the perfect role for La Merm ; brash , vulgar , strident , these were qualities she acquired seemingly in the womb and the role called for them all - in spades . It's also arguably the best of Irving Berlin's four ' Book ' shows - he was represented on Broadway several times but largely in Revues until 1946 when he inherited Annie Get Your Gun after the death of Jerry Kern ; he followed with the ho-hum Miss Liberty , the turkey Mr . President and in between Call Me Madam , his second vehicle for Merman . From the opening credits , displayed on a gorgeous blue background on the old three-neg Technicolor as one great number segues into another in the overture there's a good feeling about the movie and once it gets underway it seldom lets up so that even the one jarring note , the wooden performance of Vera Ellen can't really louse it up . Merm , who can't even SPEAK in a conversational tone , is presumably on top of her game whilst acting / charm honors are divided equally between Donal O'Connor and George Sanders . One of the best film adaptations of a Broadway musical .
408786	2567136	413895	8.0	Spin Doctor	There's a major hurdle facing anyone who contemplates adapting Elwyn Brook White into another medium ; they're tampering with the supreme Stylist ( he even co-authored the definitive work on the subject , The Elements of Style ) so it's no contest for the average Hollywood Hack , and Susannah Grant and Karey Kirkpatrick ARE Hollywood hacks ( possibly self-awareness / frustration led them to name the two inept crows unable to distinguish a scarecrow from a flesh and blood person and who wind up trapped , Elwyn and Brooks ) . That said the film gets by on charm and the Universal Truths which is its stock in trade . Where White's original lines have been retained it takes on an extra dimension and like the original book it doesn't attempt a ' happy ' ending . Another strength is adhering to a ' period ' feel with no intrusive ' modern ' culture or falling standards of behaviour . If you are going to try to ' humanise ' a spider you could do a lot worse than have it ' voiced ' by Julia Roberts who is arguably known as a lovely person by more than half the movie-going world . In terms of ' life lessons ' this is not unlike Andy Hardy Down On The Farm which , as I mean it , is no bad thing .
410281	2567136	43577	8.0	Catwalk	He walks through walls and she's a cat-burglar ; as winning parleys go that has to be up there with Sinatra , Crosby and Cole Porter in High Society . Director Jean Boyer will always have a special place in my heart because of the films he made with Arletty , okay , they were bread-and-butter entries but French bread and Normandy butter is not to be sneezed at . Joan Greenwood had been in films for ten years and had things like Kind Hearts And Coronets , Whiskey Galore and The Bad Lord Byron on her cv when she played the cat burglar who bewitches Bourvil to the extent that he masquerades as a celebrated criminal to impress her - nothing new there , Gene Kelly posed as notorious pirate Mack The Black to impress Judy Garland in The Pirate three years previously . Boyer gives us enough set pieces to flesh out the one-trick pony aspect and the whole is a delightful and charming romp . Recommended .
408877	2567136	93664	8.0	Best Of Breed	Whether this movie is based on , inspired by or just bears a passing resemblance to Chekhov's The Lady With The Little Dog is ultimately academic because what really matters is the movie as it stands , is it good , bad or ho-hum . It's actually rather good if anybody asks you . Sure , there are things that verge on hat of the very oldest kind , like the O'Henryish ending but the film transcends stuff like that easily . It begins with our old friend the Frame narrator buttonholing a passenger on a small cruise ship and laying his life-story on him . The information ladled out by the passenger - despite advancing years he is newly married ; he had loved and pursued his wife for years ; she in turn was unhappily married and could never love him but finally consented to marry him - over the length of the film is done so cunningly that only the professional film / story analyst will even sense a connection between this and the story told by Marcello Mastroianni , architect manque , married to Miss Gotrocks in the shape of Silvana Mangana , who is seized without warning by a passion for a Russian woman encountered by chance , so much so that he pursues her to her homeland and perseveres in the face of a burocray not unlike that encountered by Melvyn Douglas in HIS attempt to be reunited with Ninotchka , until he is finally able to travel to her small home town . The style is a hybrid of Chekhovian spareness and Visconti opulence but even this seems appropriate for a film determined to charm and seduce the discriminating viewer . Does it succeed ? What do you think .
410044	2567136	154509	8.0	Hardy Annual	In a career spanning 46 years Claude Autant-Lara directed some fifty movies several of which - Le Ble en herbe , L'Auberge Rouge , Fric Frac , Douce , Sylvie et la fantome , Le Diable au corps - are indispensable to any collection of French film classics and no two titles cover the same areas because versatility was a hallmark of Autant-Lara . He had dealt with the Second World War notably in the delicious black comedy La Traversee de Paris but nothing really prepared his admirers for this true story of a saintly man attempting in a very modest way to counter the evil all around him . Hardy Kruger , himself German and a one-time member of the Hitler Youth enjoyed a long if largely undistinguished career in movies but twice he was moved to appear in what may loosely be described as anti-war fare and both here and in Sundays With Cybele he lifted his game . This is a fine film that deserves to be seen by the discriminating viewer .
410102	2567136	827713	8.0	Loaded For Baer	This is a slightly uneven entry with one standout sequence involving an over-the-hill gang reminiscing in the diner that once - thirty years previously - was their hideout ; one ho-hum duologue between two ageing rock musos ; a noirish kidnap turned on its head and an opening sequence ( plus epilogue ) involving heist artist wannabe Edward Baer and current ' hot ' property Anna Magloulis which has its moments . No movie in which Jean Rochefort appears can be dismissed lightly and here he shines as one of the over-the-hill quintet , indeed the film is worth seeing for Rochefort alone but each of the sequences has something to offer and it's definitely worth a look .
409584	2567136	50976	8.0	Righters Block	I don't know about you but there are still several films that everyone and his Uncle Max seems to have seen but me . On the other hand I am gradually making headway via DVD , revivals , festivals , etc . Time was I felt deprived because I hadn't seen Citizen Kane , Casablanca , It's A Wonderful Life , The Wizard Of Oz , for God's sake but like I say they're all now safely under my belt and I feel the better for having caught up with them eventually . In the case of Bergman it's not just The Seventh Seal but practically everything he ever made that , for one reason or another , I haven't seen ; in fact off the top of my head I can recall seeing only Smiles Of A Summer Night and Autumn Sonata . Nor , if I'm honest , have I made any great attempt to watch him , most of the films are now available on DVD but I'm not exactly breaking a leg rushing to Virgin , FNAC or HMV but now The Seventh Seal has just opened commercially in London so , along with 8 other people I checked it out , exactly 50 years after it was released . The first thing I noticed was that it's not quite as grim as I had supposed and nor is the celebrated chess game given that much screen time - from all I'd read over the years I'd imagined a fairly static movie with these two symbolic characters trading moves for 90 minutes . Taint , so , honey , taint so . Following some portentous music we find ourselves on a craggy beach where the knight , Antonius Block , is resting . Beside him on a piece of fairly flat rock a chess board has been set up . This is a pretty unrealistic image with which to kick off a non-comedy film because no normal person would set out a chessboard in such an inhospitable place where the more or less constant wind would scatter the pieces every which way in nothing flat . So now Bergman has to get us past this incongruity and I guess that having ' Death ' appear in human form and accepting a challenge from Block - who can forestall his date with Death for the duration of the game and even cancel it altogether should he win - is as good a way as any . We then accompany Block and his squire as he returns home after ten years away from his wife - he's been to the Crusades if anybody asks you - which immediately reminds us of Agammemnon returning home to HIS wife after ten tough years in Troy and the Fall of the House of Atreus is as nought compared to the angst that visits Block . The images are striking at times , the acting is more than accomplished and in fact the only jarring note is just that , in fact not just one note but the several that make up the score which has a habit of SHOUTING at us when it wants to underline something instead of employing a more subtle approach . It's nice to be able to cross it off my list but I won't be breaking my neck to see it again and nor am I likely to buy the DVD .
408796	2567136	31762	8.0	High Flier	Probably more so than any other director Howard Hawks had a knack of coming in at the tail-end of a genre , reinventing it and more often than not turning in the definitive movie in that genre . He did it with screwball comedy with Bringing Up Baby , with Westerns in successive decades via Red River and Rio Bravo , thrillers with The Big Sleep and here , literally at the tail-end of both a decade ( 30s ) and the genre that helped define the decade he does it with the ' flying ' picture . No less than eleven leading players and supporting and / or ' character ' actors keep the pot boiling in a multi-faceted storyline that embodies Hawks respect for the ' professional ' summed up succinctly in Grant's terse advice to Arthur when she asks / offers to play the piano ' You better be good ' . In Hawk's world you're either a pro i . e . good at what you do or you're a waste of space a la Noah Beery Jnr ' Joe Souther , who crashes fatally in the first ten minutes because , as Grant says ' he wasn't good enough ' . For the record this is one - if not THE - movie where Grant says ' Judy ' several times throughout but never more than once on each occasion when he addresses the gal who done him wrong Judy McPherson ( Rita Hayworth ) now married to another flier , Bat Kilgallan ( McPherson ) , Richard Barthelmess , who changed his name in an attempt to avoid the stigma of baling out of a plane and leaving his navigator to die in it . For trivia buffs it's possible to see a connection between the short sequence where Barthelmess - who gets all the lousy jobs because of his reputation - flies a cargo of nitro glycerin through a pass in rough weather as the genesis for George H Clouzot's The Wages Of Fear in which four men drive a similar cargo in two trucks over bumpy terrain in the same part of the world , South America , but for everyone it's first rate entertainment from a vintage era and if I mention ALL the players by name - Allyn Joslyn , Victor Kilian , Sig Ruman , John Carroll , Thomas Mitchell , Don ' Red ' Barry , Noah Beery Jnr - and throw in the leads - Cary Grant , Jean Arthur , Rita Hayworth , Richard Barthelmess - it's because they ARE that good , pros to a man . See , Enjoy .
408938	2567136	35336	8.0	Is It A Plane , Is It A Bird . . .	. . . no , it's Fernandel who THINKS he's a bird ( Don't ask ) . By now we are used to hearing orchestras strike up to accompany someone who feels moved to start singing in the street , or even in the rain , but this is arguably the first and only time an unseen orchestra has been on hand to accompany a man who bursts into song whilst nestling in a tree . Why a tree ? Simple , where else would you find a bird or , to put it another way , Simplet , where else would you find an actor named Fernandel who directed himself playing a character named Simplet whose natural habitat appears to be a tree from where he ' talks ' to the birds , thus anticipating Alan Jay Lerner who would later write a song entitled I Talk To The Trees . Alfred Greven , the honcho at Continental Films was nothing if not shrewd and to lure Fernandel into working for the German-run company he not only allowed him to direct but also to bring his brother-in-law , Jean Manse on board as co-screenwriter and lyricist - and for good measure allowed Manse to appear in a small role . The story is pure fluff , the village is making a modest living from the visitors who come there to see Simplet so that when he is exiled to a neighboring village they begin to feel the pinch and want him back ( shades of Pagnol's La Femme du Boulanger which had appeared three years previously , but Manse wasn't going to let a little larceny impair the goose laying the golden eggs ) . As a second strand there is Simplet's yen for La Cigale who is already in a relationship but prepared to string him along . By 1941 of course Fernandel was as big a star as anyone including Gabin and Raimu and audiences weren't about to worry about nepotism or plagiarism . He made them laugh . Sue him .
409806	2567136	35446	8.0	A Fellow Of Infinite Jest . . .	. . . as Shakespeare didn't say of Ernst Lubitsch but may very well have had he lived in the 20th century . This was one of his last films and one of an unbroken string of ' classics ' including Bluebeard's Eighth Wife , Ninotchka and Heaven Can Wait . At least one person writing about To Be Or Not To Be here wondered in print if Billy Wilder had a hand in the screenplay ; whilst it's easy to see why someone might think that the answer is no - Wilder , of course , co-wrote the screenplays for both Bluebeard's Eighth Wife and Nonotchka - though the whole premise of the movie is very Wilderian , a Black Comedy about the rape of Poland by the Nazis actually shot whilst the violation was taking place , as good a definition of inflagrante delicto as any I know of , this is compounded by the rape of Shakespeare by a ham actor , Jozef Tura a dream part for Jack Benny who was a better actor than he was given credit for having for years played on radio ( and later television ) a character light years away from his real persona . Just as Wilder would do in his own films - The Apartment , for example - Lubitsch switches effortlessly between laugh-out-loud comedy and the real drama of a nation under siege and having selected a consummate group of actors from top-billed Carole Lombard to the cream of supporting players such as Sig Ruman , Felix Bressart , Stanley Ridges he got the very best out of them and even Robert Stack in a thankless under-developed role wasn't a total loss . A brilliant comedy that still stands up today .
409999	2567136	33485	8.0	Honey , He Shrunk The Id	Apart from anything else this is a wonderful chance to savour not only two of the finest French actors in Raimu and Pierre Brasseur but also some of the mainstays of French Cinema , names like Saturnin Fabre , Blanchette Brunoy and Gabrielle Fontan who I sometimes think has been in every French film I love whilst leading lady Sylvia Bataille has a cv that boasts such standout titles as Jenny , Le Crime de Monsieur Lange and Les Portes de la nuit - trivia buffs would no doubt kvel to learn that Bataille , whose screen husband here undergoes psychoanalysis , married one psychoanalyst ( Jacques Lacan ) and was the mother of another ( Laurence Bataille ) . Both Jean Anouilh and Jean Aurenche worked on the screenplay alongside future director Yves Allegret and pedigrees don't come much more distinguished ; this was still a good six years before Aurenche forged an enduring partnership with Pierre Bost and this was only his second screenplay but you wouldn't know it from the assurance on display . This was the era of Screwball Comedy and that same year Preston Sturges wrote Easy Living for Jean Arthur and Ray Milland and if this isn't quite in that league it is , nevertheless , a captivating soufflé ' based on the somewhat flimsy , not to say ridiculous , premise that a customs official asking a perfectly logical and totally expected question to whit : have you anything to declare , should render the interrogatee , Pierre Brasseur , impotent - Brasseur was on his honeymoon and the question was posed on a sleeping-car with a border imminent . Out of this Aurenche , Allegret and Anouilh spin a gossamer-thin web of hilarity in which Brasseur's father-in-law , Raimu is a principal player and Saturnin Fabres shrink has to be seen to be believed . All in all this is a delightful romp in which the lover of French Cinema will revel in the cast like a kid let loose in a sweet shop .
409804	2567136	35415	8.0	Tuxedo Junction	I think it's fairly safe to say that this is the finest film that Julien Duvivier made outside France , let alone made in America ; Anna Karenina which he made in England doesn't really compete with the Don Camillo films he shot in Italy - in fact on reflection The Little World Of Don Camillo may tie Tales Of Manhattan for Best - Duvivier - Made - Outside - France . He was a master of the ' anthology ' movie and both Un Carnet de bal and Sous le ciel de Paris are outstanding examples that had the advantage of tighter scripting - in Tales Of Manhattan the roster of credited writers threatens to outnumber the cast and Duvivier deserves a small accolade for unifying so many diverse styles into a cohesive whole . Others have provided details of the several episodes as well as pointing out that not Every sequence takes place in Manhattan , notably the final sequence which is set in the Deep South and provides a perfect coda when the tuxedo in question finds a final resting place on a scarecrow . It feels as if every Hollywood actor who wasn't on active service in 1942 was on Duvivier's set standing up to be counted and Phil Silvers is brilliant in an all-too-brief segment working a pre-Bilko scam on W . C . Fields . A delight .
409787	2567136	397692	8.0	Building Up To An Awful Let-Down . . .	. . . to paraphrase the lyric Johnny Mercer wrote to Fred Astaire's music way back when . This features the delectable Carole Bouquet as a lawyer with two adolescents and no husband on her hands . What she is happy to treat as a one-night stand backfires when the guy in question falls in love with her and decides to move in . In real life a lawyer wouldn't have much of a problem getting him to leave but this is movies as opposed to real life so the solution she comes up with is to have the whole house renovated . Predictably it winds up as a sort of Mr . Blandings Builds His Dream House-lite with chaos accelerating until just when everything collapsible has collapsed and been rebuilt half the crew turn out to be illegals with no papers so the flics raid the joint , the illegals take it on the Jesse Owens but not without destroying the house again . There's lots to enjoy here not least Bouquet letting her hair down .
408806	2567136	194201	8.0	Don't Take It As Gospel	The Champo - a small cinema du quartier in Paris - is to be applauded for staging this major retrospective of Sacha Guitry ; since January of this year they've been screening one Guitry title twice a day from a pool of twenty five which means they've now screened all of them at least twice . Most of the time it's difficult to believe they come even close to the nut but today , perhaps because it was a Bank Holiday , there were about 60 patrons for the second screening at 4 pm . This is Guitry in urban mode which means sophisticated well-dressed people sitting in salons dishing dirt and playing sexual games . The only thing that comes anywhere near Guitry in this mode is Noel Coward and even that is slightly misleading ; they were both primarily playrights , yes , and they tended to write with a swizzle stick rather than a pen , yes again , but really they were chalk and cheese . This is prime Guitry , nuff said .
408836	2567136	401997	8.0	The Red And The Black	When Stendhal coined the title The Red and The Black he used red for the military and black for the church but in this sense red can also mean Communism , the Communism espoused by devout Catholic Hansenn who , as we now know is the greatest traitor in American history . In the way in which it eschews sensationalism and concentrates on the day-to-day routine of unmasking a spy Breach is a fine complement to The Lives Of Others which concentrates on the day-to-day spying ON individuals . In both cases we know the outcome - Hansenn was caught and is now doing time , the Stasi was disbanded - but this does little or nothing to diminish the enjoyment as the respective stories unfold and both films are blessed with great acting . In this case Chris Cooper turns in arguably the best performance of a fine career and Laura Linney adds one more character to an outstanding portfolio . This is one to buy on DVD .
408911	2567136	42949	8.0	Twelve O'Clock High	Despite a long and active career , which included amongst other things supplying the off-screen ' voice ' of Lord Haw Haw in Twelve O'Clock High and creating the role of Socrates in the Broadway production of Maxwell Anderson's Barefoot In Athens , Barry Jones was relatively unknown to cinema-goers in 1950 which made him an ideal choice for Professor Willoughby who , well-shod in London , intends to detonate a nuclear device in its centre unless the Prime Minister agrees to issue a statement prepared by Willoughby . This is one of those British films that DO stand up half a century later which is not , of course , the same as saying they are without flaws - for one thing we never see Willoughby until he has stolen the nuclear device , left home , wife and daughter and made his way to London . What we feel the loss of is a sense of seeing him being slowly driven from brilliant scientist and nondescript family man to someone prepared to unleash devastation on a great capital city . Joan Hickson and Olive Sloan are both solid in support as is Andre Morrell , charged with the task of finding Willoughby but others characters , Willoughby's daughter , his colleague and son-in-law-in-waiting are cheapest cardboard cutouts . Overall the pace is the thing that keeps it interesting , that and the period ' feel ' of a lost London . Definitely worth a look .
410153	2567136	27630	8.0	Follow Fleet-Footed Fred	This was the second of three films that Irving Berlin wrote for the Astaire-Rogers franchise and it has by far the largest score and is somewhat unusual in that two of the numbers are performed by Harriet Hilliard leaving the rest to be divvied and / or shared between the principals . As usual the storyline needn't detain us though for the record it was based on a play , Shore Leave , that also served as the basis for a Broadway Musical , Hit The Deck . Anyone who actually saw Shore Leave in the theatre may have been momentarily bemused inasmuch as the roles played by Fred and Ginger were created for the movie but what matters , as always , is the music , lyrics and hoofing and this is all out of the right bottle . It's a departure from the other titles in the franchise in that 1 ) we get to see Astaire play the piano - in real life he was an accomplished pianist and composed several songs , one of which , I'm Building Up To An Awful Let-Down , had a lyric by Johnny Mercer and spent a couple of weeks in the charts - and it is the only one of the series in which he played a serviceman , albeit an ex-hoofer who enlisted in the navy after being dumped by dancing partner Ginger before the story starts . He gets to perform a little-known but excellent Berlin number , I'd Rather Lead A Band as well as duetting on I'm Putting All My Eggs In One Basket but the ultimate number is the prophetic - in 1936 rumbles of World War II were already being felt - Let's Face The Music And Dance , one of the most potent ballads ever performed by the team . So what if Randolph Scott is a little wooden and fish-out-of-water without either a horse or a six-gun within easy reach and Harriet Hilliard doesn't exactly set the screen on fire ; we came to see Fred and Ginger and the only question is , do they deliver . Answer : In spades .
409473	2567136	57967	8.0	Tourist Trap	Outstanding location shooting in two of Europe's most photogenic countries ( Italy and France ) , a comic ' caper ' plot with guns that don't really kill plus two of the greatest comedians in French cinema - Louis de Funes and Bourvil - has to be an unbeatable parlay and in fact the following year they did it again - or something very , very similar in Le Grande Vadrouille in which the director of both films , ex-actor Gerard Oury , brought his daughter , Danielle Thompson , on board as co-scriptwriter . It was also a nice touch to name the Louis de Funes character after the Armenian-American writer William Saroyan , now largely forgotten but once hugely popular whose schtick was humorous whimsey . The plot won't really stand scrutiny under a harsh light ; Bourvil's 2CV is totally written off by the roller of de Funes even before he has left Paris on his proposed driving holiday in Italy . Knowing a rube when he sees one de Funes makes Bourvil an offer he can't refuse ; the ' loan ' of a Cadillac which needs to be driven from Naples to Bordeaux plus a ticket to Naples and spending money . What Bourvil doesn't know , of course , is that the car is bristling with gold , heroin and diamonds and how unwittingly he gets rid of these en route is half the fun . Perhaps a tad dated forty years on but still one of the best ' feelgoods ' around .
408878	2567136	44602	8.0	Slasher Movie	The nearest I ever came to seeing this was a clip shown at a Gerard Philippe exposition in Paris about two years ago . I had no interest in the remake and having just caught up with the original just over half a century after it was made I can only conclude that the inept fencing was intentional , aimed at a long obsolete target . Hollywood had been doing realistic sword fights since the 30s when the greatest of them all , Basil Rathbone , crossed foils with Errol Flynn and others so the technique was available and so that leaves only satire . After a while you don't notice and revel in the Henri Jeanson dialogue reminiscent of the Prisoner Of Zenda , both versions . Gerard Philippe certainly had the presence to bring off a role like this and Gina Lollabrigida was probably a tad better than Martine Carol , the other obvious candidate at the time . The print I saw was particularly bad and at one point broke down completely so maybe a DVD version would enhance it .
409427	2567136	488565	8.0	I Believe I Like This	This is yet another of those ' little ' films the French do so well and nobody else seems to do at all . It ' never going to set the world on fire and , to be fair , it never aspires to ; there are no ' showcase ' roles and nobody feels the need to chew the scenery , it's just a small , solid entertainment with the leads placed in two of the safest pairs of hands in the business , Vincent Lindon and Sandrine Bonnaire , who are given top-class support by an ensemble headed by Francois Berleand and Kad Merad . Director Philippe Jolivet worked with Bonnaire on his last movie but one , Filles Uniques , which was in similar vein . The plot , such as it is , features Lindon as head of a large company which has hired Bonnaire to create a large piece of ceramic Art for the foyer . Clearly knowing a lovely girl when he sees one he falls for her but because he has once been bitten ( his ex wife was heavily into Industrial Espionage ) he is twice shy so he prevails on the Head of Security , Francois Berleand , to both check out her background and bug her apartment . With this much information you can write the rest yourself and chances are you'd be right on the money but as I keep saying it's all in the wrist and the wrists involved here are as supple as they come . A lovely way to spend an evening .
409754	2567136	387898	8.0	Hide In Plain Sight	I've never much cared for this director who has always seemed bent on shocking and sickening his audiences into submission with every graphic image in the book but here he gets his effects much more . . . well perhaps subtly is the wrong word but certainly in a more subdued way so that when the graphics come they genuinely surprise the viewer unlike say The Piano Teacher where the viewer is merely waiting for him to do something even more outre . The film is full of nods to technique and manipulation as in the scene where Daniel Auteuil is ' editing ' the TV programme he hosts by removing large chunks of dialogue as if to remind us that we HERE in the cinema watching this film are seeing ONLY what the director WANTS us to see in order to make his points . Virtually every comment I've read here mentions the subtext involving the French treatment of Algerians and it is probably no accident that Daniel Auteuil , himself born in Algeria , was approached - and obviously agreed - to play the lead . Fine performances abound with even what amount to cameos by Annie Girardot , Bernard Le Coq and Denis Podalydes scoring heavily . Juliette Binoche is clearly happy to appear deglamourized and slightly zaftig and for all of that delivers a performance only a notch below that of Auteuil . This is definitely a film that both requires and will reward multiple viewings .
409006	2567136	1024896	8.0	The Same Old Song And Dance	This is arguably the perfect film for this time of year . Boy Meets Girl , Boy Gets Girl . . . well , you know the sort of thing . Despite racking up about sixty films between them neither of the leads is really known outside France ; Jean-Paul Rouve had a small role - a postman - in A Very Long Engagement and in the film he made before this he was Edith Piaf's father in La Mome but neither role marked him out as a romantic lead and his features do nothing to help . Melanie Doutey on the other hand IS a looker and may best be described as an Auèdrey Tautou lookalike with backbone . In terms of story what can I tell you ; they meet , have a relationship , part and you don't need to know the rest except for some reason it's the second romantic comedy currently playing the salles in Paris where the ending takes place in Manhattan . If feel-good is your thing , go see ; you'll feel good . Trust me , I'm a play doctor .
410278	2567136	36803	8.0	I Liked It ; That's The Gospel Truth	There's something nicely symmetrical in the fact that this movie was adapted from a play by Maxwell Anderson . Almost forgotten today Anderson began his career with the Broadway hit play What Price Glory ( c0-written with Lawrence Stallings ) . Produced in 1924 and twice filmed it was , of course , set in World War One and was a comedy about the love-hate relationship between Flagg and Quirt , sergeant and private . Twenty years on Anderson was more philosophical as perhaps befits someone with a penchant for writing in blank verse . He also turned his hand to writing lyrics and collaborated twice with composer Kurt Weill on Knickerbocker Holiday and Lost In The Stars , neither exactly laff riots though the former did produce the evergreen September Song . By 1944 the was was definitely swinging in the favour of the Allies but this didn't guarantee that no blood was spilled . Farmboy William Eythe is the main protagonist but both his family , sweetheart , and his platoon get plenty of screen time and equit themselves well , not least Ray Collins , usually a belligerent banker / politician but here subdued as Eythe's farmer father . Ann Baxter may be wasted as Eythe's girl back home but there is a nice ensemble feel to the whole thing . Dated , perhaps , but still worth a look . . )
409753	2567136	68240	9.0	Dead Meat-Cute	Perhaps the highest praise one can heap on this film is that despite it being obvious what is going to happen within the first twenty minutes we still keep watching with silly smiles on our faces basking in the warmth of Wilder's genius and licking the cream of his jests off our metaphorical whiskers . Wilder was , of course , a master of the meet-cute and one could even argue that he had a childlike preoccupation with them unless , of course , you appreciate the thought that goes into them . Some filmmaker's careers - notably Orson Welles - are littered with unrealized projects , Wilder left a list of unrealized meet-cutes behind him like the two psychiatrists who both send their couches out for reupholstering and guess what . . . This time around the protagonists rather than meeting over a couple of stiff drinks do so over a couple of stiffs ; his ( Jack Lemmon ) father and her ( Juliet Mills ) mother who have enjoyed a same-time-next-year extra marital fling for the last ten years on the photogenic island of Ischia and might be doing so still had their car not run off the road . We learn this relatively quickly which was what I meant about knowing how it's going to pan out from reel # 1 . The trick is , of course , to start with a pair of antagonists and watch and wait for them to realize what we've known all along . The Italian setting is apposite because this kind of love-hate thing arguably began with Beatrice and Benedek who might , also arguably , have had a better scriptwriter than Wilder and Izzy Diamond ; on the other hand . . . The film is replete with Wilder ' touches ' such as the official in the morgue meticulously arranging forms , stamps and pads or the nonogenarian dancing with his young nurses - and recalling Lemmon himself dancing with ' senior citizen ' Joe E . Brown in Wilder's Some Like It Hot . Music was a great love of Wilder's life and whilst very few of his films are totally music free in others it plays a significant part - think of , in no particular order , Love In The Afternoon , Sabrina Fair , One , Two , Three , etc - and here he uses a background of evocative ' mood ' music notably the lovely Senza Fine which does double duty translating as it does to ' without end ' . Wilder has again turned for his source material to a play by Samuel Taylor who also wrote Sabrina and again Taylor has conceived a soufflé , the epitome of Romantic Comedy that is only enhanced by Wilder's mordant wit . It may be late-blooming Wilder but the bloom is definitely on this rose . One to cherish .
409270	2567136	273148	9.0	Chamber Of Horrors	World War One has been enjoying something of a vogue recently and not least in French Cinema , which on balance is currently the best in the world . Only a couple of years ago we had the superb Les Ames Grises and a couple of years before that Francois Dupeyron adapted a best-selling novel into this wonderful movie . Following a brief scene-setting sequence in which the leading man , Eric Caravaca , is shown to be flawed , he is badly wounded whilst on a recce to find a suitable spot to build a bridge . The ordinariness of this - as opposed to wounds sustained in actual combat - serves to accentuate his terrible facial injuries which are so bad that for the next hour of screen time we see only the reactions of others rather than a head-on shot of his face . The pace is slow , stately even and none the worse for that although they'll give it short shrift in the Multiplexes , and Dupeyron succeeds in drawing us in to this singular world where eventually Caravaca is joined by three other officers with similar wounds . The acting is beyond praise but then so it should be with actors of the caliber of Sabine Azema , Andre Dussollier , Denis Podalydes and relative newcomer Gregoire Derangere who has since done sterling work in Bon Voyage , L'Equippier and Le Passagere d'Ete . As anti-war statements go this belongs right alongside La Grande Illusion , Paths Of Glory , All Quiet On The Western Front , in other words , amongst the cream .
409488	2567136	41786	9.0	The Bad Shepperd	Ophuls plants a bold visual clue at the very beginning of this masterpiece that alerts us to the fact that things are not always what they seem ; as a narrator's voice-over sets the scene , Balboa , a small town 50 miles from Los Angeles , Joan Bennett emerges in a HEAVY WOOLLEN TOPCOAT and gets in her car to drive to Los Angeles for a rendez-vous with the ' older ' man who has been dating her teen-age daughter . You don't wear this kind of clothing even in Winter in Southern California and Bennett's son is invariably naked to the waist out of doors and when top-billed James Mason appears - after half an hour of a 79 minute film - he too is attired in a topcoat . The older man is played by Shepperd Strudwick , a competent journeyman actor on both stage and screen and one who could do solid , dependable family men as well as smooth con men as he does here . Inside two reels Strudwick is dead and Bennett's daughter is looking good for a murder rap but this is a Max Ophuls film - it was , in fact , the last of his Hollywood films and followed closely on the heels of Letter From An Unknown Woman and Caught . European directors had a penchant for making ' noir ' films set in daylight and out of doors and around the same time Jacques Tourneur made Out Of The Past set largely in Northern rather than Southern California ; I wouldn't like to choose between them but The Reckless Moment is a tad more cerebral and Ophuls ' celebrated fluid camera is on hand to help the story along . The main thrust has Mason's blackmailer being smitten by Bennett and ultimately crossing his ' partner ' and paying the price but with Ophuls it's not so much the story but the technique and this is a gem .
409559	2567136	28333	9.0	ForEVER Gonna Dance	There are three strong contenders for the best Astaire-Rogers film ( excluding the Barkleys of Broadway ) of the nine they made at RKO , Top Hat , Shall We Dance and this one which may just have the edge . The success of Top Hat the previous year led to a similar approach - Helen Broderick was again on hand to dole out the wisecracks , Astaire had another comic sidekick , Victor Moore depping for Edward Everett Horton ( he even has the first name Everett though is known as Pops ) , Eric Blore appears in the first couple of reels and lays a handful of his slow burns on us and a Latino-flavored love rival for Astaire , this time around George Metaxa instead of Erik Rhodes . The script also is a tad - no more than that - more credible than the others but ultimately it's all about the singing and dancing and this score is again just a little more varied than the others from the feelgood Pick Yourself Up through the romantic ballad The Way You Look Tonight to the best number in the score the dark Never Gonna Dance . Rogers could barely carry a tune and her voice lacked timbre but she was always given at least one number and here she is heard on Pick Yourself Up and A Fine Romance whilst Fred , as befits one for whom all the Great Songwriters lined up to have him sing their songs , gets the lion's share of vocals and turns in unforgettable readings of Bojangles , The Way You Look Tonight and the standout Never Gonna Dance , an erroneous title if ever there was one for this duo is forever gonna dance in our hearts and memories .
409612	2567136	99200	9.0	Golden Baule	This was the fifth of the nine films Diane Kurys has so far directed and the third of three ( Diabolo Menthe , Coup de Foudre being the others ) that deal with her own experiences in childhood and adolescence . In the second film , Coup de Foudre , the character based on Kury's own mother and fictionalised as Lena was played by Isabelle Huppert whilst here Nathalie Baye assumes the role opposite Richard Berry as husband / father Michel . The action has moved on from the war and post-war years in Lyon ( Kury's own home town ) to the late 1950s when thirteen year old Frederique ( Julie Bataille ) , the closest character to the young Kurys herself and her eight year old sister Sophie are taken by their Nanny Odette ( Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi ) to the seaside for the summer vacation . A pre-credit sequence reveals to us the gulf ( explored first in Coup de Foudre ) that now exists between the parents and which the sisters are perhaps subconsciously aware . At the last minute - literally at the railway station itself - they realize that Lena will not accompany them . Once established at the resort they take out their frustration on Odette as a ploy to force their mother to join them but when she does so she spends more time with a lover Claude ( Vincent Lindon ) than with them . Also on hand are Leon ( Jean-Pierre Bacri and the highly fertile Bella ( Zabou ) and when Michel shows up he deliberately destroys the car that symbolised Lena's independence and engages in a verbal and physical quarrel with Lena that is so intense that Frederique threatens to kill herself with a shard of glass broken during their fighting . This is an outstanding film in which the pain of adolescence is once-removed through the filter of nostalgia and replete with the tiny ' touches ' - popular songs of the day , etc - that we use as signposts to lead us back into the past . Fifteen years on it's fascinating to see the younger versions of six exceptional French actors two of whom ( Zabou with Se Souvenirs des belles chooses , and Bruni-Tedeschi with Il est plus facile pour un chameau . . . ) would go on to direct outstanding films themselves . I can't recommend this one highly enough .
409297	2567136	814659	9.0	Madness In Great Ones . . .	. . . should not unwatched go . Shakespeare came up with that line some 400 years ago yet he might have been referring to Isabelle Carre's tour de force in this movie . Carre IS without doubt a Great actress and seems to have made a speciality out of sickness ; her portrait of a young woman stricken with Alzheimer's in Zabou Breitman's Se Souvenirs des belles choses was unforgettable and it would have been unthinkable had any other actress copped the Best Actress Cesar that year . In Anna M she does it again but this time without the self-awareness of her character in Se Souvenirs . Okay , we can't drag the story into a strong light less the flaws hit us in the face - for example a woman like Anna would never in a million years secure a job as a nanny to two young girls seemingly without a single reference and based on a five minute interview , nor would a locksmith be prepared to break into an apartment on the say so of a barely plausible young woman claiming to live there . We're prepared to overlook this sloppy writing solely because the performance of Carre IS so towering , so majestic . We know that Americans don't do irony but can we , I wonder , say as much for the French ; in A la folle . . . pas de tout Isabelle Carre played the wife of doctor Samuel L Bihan who was stalked by a deranged Audrey Tautou , convinced he was in love with her ; in Anna M Carre plays the stalker and Anne Consigny has Carre's old role as doctor Gilbert Melki's innocent wife . The films even share a final moment when in each case the seemingly ' cured ' leading lady shows the audience that this is far from the case . Tautou is , of course , a fine actress but Carre is a Great one who gives a performance here , only the sloppy plotting mentioned above drags the rating to .
410291	2567136	73864	9.0	Son Of A Gun	Overall the Cesars get it right in terms of Best Film and if they occasionally make a complete dog's breakfast of it - as they did with L'Esquive - they have a large backlog of rewarding films as fine as this one . Robert Enrico dealt with War memorably in Au Coeur de la vie and here he does so again ; different war , age-old tragedies . Superficially this comes under the ' last straw that broke the camel's back ' heading crossed with what may be described as the Destry Rides Again syndrome , the protagonist finally driven to take up the gun once cast aside . Enrico begins with an idyllic sequence as the Dandieu family complete with dog cycle through a countryside in which God is in his heaven and all's right with the world . The image freezes and a caption supplies the date : 1944 . We then meet the family again in wartime ; Julien ( Phillipe Noiret ) , Clara ( Romy Schneider ) and young daughter Florence . Even in wartime this is a HAPPY family and unprepossessing men everywhere are thinking they could do with a drop-dead gorgeous wife like Schneider whilst kids in the wake of mild chastisement wish they could belong to a family like THAT . Indeed Julien is so laid-back he makes Bing Crosby seem riddled with tension and the film hinges on what makes this worm turn . With the Germans advancing Julien prevails upon a friend to drive wife , daughter and dog to a country retreat he owns in a fairly isolated spot . When he gets a minute he drives up there himself just in time to see his daughter shot and his wife incinerated by a flame-thrower making a full set of dead villagers . This , of course , is when he feels the need for revenge and so breaks out his old hunting rifle . This is where we may wonder why it has taken so much to rouse this peaceful man ; it is , after all , 1944 , the fifth year of a world war and one in which France has been occupied for most of it ; surely even as a civilian he has seen sufficient horrors and as a surgeon has dealt with them at first hand . The next question we find ourselves asking is why he is content to go up against men armed with pistols , rifles , machine guns , grenades and flame-throwers with only a shotgun rather than picking off one man and appropriating his weaponry . If we don't dwell on these logical questions it is because the performances are so compelling as is Enrico's narrative style which switches back and forth in time but not necessarily chronologically and keeps well in reserve such relevations as the fact that Schneider already had the daughter when she met Noiret and was well aware of his plainness . This is nothing short of superb ; beautifully written , directed and acted , and more than worthy of its Best Film Cesar .
409319	2567136	97322	9.0	Diamond Is A Boys ' Best Friend	This is a gem that stands up to repeated viewings . It manages to blend the sleazy , small-time world of fringe lounges , clubs with the affluent Resort Hotels seamlessly . Jeff Bridges plays his role not unlike a down-at-heels private eye - think Paul Newman in Harper , for example - while real-life brother Beau contrives to be pompous and nerdish at one and the same time . The score is typical of the sort of music you hear in cocktail lounges and realistic , as is the mood of Jeff Bridges who hankers to dispense with schmaltz and play cool jazz . Add catalyst Michelle Pfeiffer and we're talking near perfect . Definitely stands up to repeat viewings .
408895	2567136	47892	9.0	Chips With Everything	Jean-Pierre Melville has a lot to answer for ; had he not turned out such a great professional low-budget-shot-on-location movie as this then amateurs like Godard may have been content to watch instead of attempt to MAKE movies . That to one side this remains , at more or less fifty years old , a great film ( though the print I've just viewed has clearly seen better days and actually ignited during the screening . Melville was heavily influenced by American ' gangster ' movies and didn't care who knew it and it's arguable that the bulk of his stick-of-gum budget went on cigarettes as virtually no character is seen without one for the duration . In those innocent days all Melville had to do was put Roger Duchesne in a trench-coat and snap-brim hat and the audience could have written the ' back-story ' for themselves . A great percentage of Melville's triumph in his first polar is in the atmosphere , the ' feel ' of the milieu - I know the area in question quite well but I didn't get there for a good thirty years or so after Decae's camera had shot this valentine and though recognizable it was definitely a victim of progress , like Bob himself , who epitomizes the thirties of Gabin , Prevert and Carne and finds himself in a world of Vadims . So many posters have itemized the plot line that it would be superfluous to do so again , suffice it to say it is highly recommended .
409694	2567136	54997	9.0	Cue Heavy Mitting	I've just seen this movie days after Paul Newman died ; it is , perhaps , inevitable and certainly fitting that the television channels will be screening tributes in the near future and if they are all of this quality then I for one will be content . Like all actors of the first rank Newman made his share of turkeys and we needn't be reminded of them at this time . The Hustler works on every level to which it aspires including furnishing an idea of the life of a professional pool player which was way down its list of priorities for first and foremost it is our old friend the Morality Tale in drag . Newman takes his character , ' Fast ' Eddie Felson all the way from callow , arrogant punk to mature , sadder-but-wiser man in the space of a few months in real time and Piper Laurie must have been a revelation to those who knew her only as cheesecake in Universal programmers of the early fifties . It is difficult , in fact , to nominate even a mediocre performance and if George C . Scott draws the flashier and lengthier of the supporting roles Myron McCormick , Vincent Gardenia and Murray Hamilton can certainly not be overlooked and , like the credits , I save Jackie Gleason as Minnesota Fats for last . A gem of a performance in a gem of a film .
409803	2567136	206569	9.0	Killing Mockingbirds	It's difficult to believe that the Robert Enrico who made Les Aventuriers also made Au Couer de la vie a decade previously because the two are chalk and cheese having only directorial talent in common . A cynic may remark that Enrico had been frightened by Max Ophuls after noting the way his camera is seldom if ever static , circling the action constantly , creeping through the woods like a Comanche war party surrounding settlers but fluid camera-work is only one of the stylistic strings on Enrico's bow . He has taken three stories by Ambrose Bierce all illuminating some aspect of The War Between The States ( 1861-64 ) , often erroneously labelled the American Civil War , and melded them into a powerful - all the more so because it is largely silent - anti-War statement . All three stories blur the boundaries between reality and the supernatural and the first segment ' Mockingbird ' is the ideal introduction to the concept when a soldier , rewarded for bravery with a furlough , falls asleep and dreams of a Past that is still in the Future and all too soon becomes the Present . The second segment ' Chickamauga ' is a tour de force in which the actual battle is unseen but ' felt ' by a deaf-mute child who subsequently plays among the dead victims and induces them to rise and follow his reverse Pied Piper in a danse macabre . The last segment ' An Incident At Owl Creek Bridge ' was widely shown in the 1960s as a ' short ' and is arguably the most lyrical of the three ; a condemned man is hanged from the eponymous bridge and dropped into the river where , miraculously , he is able to free himself and out-swim the bullets of the hanging detail . Joyously he runs all the way home to the arms of his waiting wife but then . . . This is yet another neglected masterpiece that separates the men of Real French Cinema from the boys of the new wavelet which , by 1963 , was barely a trickle and as dbmonteuil has said in his own perceptive review another one or two films of this quality around 1958-61 and the nouvelle vague wouldn't even have been a joke .
408962	2567136	39822	9.0	Speaking Volumes	This fine film has a lot to answer for : when , in 1949 , Jean-Pierre Melville shot it he did so with virtually no formal training in film making and , as a non-union member he employed other non-union members , specifically cinematographer Henri Decae , who went on to enjoy a distinguished career . Finally Melville did not shoot in studio conditions , filming the bulk of the action in author Vercors own home - the home in which , he had in fact written the novella which Melville adapted . The quality of the finished product is beyond dispute but the downside is that he gave the Cahiers crowd the idea that anyone could do it , thus indirectly Melville has to take the rap for foisting the untalented semi-amateur Godard on the world of film . That apart this is a stunning debut - Melville had previously shot only a short about a clown - with three ( Howard Vernan , Nicole Stephane and Jean-Marie Robain ) exceptional performances , all the more so because the latter two speak less than a dozen words between them . Later Melville returned to the Resistance with L'Armee des ombres , arguably the finest film about the Resistance ever made and taken together they make formidable viewing .
410239	2567136	67108	9.0	Ham On Ruy	Writing yet another screenplay for her father , Gerard Oury , Daniele Thompson went to Victor Hugo's Ruy Blas , used it for a door-stop and fashioned a glorious romp out of it ( incidentally her own third film as writer-director , Fauteuils d'orchestre , opens in Paris next month and I for one can hardly wait ) . There's one sad note surrounding the production ; the great comedian Bourvil had signed to play opposite Louis de Funes but shortly after completing a straight role ( as Andre Bourvil ) in Le Cercle Rouge he died and was replaced by his co-star in Cercle , Yves Montand , switching from drama to slapstick comedy without missing a beat . This movie has all the elements of that Dreadful word we mustn't mention in the groves of Academe or among that small , rapidly dwindling band of Godard buffs , Entertainment . Only see it if you want a good time and a laugh a minute .
409438	2567136	29604	9.0	This One Breaks Both Legs	This is a brilliant ensemble piece that more than holds up after seventy years . Trivia buffs will have a field day asking which movie finds Ann Miller and Giner Rogers dancing together but they are only a small part of a great cast that includes Eve Arden , Lucille Ball and Katie Hepburn . There's also a nice touch of irony when Hepburn , who had been a successful Broadway actress prior to going to Hollywood , has to come on like an amateur for plot purposes . Although radically altered from the stage version the film does retain the main setting , Foolights , the boarding-house for aspiring actresses which , on Broadway , comprised the principal set , the film , of course , allows us to accompany the girls to casting offices etc . This is absolutely first-rate entertainment and somewhere out there I hope there's a DVD with my name on it .
409677	2567136	464828	10.0	The Singer Not The Song	The London Film Festival is only three days old and already we've had the finest film , this one . Not that the pretentious pseuds who actually run the BFI will agree - if they did I'd be seriously frightened - even as I write they've probably got scouts out scouring the world for something from the Galapogas Islands shot from the point of view of a turtle and redolent with her inner torment as she watches her offspring being picked off by scavengers as they make for the sea but those of us who actually LIKE film as , dare I say it , Entertainment and think it is at its best exploring the Human Condition with tenderness , sensitivity , wit , etc will respond to this entry as positively as last night's packed audience i . e . with applause and cheers . It scored heavily at Cannes and on its release in France last month there was agreement amongst the critics and punters that this was Depardieu's best role in a long time and I am pleased to endorse that opinion . The problem with someone as versatile as Depardieu who can do anything is that he's frequently prevailed upon - and too often consents - to do Everything . Here he is inch perfect as a middle-aged third-rate singer - the English equivalent would be Vince Hill with charisma - making a living in clubs and discos and waging a war against karoake . It's a measure of his charm that his ex-wife , now his manager and living with a new partner , still loves him and watches over him like a mother . Short of a mid-life crisis he hits upon - both literally and figuratively - Cecile de France , half his age , a single mom and ' troubled ' as they say in the soaps . As a rule Cecile de France is asked to light up the screen with her faux Audrey Hepburn smile as she did so winningly in her last outing Danielle Thompson's brilliant Fauteuils d'orchestre but here she is allowed to do ' serious ' and save the smile for isolated moments which is , of course , doubly effective . At best the relationship is doomed and both parties know this deep down but the joy for the audience is how they get to that good place that we all covet . This is the kind of wonderful movie that those BFI mandarins probably used to love themselves when they were kids and thought that if they went to work for the BFI they'd be able to watch stuff like this all day long and get paid for it then , having joined , they realised that pleasure is no match for pretension . For film lovers only .
409808	2567136	405094	10.0	The Worst Years Of Our Lives	This film has just opened in London and I attended one of the first screenings . I wish I could add something to the whole host of superlatives made by previous posters . This is a truly awesome film , at the very least a mini masterpiece and possibly even a fully-fledged one . With the best will in the world people in the West can never really KNOW what it was like to live in a state of constant long-distance supervision but this film - made by a native of West Germany who , by definition , has never known it either - comes as close as any to making us privy to that sensation . All the credits are impeccable from Writing , Directing down to the smallest ' extra ' and it is wonderful to see Martina Gedeck , so great as Bella Martha , and Sebastian Koch , equally good in Black Book , once more but excellent as both are they are outshone by Ulrich Muhe as the Stasi official charged with monitoring their lives . Weighing in at a little over two hours and with no sex or violence to speak of the film nevertheless rivets the attention by - if not in spite of - the very grayness which informs it with Muhe , himself a victim of Stasi surveillance , outstanding as he mutates from automaton to human being but totally from WITHIN ( no dramatic histrionics here to symbolize his volte-face , just acting of the most subtle kind ) . A film incapable of being overpraised and one that should be seen by every discerning film-goer .
409958	2567136	41587	10.0	Three On A Match	Another 5 star entry from Mank ( in passing could I point out that it was Joe's older brother Herman who co-wrote Citizen Kane with Awesome and not Joe himself as at least one poster seems to think ) and what irony that the actress who steals everything that isn't nailed down , the great Thelma Ritter , isn't even Credited . Unquestionably one of the best writers in Hollywood Mank sets the scene with his usual efficiency via the voice-over of the unseen catalyst Addie Ross ( voiced by Celeste Holm who would have a featured role in Mank's standout follow up All About Eve , as would Ritter ) who shows us first the town and then five of the six principals . Although Mank can't take credit for the premise - it was adapted from a published source - he surely put a generous amount of top spin on it ; in a nutshell the unseen narrator kick-starts the story proper via a letter written jointly to three of her married friends stating that she has run off with one of their husbands . The letter is delivered as the three wives embark on a pleasure boat at the start of a day trip for under-privileged children which means that each has plenty of time to reflect on her respective marriage , all of which are prime candidates for Addie to sever . Mank being Mank he has already shown us the cracks in the first two marriages ; in the first - and weakest - Jeffrey Lynn is leaving on a business trip and warns his wife , Jeanne Crain , that he may be away overnight ; in the second Kirk Douglas behaves out of character by wearing a suit on a Saturday , something which is not noticed by his wife , Ann Southern , until Jeanne Crain points it out to her . These scenes precede the receipt of the letter so that only in retrospect do we realize how masterfully Mank has crafted his story . He disliked Jeanne Crain intensely yet was forced to use her again later by the studio in People Will Talk opposite Cary Grant . As noted the Lynn-Crain pairing is the weakest of the three but because the other two - Ann Southern / Kirk Douglas , Linda Darnell / Paul Douglas are so strong we're prepared to tolerate Lynn and Crain . One of the revelations is Darnell , largely used as cheesecake because of her undeniable good looks but here given some acidic one-liners by Mank she lobs them unerringly where they will do the most good . Connie Gilchrist also weighs in with strong support as Darnell's mother whilst Paul Douglas has seldom been better . As a writer himself Mank throws a lot of his better lines to Kirk Douglas , playing a dedicated schoolteacher who despises commercial radio which is a shame because his wife , Southern , writes for it . All in all this is a great movie full of wit , charm , great writing and direction so what are you waiting for , get down to Blockbuster on the double .
409959	2567136	48104	10.0	With Old Waves Like This Who Needs New or : Eat Your Heart Out , Godard	Class , Style , Brilliance Is Alive And Well - or at least it was in 1952 when top writer Henri Jeanson collaborated with top director Julian Duvivier on this Faberge egg of a movie which incredibly provided the basis for the dire Paris When It Sizzles a decade later . On paper the premise is simple ; two scriptwriters who have run up against censor trouble improvise a new scenario on the hoof and we cut between the actual brainstorming / dictating to clips of what will be the finished product which switches genres on a dime . Jeamson's script is lethally funny and laced liberally with Billy Wilder-type mordant wit and all hands acquit themselves with more than distinction . This reaffirms Duvivier's place in the pantheon of not just great French directors but Great directors period . Unmissable .
410063	2567136	43362	10.0	The English Disease	This is , quite simply , the Best One-Act play ever written , any time , any place ; it's a Faberge egg with a Swiss movement and the fact that as I write , June , 2005 , a French translation has just picked up a couple of Molieres is indicative of its wider appeal . It was Terence Rattigan who first identified and named the ' English Disease ' as repression and he explored it in play after play such as Separate Tables and this one . A consummate scriptwriter as well as a Dramatist Rattigan handled his own adaptation and though he ' opened it out ' a little he still maintains the tension and his dramatic skill is evident in every frame . Michael Redgrave is simply magnificent as the repressed Andrew Crocker-Harris , so much so , that he makes the excellent supporting actors , Jean Kent , Nigel Patrick , Wilfrid Hyde White , etc seem merely competent . This is a film that cannot be praised too highly
409448	2567136	47437	10.0	The Wilder Shores Of Love	It seems to be not just stating but over stating the obvious to say yet again that Billy Wilder was a writing-directing genius , that Audrey Hepburn was not only drop-dead gorgeous but also a gifted actress , that Bogie and Bill Holden were consummate professionals who were virtually strangers to bad performances but I'm being constantly reminded that there are people reading these Boards whose parents may not have been born in the era when Sabrina was made and I guess you could argue that those of us a tad longer in the tooth have some kind of moral obligation to discuss artistes whose work is now becoming available on DVD in an effort to help them distinguish the wheat from the chaff . Virtually all the books about Wilder - and possibly Hepburn and Bogie as well - mention the tension on the set between lone wolf Bogie and cosy threesome Wilder , Holden and Hepburn and the amazing thing is that this doesn't show on screen . Wilder makes a big thing out of the fact that the ' Baron ' - an outstanding cameo by Marcel Dalio - is making souffles at Hepburns Cooking School in Paris as if to reinforce what he ( Wilder ) himself is doing from beginning to end in this delightful confection . Everyone was on top of their game and boy , does it show . This is one of those films that no one should even DREAM of remaking because that's like trying to reconstitute as an adult a snowflake that enchanted you as a child . Untouchable , unmissable . As another poster said , this is why we go to the movies , for moments like this . Magic .
409831	2567136	29706	10.0	Shadow Waltz	This is one of the Great ones : In terms of French cinema in the first full decade of Sound it belongs right up there with Marius , Fanny , Cesar , Quai des Brumes , Le Jour se leve , La Femme du boulanger , La Grande Illusion and you can't put anything higher than that though Duvivier's own La Belle equipe and Pepe Le Moko both come within a whisker . It's the kind of film that would be difficult to make today as would , for example , Dial M For Murder . Frederick Knott wrote Dial as a play in the early fifties and the Hitchcock film version was released in 1954 BUT the entire plot ( our old friend the ' perfect ' murder ) hinged on the fact that in those days only the upper and middle classes had telephones at all and those were in fixed locations and in this era of jack points and cell phones the idea of someone obliged to answer a telephone located on a desk in front of heavy drapes behind which a murderer was lurking ready to strike when the phone was answered would be ludicrous . Carnet is similar inasmuch as ' dance cards ' are unheard of today belonging as they do to a world of stately dancing and courtly manners where even a ' nice ' girl would as soon turn up to a dance totally naked as without a ' full ' dance card - many of us will remember how , in Meet Me In St Louis , Judy Garland and Lucille Bremner ' marked ' the dance card of an out-of-towner loading it with every dead-beat in town . So , yes , it is archaic but fortunately those of us who care to can have archaic and eat it courtesy of the Art / Revival House , Movie Channels on TV and / or the DVD . Living by a lake a widow comes face to face with what today we would call a mid-life crisis ; vaguely melancholic and slightly wistful lest she did , as she suspects , marry the wrong man , she allows her thoughts to drift to her first dance and the names on her very first dance card who , on a whim , she decides to trace . WE know of course that you can't go home again even if we've never even heard of Tom Wolfe let alone read him but thankfully Christine feels otherwise . It was a nice touch to find that the first name on the card is dead - but try telling that to his mother , the great Francoise Rosay - as if to say right from the word go that love dies , baby , if you neglect it . One by one via a night-club semi racketeer , a monk , a ski instructor , the mayor of a small town , an epileptic doctor with a lucrative sideline in abortion and a gay hairdresser the scales fall and / or are stripped from her eyes leaving her sadder but wiser . Some of the top names in French cinema step up to the plate , Harry Baur , Louis Jouvet , Fernandel etc and no one strikes out . Henri Jeanson and Julien Duvivier brought honour to the French cinema with this one that remains a must-see and before I sign off let me acknowledge a genuine altruistic contributor to these boards who , with exceptional kindness , sent me not only this gem but seventeen others . Watch this space .
