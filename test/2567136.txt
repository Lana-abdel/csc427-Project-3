408991	2567136	42911	1.0	Dire Streets	There's only one comment on this title and it is by someone who , like my , loves French films , is contemptuous of the new wavelet and admires some of the same directors - Duvivier , Carne , Cayette , Tourneur etc . On the other hand we do on occasion see things differently usually when one of us is with disappointed and the other finds pleasure in a given title . This is both understandable and explainable inasmuch as one of us live in a France whose television provides access to a regular stream of the best French films of all vintages whilst the other lives in an England starved of French films . In the case of this title however we are in complete accord : This is dire , almost as bad as anything by Godard . Imagine a film crew penetrated the deepest jungles of Guyana , shot a documentary and left the equipment behind . The natives , cut off from civilization then stumbled on a routine rejected by the Marx Brothers in their first year in vaudeville and persuaded a group of failed burlesque comics to play in it . Multiply this by ten and you're still nowhere near the depths this plumbs .
409394	2567136	354848	2.0	What A Trial	Were I not so lion-hearted dross like this could turn me against French cinema completely . Somehow Christian Leigh has contrived to shoot something that is WORSE than Jean-Luc Godard or Peter Greenaway which is quite a trick . Leigh's idea of film-making is to let his camera linger on a given scene til it runs out of film . Take the scene in the hotel room . Beatrice Dalle is sitting and contriving to brood whilst remaining expressionless . Outside the window traffic passes . A chambermaid - played by Isabelle Huppert's daughter , Lolita Chammah - enters and proceeds to make the bed . From time to time she throws a glance at Dalle . Riveting . Or take the scene in ( presumably ) Dalle's apartment . This is all ultra-modern where even the curves seem angular and metallic . The style is IKEA 22nd century where bookcases are red metal blocks . Dalle begins packing about 3 , 000 books into , what else , large plastic containers . This is accompanied by what sounds like Michael Nyman aged five and just discovering dissonance . Elsewhere Leos Carax , Dominique Reymonde and Daniel Duval make cameo appearances . Watching this merde is a new way to grow old .
409401	2567136	60959	3.0	Dud Czech	I seem to be a lone dissenting voice in a chorus of approval . So be it . Whilst it seems clear that there is a strong satirical element at work here I have to confess that my knowledge of the political situation in what used to be called Czechoslovakia is non-existent so that all the barbs eluded me . On the other hand I had little problem with either Closely Observed Trains or The Firemen's Ball , both the work of Czech filmmakers and both satirical attacks on the political situation that prevailed at the time they were made . When I say I had no problem I don't wish to imply that I understood the satire but I do mean that the respective directors had included a sufficient ' entertainment ' element to make their films accessible to a non-Czech audience , something which Vera Chytilova has failed to do here - or at least as far as I am concerned . I rented this film on the strength of the favourable reviews I had read and I take no pleasure in disagreeing with the majority but , alas , I can find little if anything to praise .
409379	2567136	475331	3.0	Nice Flute , Shame About The Magic	Kenneth Branagh could well have subtitled his second turkey in as many weeks and his third this year The Cranes Are Flying for yes , folks , our Ken has discovered a thing that you can mount the camera on and it will then climb in the air and allow you to shoot the film from the point of view of a cloud and that's his angle of choice for a good 30 per cent of the running time ; if this was a ploy to detract from his lack of ideas then it doesn't work and only draws attention to the pretentiousness on display . It's got to be a prime gobbler when Liz Smith pointedly excludes it from her CV and presumably asked for her name to be removed from the credits . Stephen Fry has the chutzpah to take a bow for the lyrics ; it's patently obvious that he has never heard of Cole Porter , Lorenz Hart , Frank Loesser , etc , let alone studied them , in fact if it comes to that he hasn't even bothered to study a Rhyming Dictionary and is clearly a paid-up member of the Kiss My Assonance School Of Lyric Writing . Branagh himself is clearly an advocate of the If It Ain't Broke , Break It , brigade for having set Shakespeare in Japan earlier in the year he now sets Mozart in the First World War but not the one you may have seen in the newsreels where the trenches were furnished with a melange of mud and rats ; you could EAT off the floors of these trenches and though he allows an occasional rifle shot for authenticity infantrymen topple over without so much as a scratch let alone any of that nasty blood . This doesn't leave a lot on the positive side ; okay , the singers Mime effectively enough , they are , after all , mostly trained opera singers but apart from that there's a two-hour gap where the film should be .
409871	2567136	56467	4.0	Deadly Affairs	There's clearly a lot of mileage in the seven deadly sins as the several film versions testify . There was a half-decent version in 1952 , ten years earlier than this entry , one that had the advantage of talents like Michele Morgan going for it . It's hard to find anything to like here ; certainly not the Godard segment which is a bigger joke than his breakthrough movie Brainless . In that one he followed Jean-Paul Belmondo with a hand-held camera as he walked up the Champs Elysee and back down again . Anxious to show how far he has come on this time he follows Eddie Constantine as he Drives from the Billancourt studios into Paris proper . Some progress . Elsewhere we have the one about the group of students who pool their resources so that one of them can get laid by a top-of-the-range hooker , a bizarre piece about flies in the soup leading to Armageddon , a Biter Bit episode and other unimaginative segments . Basically it's a waste of sprocket holes .
409540	2567136	61398	4.0	Barnum & Bailey Won't You Please Come Home	It's a truth universally acknowledged that to bring out star quality you need star opposition ; put Roger Federer in with Rafael Nadal and he'll pull out that little something extra , put him in with Tim Henman and he'll phone it in . As it is with athletes so it is with actors , put Joan Crawford up against Bette Davis and she'll raise her game but surround her with the cream of second and third rate British film actors and she can hardly be bothered to offer a Masterclass in how the Big Girls do it . Throw in a plot that would give Morons From Outer Space a run for its money and ain't nobody from this production gonna be looking for the mailman come Oscar nomination time - let's face it , this one is gonna have a tough time getting nominated for the Golden Turkey . This is the kind of film where a guy who travels with a circus wears a suit and tie and given this dress sense it's not so surprising that this guy ( Michael Gough if anyone asks you ) not only wanders into the Big Top in the middle of the night for no apparent reason other than to smoke a cigarette and THEN chooses to lean nonchalantly against the very spot where a VERY NASTY person is waiting to drive a spike right through his head , quite a trick given the strength required and ludicrous when the killer turns out to be someone who weighs about two ounces less than a lemon soufflé ' . Crawford is watchable , just about , but the likes of Diana Dors and Ted - who - told - him - he - could - act - Lune are frankly embarrassing . Definitely one to miss .
409159	2567136	61075	4.0	Ten New Ways To Grow Old	Like the earlier version of Agatha Christie's novel this remake takes similar liberties with the ' perfect ' crime . Writing , Directing and Acting are all undistinguished and the cast is typical of low-budget product at the time ; a couple of one-time leading men on the way down , a couple of excellent character actors , a couple of recent flavour-of-the-month ephemerals and the obligatory ' pop ' singer . If any of them include this drek on the CVs they are indeed desperate . The story is familiar both to Christie readers and film buffs who saw the first version so basically all that is new is the setting , now a château reachable only by cable car in place of an island off the English coast . Ten wooden indians congregate in reel # 1 , two wooden indians are left at the end . There will be a paint-drying watch at Tuesday's matinée . Be there , it has this beat six ways from the middle .
409067	2567136	40175	4.0	Oh ! Luna Rossa	I never heard of this film til it played as part of a Robert Mitchum retrospective at the National Film Theatre in London . Almost 60 years on the cast list looked tasty to say the least with seven names - in addition to top-billed Mitchum - in the public domain ; Charles McGraw , not long off The Killers , Barbara Bel Geddes , long before Dallas and arguably still better known as the daughter of Theatre Set Designer Norman , Walter Brennan , who needed no introduction , Frank Faylen , the sadistic male nurse in The Lost Weekend and the much nicer small-town mensch in It's A Wonderful Life , Robert Preston still a decade away from Harold Hill in The Music Man with Tom Tully and Phyllis Thaxter making up the numbers . Alas , most of them were wasting their time . I looked in vain for any ' signature ' scenes given that it was Robert Wise on bullhorn . By this time he'd made around a half dozen films and had still to find a style . The story is our old friend the range war and Mitchum must have thought it was barely a cut above the Hopalong Cassidy oaters on which he'd cut his teeth . There are no new twists - if you don't count the unbelievable scene when Mitchum accuses Preston of sleeping with Thaxter to gain information about her father's plans to move his cattle . This is perfectly true but how did Mitchum KNOW ? We've seen or heard nothing to indicate how he discovered it . On balance not a lot to be said for this .
409926	2567136	19486	5.0	Fight The Good Fight	One is tempted to give this a high grade just for surfacing in what is apparently a severely abridged print . By some miracle what survives is a story that has a clearly definable beginning , middle and end and the initial conclusion is that anything up to one hour's superfluous ' padding ' has been jettisoned / lost . The main thrust of the plot - the conflict between Catholics and Protestants in a France presided over by Catherine de Medici - is a sort of La Reine Margot-lite without the benefit of a Daniele Thompson screenplay . If it were possible to judge it according to 1928 standards it's not unlikely that it would score a higher rating but other than that the main interest is as an early work of Jean Renoir .
409480	2567136	41737	5.0	Pardon My French	I'm guessing that at the time this film was made the Welsh Nationalists with their penchant for turning signposts around to confuse English tourists were more or less inactive but now that a national newspaper in England is giving away several vintage Ealing comedies dating from the forties / fifties it's possible to read Tibby Clarke's screenplay as a satire on those misguided , hot-headed Taffs . Like the same stable's Hue and Cry London bomb-sites are a feature of this feature and it does arguably serve a function as living history although it's reasonable to suppose that much of it was shot in the studio . It's not so much difficult as virtually impossible to accept that a world like this ever existed , not so much the whimsical ' plot ' as the lifestyles which are totally alien to anything we know today . If you're fairly undemanding and of a mind to time-travel to another galaxy then this may well hit the spot .
409280	2567136	59263	5.0	Heavy Water-Lite	Twenty years after the end of the war they were still churning out stuff like this , more or less scraping the bottom of the barrel for ' unknown ' incidents to exploit . The events depicted here may well have been true but Anthony Mann does little or nothing to inject any life or excitement into things . For me the attraction was third-billed Michael Redgrave but he was totally wasted in a part even Richard Pascoe couldn't make more lifeless . For a film about heavy water there's a notable lack of chemistry between ANY one person and ANY one else ; an ' action ' film short on action , a thriller short on thrills in fact the whole thing is a snow job .
409645	2567136	443159	5.0	Spick and Spanish ? Not really	First-time director has a reasonable track record as a writer with Life Is A Long Tranquil River and Tatie Danielle among her credits and I suppose she takes a decent stab at it but ultimately it's a disappointment . Trivia-buffs will note that director Bob Swaim ( Le Balance ) makes an appearance and when you're reduced to saying things like that you know you're in trouble . Gad Elmalah , who , incredibly , is a ' name ' in France , plays the Spanish-born chauffeur to tycoon Francois Veber - a little too close to FranCIS Veber for comfort - Depardieu and the pair are not so much master-and-servant as buddies , as are their wives . Ramon's wife is also Spanish and has a yen to return to Spain so when he pretends not to understand English when driving a business acquaintance of Veber's to an appointment the man feels able to speak freely about stock-market activity and before you can say Dow Jones the chauffeur is rolling in the green stuff and has a villa in Spain . And that's about it . A few humorous moments , Sabine Azema with not much to do as Madame Veber but doing it professionally as you'd expect . Let's say pleasant and leave it at that .
409040	2567136	450615	5.0	Dilute To Taste	On paper this might have seemed viable or even plausible ; two very different types of men thrown together by circumstance and embroiled in a ' caper ' , just the sort of thing in fact that Francis Veber does with one hand behind his back . Alas , this is a Francis Veber type film sans Francis Veber so that the result is more embarrassment than laffs . For me Michele Laroque was a major selling point but though prominent on the billing and publicity she has what amounts to a cameo as a bank official . Somehow Daniel Auteuil and Clovis Cornillac , neither naturally comic , fail to spark as a team so that Gerard Depardieu and Pierre Richard can rest easy . The plot won't stand scrutiny under a strong light so I won't subject it to one , suffice it to say that Cornillac is called upon to portray an aristocrat-cum-spy whilst Auteuil weighs in as an interpreter who seizes the chance to exploit the ' expenses ' aspect of a new assignment . For reasons best known to the Producers Tim Piggot-Smith , Jennifer Saunders and John Cleese are also on hand and probably wish they weren't . If you think Mr Bean is funny this'll kill you , otherwise do yourself a favor and watch Double Jeopardy .
409408	2567136	67952	5.0	The Fall Of Little Voice	Just about the only selling-point for this film was Richard Burton and his magnificent voice so to hear him attempting - and missing by a mile - a cockney accent and effectively strangling his outstanding timbre needed something really exceptional - like a non-hackneyed plot - to offset the disappointment . This is another effort that may well have seemed fine had you seen it in 1971 but withing a couple of years The Sweeney was doing everything seen here that much better so that to watch it for the first time today is to find it highly risible despite the normally reliable writing team of Clements and LeFrenais who were really better at small screen comedy than large screen drama . Burton is , of course , always worth seeing but is still only one step away from total embarrassment which , alas , is more than can be said for Donald Sinden , Ian McShane and Joss Ackland . One to avoid .
409573	2567136	35403	5.0	Johnny Wrong Note	I'm not really qualified to criticize this entry on grounds of accuracy as my knowledge of Hector Berlioz himself , the musical climate in which he was active and the period in general leaves much to be desired but the same , alas , can be said for this film in terms of the grounds on which I do feel more or less qualified to venture an opinion i . e . writing , acting , direction etc . Christian Jaques was more at home in other genres and whilst Jean-Louis Barrault was a fine actor - and would score heavily three years later in Les Enfants du paradis - he seems ill at ease in the main role . Neither Catherine Fonteney , Bernard Blier or Jules Berry are exactly chopped live but even then can do little to rescue this .
409782	2567136	362246	5.0	A Myth Is As Good As A Mille	Other than good , bad or indifferent it's difficult to classify this one . Okay , it's based on a Myth so the director needs to find modern equivalents but this still leaves unanswered questions . Number one must be why Laurent Lucas picked this particular hooker to kidnap . There's no indication that they had met previously and by extension that Laurent would know Tiresia was a pre-op transsexual . Number two , why do none of her hooker colleagues come looking for her and / or report her missing ; given the precarious nature of sex-with-strangers it's reasonable to suppose that hookers write down and / or memorise the numbers of the cars they and their colleagues get into . Number three , where does Lucas get his money ? He appears to have no job yet lives in a large several storey house - albeit dilapidated - and drives a car without a visible source of income . To these can be added others such as what , if any symbolic meaning has the hedgehog in Laurent's garden which he is constantly feeding and why - other than the fact that it fits the original myth - does he opt to blind Tiresia rather than killing her outright or breaking say an arm or a leg . Then we can throw in why does Laurent double the role of a priest in the second half of the film . Though I kept watching til the end these and other questions punctuated the viewing throughout , not the best sign for a filmmaker whose objective surely is to make you forget you're watching a film .
409001	2567136	33868	5.0	Souls At Sea	No doubt influenced by the success of Pygmalion producer / director Gaby Pascal followed up three years later with a second GBS polemic masquerading as a play , in this case that old chestnut God versus Mammon best out of three , Major Barbara . Wendy Hiller had scored a personal triumph as Eliza Doolittle in Pygmalion so here she is again as the eponymous Salvation Army lass whose father happens conveniently to be a munitions manufacturer . One of the problems with Shaw in this vein is that he tended to animate cyphers rather than create flesh-and-blood characters and here a group of actors from stage and screen do what they can with what they are given to work with . There's little discernible chemistry between Hiller and Rex Harrison , Robert Morley pays homage to Charles Laughton , Emlyn Williams phones it in and it's left to stage actress Marie Lohr to provide a touch of class . Elsewhere Bobby Newton offers a prototype Bill Sikes ( possibly encouraged by Editor David Lean who also gets a co-director credit . Stanley Holloway gets a strangely long opening sequence for an uncredited role and in her film debut Deborah Kerr gives little indication of the durable career to come . A curio more than anything else .
409436	2567136	362015	5.0	Three For The Showdown	This was one of two TV versions made in the same year ( 2003 ) of the old Cocteau warhorse and the best we can give it is that is has three of the best French actors on board in the shape of Jeanne Moreau , Nicole Garcia and Francois Berleand . I suppose it's not too difficult to see the attraction in this story of a mother's incestuous love for a son who in turn is in love with a girl who , unknown to him , is his father's mistress and let's not forget the faithful Aunt , once herself in love with the father yet standing nobly aside in favour of her sister . The three actors named are more than up to snuff and the claustrophobic atmosphere is well captured but ultimately the film has nothing new to add to previous versions .
410089	2567136	86551	5.0	Sunday , Bloody Sunday	I don't know just how ill Truffaut was when he shot this , his last film , but I'd guess extremely . It's understandable that he'd want to throw a film to Fanny Ardant given that they were an item and had a child together and whilst I certainly have no quarrel with Ardant getting the lion's share of any movie I wish she could have found something better than this melange . It's almost as if Truffaut had a perverse desire to return to the clumsiness of his early black and white efforts which made little pretense to professionalism . Here we're asked to stomach the fact that a man ( Jean-Louis Trintignant ) wanted for murder would be able to hide out in his own Real Estate office almost indefinitely whilst his secretary ( Ardant ) is out solving the crime whilst the police fail even to stake out his office . It's the kind of no-brainer where in the last reel having seen no prior evidence of it Ardant can say to Trintignant with a straight face that she's been madly in love with him all along . See it for Ardant .
409828	2567136	66181	6.0	My Future Just Passed	It would be easy to dismiss this as The Three Faces Of Eve with songs but it is , actually , a little more than that . Alan Lerner had a lifelong interest in ESP and toyed with the idea of basing a musical on it for years before finally getting around to it in the mid sixties more or less a full decade after My Fair Lady . The Broadway version failed to find its audience but was jam-packed with great numbers ( Lerner was again working with Burton Lane with whom he wrote one of the all-time great ballads , ' Too Late Now ' for the MGM movie Royal Wedding ) most of which the producers have seen fit to jettison leaving the leading man only three numbers but the film is , nevertheless , interesting if only for the chance to see and hear the great Montand working in English . Montand , who learned English late in life , made several films in the English language none of them really satisfactory and whilst at one level the antipathy of most of the posters here is understandable one can't help feeling they are lacking in sensitivity inasmuch as the charm and shining talent of the man are obvious even in a vehicle tailored to his co-star as is this . Streisand is certainly adequate and with Minnelli at the helm she is both costumed and photographed to full advantage but by 1970 sophisticated lyrics like those in What Did I Have were wasted on if not bewildering to an audience educated in punk rock . Despite what the nay-sayers think Montand was worth every dime of the ( for the time ) silly money that enticed him to cross the Atlantic . Maybe not one to buy ( unless you rate even minor Montand as I do ) but certainly one to rent .
409546	2567136	457430	6.0	Finding Neverland	The Symbolistas are going to have a field day with this one to say nothing of the Referentialist . From the Peter Pan reference in the title to the Tinker Bell-like fairy who makes initial contact with the heroine to the almost too numerous to mention Alice In Wonderland nods - the descent into an alternative world , keys , food and drink with magical properties etc to the nod to the Carne-Prevert Les Portes de la nuit ( both films take place just after a war and impose a fantasy onto post-war reality ) though Pan's labyrinth , unlike Portes , has been received almost ecstatically in some quarters whilst Portes initially bombed only to be ' reassessed ' into the masterpiece it is when neither Carne nor Prevert had enjoy vindication . There are plenty of good things here but leave us not lose our heads Mark Kermode style . Every competent , well-written , well-acted , well-made film isn't another Citizen Kane or Les Enfants du paradis , if it were then Kane and Enfants would soon be debased . This remains a good movie , a tad unusual to be sure but neither is that worthy in itself of elevation to All-Time Great status . See it by all means , enjoy it even , but keep in mind that it's only a movie , Ingrid .
409485	2567136	103190	6.0	Portrait Of The Artist . . .	The problem with making a biopic of an artist is the temptation to compose every frame as a painting ; Vincente Minnelli already had this tendency so he was a logical choice to make Lust For Life , which I've yet to see . No one ever accused Maurice Pialet of either artistic or poetic tendencies given his predilection for the in-yer-face School of Film-making but he does succumb to the urge from time to time in this . . . well WHAT exactly is a good question . It chooses to record only the final weeks in the life of Vincent Van Gogh , from his arrival at Auvers until he killed himself a few weeks later . Jacques Dutronc is not a natural actor to portray a passionate , tortured artist and Kirk Douglas was a much more obvious choice - though not having seen Lust For Life I am unable to comment on how well he justified his casting - being cool and cerebral , the ideal qualities for his role in , for example , Merci pour le chocolate . To be fair to Pialat I doubt if he was interested in seducing the viewer with pretty compositions or logical storytelling and his period research is pretty nigh faultless as are the performances particularly Bernard Le Coq as Theo . On balance this is a movie that needs to find its audience with little or no help from the director .
409359	2567136	39306	6.0	Crime Without Passion	The ' perfect crime ' novel , play , film became so ubiquitous that audiences tended to judge them on how credible the ' flaw ' that proved the murderer's undoing and in this case it would struggle to rate . Director Arthur Crabtree began behind the camera where he had credits on the like of Waterloo Road ; he never really made it as a director but this effort begins well enough , boldly even for the time , because we are not told where Eric Portman has been prior to his entering his ( we assume ) flat , discovering several business cards signed Love Always and decides to confront and kill the sender . Only then does Portman reveal to Dennis Price that he has been in America for six months thus leaving Price clear to bed Portman's wife , Greta Gynt . He cons Price into writing a letter to Gynt that we - seasoned viewers of ' perfect crime ' movies - spot as a suicide note , then coolly offs Price but before he can leave Gynt ( who has a key , comes in with new lover , Maxwell Reed . This gives Portman a chance to frame Price for the crime and the ' flaw ' comes when Gynt tells Portman she has loved him all along and begs him to clear Price without , of course , incriminating himself . HE AGREES . Yeah , you heard ; a man who has found incriminating evidence of one lover ( Price ) and has had it confirmed by Price himself , then sees and hears with his own eyes and ears how Gynt behaves with a second lover , BELIEVES he pathetic story . There is absolutely no chemistry between Gynt and any of the three men ( though to be fair we never see her with Price ) , Reed is as wooden as always and Jack Warner walks through the detective role , possibly mistaking it for the one he played in It Always Rains On Sunday that same year . On a Saturday night in 1947 at the local Odean this would have been perfectly acceptable . Sixty years on it leaves something to be desired .
409167	2567136	499592	6.0	Mills Bomb ? Not Really	It's doubtful if this propaganda short has seen the light of day since it's initial release but it was both interesting and informative to catch up with it as part of a mini-season of Jessie Matthews at the NFT . It's very much in the area of the Crown Film Unit , The Turners Of Prospect Road etc and seen today it tips its glove from Frame # 1 but it's also undeniable that its heart was in the right place and Matthews reveals a deft hand behind the camera . John Mills put in service time on film in all three branches of the Armed Forces and here he's seen in khaki as the soldier home for a brief leave in which he marries his sweetheart , Dulcie Gray and returns to duty . Matthews covers a lot of territory in two reels from the opening library shots of troopships arriving in port , reunions across the spectrum of class , rank , then in to Mills , telephoning his mum then walking down his bomb-damaged street , enjoying his first home-cooked meal as mother , Beatrice Varley supplies an economic back story of sweetheart Dulcie Gray , to whom he has stopped writing , believing erroneously that she had found another man . This sets up the reunion outside the factory where Gray is working , a resumption of the courtship culminating in the wedding with the anti climax of Mills returning to duty . Of course Mills and Gray are symbols and of course the whole thing is a metaphor and of course Noel Coward could do it better and did at least twice ( In Which We Serve and This Happy Breed , both of which featured Mills ) but there's a lovely wistful charm about the piece and a glimpse of what made England so great and a place where English people would want to live as well as a terrible reminder of how much Tony Blair has destroyed .
409632	2567136	407131	6.0	Playing With Fire	In Greek legend Prometheus stole fire from the Gods and laid it on Man . For this he was chained to a rock and each evening an eagle would peck out his liver . It may help to know that before watching this film . On the other hand . . . Clearly there's a metaphor in there somewhere and Marcel L'Herbier - who made the wonderful La Nuit Fantastique some twenty years later - has pounced on it and tells a tale of a financier who ' borrows ' rather than perhaps ' steals ' money from the Bourse and lays it on his clients . Naturally it all ends in tears because financiers nearly always have personal secretaries who are only human and often have a little larceny going for them in spots and if there's woman in the frame one shudders to think of what might happen . For 1921 this is a fine effort and worth catching up with .
409027	2567136	457495	6.0	Storm In A Stryofoam Cup	This will probably do well with its target audience and it certainly passes 90 minutes relatively painlessly . However if you don't do Referential then it may not be for you . Bill Goldman , a far better writer than the author of this series , created in Marathon Man a fairly bland , mild character who idolised his older brother and was sublimely unaware of said brother's involvement with the CIA until , inevitably , the brother got killed in the line of duty . Here the older brother becomes an uncle , similarly idolised and similarly killed in the line of duty ; 007 references also abound not least in the final reel when an Oriental guy hitherto never seen is charged by the heavy with guarding the premises and , confronted by our hero and seemingly for no apparent reason other than the cause of the ' in ' joke , throws his hat away ; Stephen Fry weighs in as the local ' Q ' headquartered in a concealed room in Hamley's ; elsewhere there are several what may be best described as James Bond-lite one-liners and let's not forget the millionaire madman and his plan to destroy and / or dominate . The director could use some serious lessons in shooting action and Damien Lewis seems bent on flaunting the Honors Degree he secured at the Dick Van Dyke School of Accents in fact I can't recall the last time I heard such a pathetic attempt at a foreign accent . . . wait , I tell a lie , it was Van Dyke himself in Mary Poppins lo those many moons ago . Bill Nighy acts like he has a fig up his ass but chances are these were his instructions from the director . As I said above the ninety minutes or so pass fairly painlessly and I suppose that's all you could ask of a summer movie .
410042	2567136	171343	6.0	Early Autumn	Definitely not for the short attention-span set . This takes its own sweet time to get anywhere and even then you're not quite sure where it's taken you . It kicks off with a long opening sequence resembling nothing more than a pre-war black and white documentary on traditional wine-growing in Georgia and I may as well state my ignorance up front , I didn't even know that Georgia HAD a wine-growing industry but I'm guessing they don't export too much of it . The screening I attended was introduced by the director who advised us not to read the subtitles and , to a great extent , the film can be followed just by watching it . If it has a central character it is Nico , a teenager who gets a job in a wine-collective ( if that's the correct term ) and subsequently decides that one of the new barrels is undrinkable and ensures it will not be bottled by adding gelatin to the barrel . That's about it apart from a slight sub-plot involving a possessive bully and two giggling girls . I'm glad I saw it but I'm not sure I'd want to sit through it again .
409761	2567136	41640	6.0	Mr Bland Builds His Dreams	A previous poster said it all and succinctly ; Carne sans Prevert is like Rodgers without Hart . Of course no film that stars Jean Gabin , features Louis Seigner ( grandfather of Emmanuelle and Mathilde ) and is directed by Marcel Carne could ever be totally bad it's just that the potential for greatness has been missed . Another poster made the pertinent remark that when Georges Simenon abandons the subject of murder / crime his books - and by extension the films made from them - tend to be duller . What we have here is a protagonist ( Gabin ) around fifty or so , owner of a bar / restaurant / club and a cinema and an eye for the ladies . As is to be expected Carne frames his shots in an interesting way and the black and white photography makes for some reasonable light-and-shadow effects but there's not a lot more than that on offer .
409353	2567136	437526	6.0	Catherine Wheels ( And Deals )	Up to now Catherine Breillat has been unashamedly up-front in a series of modern day medium-core pornographic movies . It seems a little late in the day to seek respectability by setting the graphic couplings in a period setting but that essentially is what she's done . For French film buffs it's a joy to see people like Yolande Moreau and Michael Lonsdale in anything and Ann Parillaud and Amira Casar are not exactly chopped liver if anybody asks you . Breillat protégé Roxanne Mesquida is also on hand to take care of most of the sexual content and it has to be said that Breillat has shot a seriously sumptuous movie . Whether it is , however , anything more than a chocolate-box with soft-core centres is moot .
410280	2567136	47580	6.0	Cream Soda Fountain	Rome was flavor of the month in fifties Hollywood ; Paramount wound up with a mega hit sleeper on its hands when the romantic chemistry between Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday proved both a commercial and critical success . Hollywood minds are , of course , geared to spin-off potential ; if One romance in black and white could rake in the dough think how much more could be made out of THREE in Technicolor . More than half a century later the response is pretty much ho hum but in the first half of the fifties a combination of the finest male singer of the twentieth century singing ( albeit uncredited ) a catchy title song over a series of tourist views of Rome predisposed audiences to like whatever came next however hackneyed . The sextet was interesting , Louis Jourdan wasn't even Italian but then neither was Clifton Webb , though Jourdan did personify the handsome Leading Man . Maggie MacNamara was the most interesting of the females but made only five films in total and in one of those she was uncredited ; Jean Peters was arguably best known for becoming Mrs Howard Hughes in 1957 and retiring from the screen until the 70s and Dorothy McGuire was the best actress by a country mile . With a side trip to Venice thrown in this RomCom - a chick flick before the term was coined - couldn't miss and still has a novelty value for the easily pleased .
409121	2567136	52950	6.0	Cool Yul	I've only just caught up with this one so any ' cutting edge ' element it may have had at the time - it was made three years after those Russian tanks cut a swathe through Hungary - is long diluted and there is more interest in the cast - from Ron Howard in only his second film , to Gerard Oury who would direct the first of many fine movies the following year , to Ann Jackson , a fine stage actress who was sparing with he film work , to E . G . Marshall , another stage actor , one of the 12 Angry Men and starring on TV in The Defenders at the time this was shot , to Anouk Aimee , a fine French actress yet to go supernova with Un Homme et une femme to Jason Robards who'd made a film in 1946 and waited 13 years to do another , filling the years between with standout Broadway performances in The Iceman Cometh and Long Day's Journey Into Night . As has been noted George Tabori's screenplay owes more than a little to Maupassant's Boule de suif , which also formed the basis of Stagecoach and viewed today it's a pleasant enough diversion but little more .
409388	2567136	783233	6.0	Who's Sorry Now	There's a lovely irony at work here inasmuch as the bulk of the action takes place in the thirties / forties , an age when movies were made for the masses rather than a ' target ' audience but even a target audience is no longer sufficient so that today movies like this are what I choose to call Festival Fodder , where the director has one eye on the viewfinder and the other on the Golden Palm , Silver Bear , Bronze Ego Massager or whatever and whilst these films are certainly good for one viewing and attract lots of puffery from ' Arts ' programmes and Sunday supplements they seldom stand up to a second viewing a few years later ( hands up anyone who can sit through The English Patient again ) . Joe Wright , current critical flavor of the month , has turned out a decent enough movie and some of the trendiest names in the business - Knightley , McAvoy - are on hand to lend gravitas to the project but significantly the best acting by a country mile is contributed by Vanessa Redgrave at the very end of the movie - in another irony the character she plays is very similar to the one played by her father , Michael , in The Go-Between , i . e . youth grown old and bitter and filled with remorse for lives damaged in earlier decades - and as virtually all of it is shot in close up she has only her face , eyes , and voice to work with . Can you stand more irony ? You can , swell ; in the Dunkirk segment there's a brief clip from the Marcel Carne / Jacques Prevert Quai des Brumes , featuring Michele Morgan and Jean Gabin ( this is mistakenly referred to as Recif de Corail by IMDb ; Quai des Brumes was released in 1938 whilst Jean Gremillon's Recif de Corail was interrupted by the war and had not been completed by the time of Dunkirk ) a far , far superior film than Atonement and one that was made with both the director's eyes on entertaining the masses , come to think of it , Mr . Wright , THAT's how you make classics , by default rather than design .
409710	2567136	187474	6.0	School Of Thought	With the obvious exception of yet another Masterclass in Acting from Isabelle Huppert there isn't too much to enjoy here , at least on the surface . Huppert plays a real character , Madame Maintenon , initially the mistress and then the wife of Louis the Fourteenth who took it into her head to found a school - the Saint Cyr of the titles - to ' improve ' some 250 young girls selected from around one thousand applicants . One of the first tasks was to iron out provincial accents and aim for an Gallic equivalent of Received English and this is where the native French speakers have a bonus inasmuch as they can follow the progress from Regional to National accents whilst to those obliged to rely on subtitles the accents sound pretty much the same . There's other stuff going on here , not least the secular / religion conflict but it tends to be obtuse and there are too many ' five years later ' captions and not enough straightforward storytelling . Huppert fans will like it anyway but the rest may find it hard going .
409535	2567136	106226	6.0	Guilt On The Gingerbread	This is Scorcese anxious to prove he can do more than make movies about sub-humans like de Niro and Pesci competing to see who can say the f-word the most times in between killing and maiming other animals like themselves and on that level it more or less succeeds . Somewhere along the way he's clearly seen a Max Ophuls movie so we get lots of shots with the camera circling the action and making elegant swoops and fluid movements . Not bad as far as it goes , too bad Ophuls did it first . Joanne Woodward's voice-over narration hits the right note for Edith Wharton which is not always replicated by the actors . There's absolutely no chemistry between the two leads , Daniel Day-Lewis and Michelles Pfeiffer though Pfeiffer scores as someone who might easily captivate a man even as uptight as Day-Lewis . There are lots of stunning visuals all out of the right bottle and the pace is more or less right but ultimately it's shadow at the expense of substance .
408948	2567136	454602	6.0	It's All In The Game	I've heard of sport as a metaphor for life but this is ridiculous ; there's literally barely a frame in which two or more of the principals are not rowing , jogging , playing squash , golf , canoing or mountain climbing . It's all in the interests of our old friend the company ' bonding ' session and anyone who saw the play Neville's Island will know what to expect . For reasons best known to himself and / or the director Benoit Magimal is sporting red hair this time around ; Jean-Pierre Cassel is wheeled on possibly to bring a touch of class to the marquee but the two females , Marion Cotillard and Melanie Doutey both turn in ho-hum performances . If you like sport and / or power games then this is right down your rue but if not you may be sorry you went .
410156	2567136	53279	6.0	Sign Of The Times	Released in 1959 between Godard's Brainless and Truffaut's The Four Hundred Yawns this entry from Rohmer was right there as the first lappings of the New Wavelet dampened the feet of Real French Directors . Within three years the New Wave was washed up ; eventually Truffaut joined the opposition and made Le Dernier Metro completely in a style he had affected to despise and upon which he had poured vitriolic scorn but Godard never did find out how the Big Boys do it . Le Signe du Lion holds up much better than either Brainless or The Four Hundred Yawns and seen today - as it was , literally hours ago - it is valuable as a chronicle of Paris as it was on the edge of the 60s . The location shooting was , of course , dictated by the budget or lack of one but unlike Godard who allowed his camera to follow a Belmondo walking aimlessly and rapidly up and down the same thoroughfare Rohmer opts for a much more leisurely pace as befits his central character , who began by living from hand to mouth and slowly degenerates to fully paid-up bum . American expatriate Jess Hahn is effective as an essentially foolish man who lives for the moment , a grasshopper in a world of ants , happy to splash out all his borrowed money on fair-weather friends on the strength of a misinterpreted telegram and then paying the price as the real friends who may well have come through for him leave Paris on vacation and / or business . People born under Leo do , of course , have a predilection for being the centre of attention which serves as both an explanation and / or justification for Rohmer's camera being fixated on Hahn for something like one and three quarter hours . Along the way the likes of Paul Crauchet and Stephane Audran offer glimpses of the fine actors they would become whilst Godard , significantly , plays an idiot . For a director with a reputation for making ' talky ' movies Rohmer plays down his loquacity this time around and turns in an animated postcard of Paris .
408779	2567136	31334	6.0	Doesn't Deserve To Get The Bird	This is exactly the kind of Boy's Own Paper yarn that I'd walk a mile for a camel to take me away from . On the other hand most Boy's Own Paper yarns don't come complete with Ralph Richardson , an actor who automatically enhances any film he cares to grace with his presence . The English scenes are reasonably lavish , the actors portraying the English upper crust are reasonably wooden and June Duprez is beyond inadequate as the nearest thing to a leading lady . John Clemensts as Harry Faversham , coward turned hero is barely up to it and there are lots of extras playing Fuzzy Wuzzies which complement the fuzzy wuzziness of the whole enchilada . See it for Richardson .
409796	2567136	459666	6.0	The Worst Of Times	Charles Dickens once began a novel with ' It was the best of times , it was the worst of times ' and to these Western eyes the latter obtains here . It's a nice touch - though not exactly revolutionary - to have three sets of lovers in three time zones played by the same two actors , Chang Chen and Shu Qi but the third episode is SO out of kilter with the other two ( and they don't exactly complement each other ) that it totally negates all that has gone before and almost brutalizes the eye . In their different ways the first episode ( 1966 ) and the second ( 19ll ) have lots going for them stylistically . The first episode is almost a definition of oriental inscrutability and it is very difficult for a Western eye to comprehend that ANYTHING at all is going on between the man and the girl . Of course the very concept of a girl both working and participating in a snooker hall is alien to Europenas - or at least the English - especially in 1966 which was smack dab in the centre of the ' swinging sixties ' when girls were far more preoccupied with the pill , sexual freedom and the drug culture than something as ' old fashioned ' as snooker - but if we go along with it as normal in Taiwan there still remains the problem of the all-but-invisible nuances between the couple . The second part is much more stately and comes complete with the equivalent of Title Cards and an off-screen piano accompaniment and has been shot in a manner suggesting an old daguerrotype . By contrast the last segment is in-yer-face and seems to wallow in the worst excesses of modern culture where it is almost impossible to find even one character with whom we can empathize let alone SYMpathize . Those guys and gals who ' teach ' film at universities will be creaming in their pants but the rest of us will wonder what all the fuss is about .
409852	2567136	401445	6.0	Non Vintage	The English critics have more or less blasted this new release unanimously but I went anyway . I'm lion-hearted . And you know , it wasn't too bad . Sure , it owes something to Avanti and Ridley Scott is no Billy Wilder and Russell Crowe is definitely no Jack Lemmon but Marion Cotillard , soon to be seen as Edith Piaf , is more than a match for Juliet Mills . In their wisdom IMDb omit five actors from the initial cast list so that you have to click ' more ' to find out that Marion Cotillard , Abbie Cornish , Isabelle Candelier , Didier Bourdon and Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi are also part of the ensemble ; leading lady and love-interest Cotillard is arguably the largest omission but Candelier and Bourdon offer huge support throughout , Abbie Cornish is the Californian who turns up looking for her father whilst Bruni-Tedeschi is an avocat . It seems to be a truth universally acknowledged that Russell Crowe doesn't do Charm and / or light comedy but hey , he gives it the old college try and with support like that mentioned it's not such a big deal . It's basically a feel gooder with some great scenery punctuated by some Judge and Andy Hardy lessons in life with Finney in the Lewis Stone role and Crowe as Mickey Rooney but the two hours really do fly by .
409603	2567136	380689	7.0	Now It Can Be Tolled . . .	. . . and , like the man said , never ask for whom it tolls . This is alleged to be the 10th version of Les Liasons Dangerouse and I haven't seen any of the previous nine . The main thing I took away from this version was elegance , stateliness , formality . Not unusual of course in a film emanating from the Eastern hemisphere . What it is , in fact , is a Comedy of Manners in top-to-bottom writing and no worse for that . Like most occidentals Asian names don't exactly trip off my tongue so I won't attempt to name the actors who I thought were uniformly excellent . I did find it singular to say the least that the leading man whose prowess at martial arts had been amply demonstrated would turn his back on an opponent who might have been down but was far from out . Although I'm woefully ignorant of Eastern mores I do know enough to realize that Honour is prized above most things and a man who has just spoken about the shame his family suffered at the hands of the leading man is not going to give up until he draws his last breath . It's just about feasible that the leading man wished to die / be killed but in that case why has he just kicked seven kinds of s out of his opponent instead of succumbing gracefully to the first blow . Overall it's a chocolate-box of a movie like Marivaux in Mandarin .
409637	2567136	43955	7.0	Highly Strung	Though light on excitement this multi-directed ( five helmers in all were involved and that was before Hughes added his own once-over-lightly ) is strangely satisfying albeit it is more Detective Story than Kiss Of Death . If Ryan walks away with it and Mitchum allows him to do so it is rich in supporting players such as William Conrad and Ray Collins sweating his way through a de-clawed xerox of his ' Boss ' Jim Gettys in Orson's Citizen Kane . The times they are a changin ' and dinosaur Robert Ryan is a definite liability to the more white-collar mob with eyes to take over the nameless city . Mitchum's incorruptible cop is the white knight attempting to slay the dragon and that's about it plot-wise . Ryan appears to have been frightened by Widmark's Tommy Udo in Kiss Of Death even to the climactic murder in the precinct house . Overall worth a look .
409516	2567136	160513	7.0	( Bad ) Dream Weaver	Had this been made in the old days it would have been firmly labelled a ' woman's picture ' and possibly rated as a one , two , three or even four handkerchief weepie . Although someone old-fashioned in content it does benefit from excellent performances from the thee leads and whilst it's true that Sigourney Weaver gets the lion's share both emotion and emoting-wise both David Staithairn and Julianne Moore both support and match her . The story has married couple Stathairn and Weaver opting out of urban life for the joys of the country , which tend to sour a little when Weaver , working as a nurse in a local school , ruffles a few feathers and winds up in the slammer on a morals charge . This would be bad enough at any time but it comes right on top of Moore's daughter drowning whilst in the care of Weaver . You can take it from there yourselves so suffice it to say it's a fine example of the genre .
409738	2567136	32410	7.0	Down Argentine Why ? . . .	. . . when it could just as soon have been called Down Upper Sandusky Way in terms of plot . What it was , of course , was at once a morale booster and a nod to its South American neighbours from the movie capital of North America if not the world . This was Carmen Miranda's first appearance outside the Latin American market and as such she has absolutely nothing to do with anything even faintly resembling a plot . C . Aubrey Smith lookalike Henry Stephenson is about as convincing as a South American horse-breeder as Michael Jackson would be as a gaucho but if things like this bother you then you're missing the point . Charlotte Greenwood weighs in with her trademark high kicks and there are more of the same from the Nicholas Brothers ; leads Don Ameche and Betty Grable exhibit as much chemistry as an empty petri dish but score individually whilst Mack Gordon and Harry Warren turned in a score that was just about up to snuff . All in all a pleasant enough crowd-pleaser .
408804	2567136	39273	7.0	Actor Proof	It was , perhaps , inevitable that Sacha Guitry would eventually get round to writing about his father , Lucien , a star of Le Comedy Francaise and a couple of Silent films ( he died in 1925 ) and an actor of the school that included Jack Barrymore , Bransby Williams and others of that ilk . Never one to hide his light under a bushel Sacha plays a dual role of father and son and clearly has a lot of fun panning from himself to himself as if to challenge the audience to hold its collective breath . He limns his father economically as in the scene where Lucien is in his study declaiming aloud from a favorite text only to be interrupted by the telephone : ' Pardon , Moliere ' cries the thespian to the playwright as he answers it . Elsewhere Guitry shoots a scene almost entirely in a mirror , a schtick he had used in other films . A fine addition to the Guitry canon .
408989	2567136	56937	7.0	Three On The Nile	It is , of course , impossible to approach this film as just another release in a typical week because for better or worse it comes with baggage - the original director fired , ditto original writers , escalating production problems , the world press feeding frenzy surrounding the Burton-Taylor offscreen romance and last but not least Mank staying up all night to write the screenplay and then shooting all day . In some cases , notably Casablanca and The Blue Dahlia , writers staying one camera setup ahead of shooting can produce brilliant results but even Mank couldn't quite hit paydirt here . A child could discern the difference between the first half which explores Cleopatra's relationship with Caesar and the second in which Marc Anthony takes up the running and the only conclusion to be reached is that Mank was more sympathetic to the first relationship - he had , of course , already offered his own take on Julius Caesar in 1952 ( trivia buffs will note that John Hoyt appeared in both movies ) and more or less phoned in the Tony and Cleo segment . There are those who will savor the irony of third-rate joke actors like Martin Benson sharing a screen with Burton - though to be fair the way Burton walks through his part it's no more than he deserves . On balance this is a film that should be seen and allowances made for virtually all involved from Mank downwards who had done so much better and would , in some cases , do so again .
408927	2567136	45094	7.0	Bali Hi-De-Hi	By this time - the sixth in an eventual series of seven - the formula was well established ; wise-cracks , in-jokes , forget the ' fourth wall ' , throw in some ' cameos ' ( in this case Bogie , Jane Russell , Bob Crosby and Martin and Lewis ) , a ' plot ' that sees Bing con Bob into taking some dangerous job ( human canon ball , deep-sea diver , etc ) , a soupcon of song and dance and away we go . This time around the duo leave town one bullet in front of a shotgun wedding - actually two bullets and two shotgun weddings as both Bing and Bob have dallied with local girls in Australia . They were , by definition , of their time so that much of the humour may seem flat but what remains is the great ' timing ' and rapport between Hope and Crosby and perhaps above all the songs , many of which became not only ' hits ' of the day but went on to become ' standards ' such as Moonlight Becomes You and But Beautiful . This is hardly surprising given that Johnny Burke wrote the lyrics for the first six and Jimmy Van Heusen the music for the last six ( Burke worked with composer James V . Monaco - ' Too Romantic ' on the first in the series , Singapore and Van Heusen worked with new partner Sammy Cahn on the seventh , Hong Kong ) . The score here is as fine as ever with such gems as Chicago Style , To See You Is To Love You , Hoots , Mon , and Moonflower . Maybe not the best of the seven but not the worst either and the only one in colour .
409927	2567136	29971	7.0	Flagging Franchise ? Pas du tout	There's been quite a lot of disappointment registered over the years , from initial critical and public reaction through comments right here , about this production which fail to do it justice . It is , to a certain extent , understandable , a minimal score , Astaire playing a non-performer for the first time in the franchise and Rogers doing the chasing for a change , were all contributory factors but if you can get past that you're left with a pleasant comedy that boasts two very fine numbers in I Used To Be Color Blind and Change Partners plus another tour de force dance number - with golf balls yet - for Astaire , so what do you want , blood ? In retrospect it's possible to see this , the eighth teaming of Astaire and Rogers as the mold-breaker inasmuch as their next entry - and the last for an entire decade - would be The Story Of Vernon And Irene Castle in which , once again , they deserted the formula to portray real people . All that to one side this is still a highly enjoyable romp .
408794	2567136	91715	7.0	Bridge Over Shallow Water	Consider the cast : Richard Bohringer , Daniel Auteuil , Phillipe Leotard , Jean Yanne , Michel Piccoli , Fanny Ardant , Jeanne Moreau - seven of the heaviest hitters in French cinema - throw in a bargain priced DVD and who WOULDN'T buy it ? This dream cast ensures that it IS worth watching but there are those who may struggle to cope with the surreal aspects which have some of the hallmarks of Death In A French Garden , the work of the same director . Here we have an ongoing bridge game in which the participants have titles rather than names - The Doctor , The Journalist , The Honorable Trader - in a slightly unrealistic setting that resembles a darker version of the one in Les Demoiselles de Rochefort , a vast space not unlike the Gare d'Orsay that Orson Welles utilised for The Trial . In the background is Jeanne Moreau , who bears yet another title , The Brothel Keeper ; at her right-hand The Paltoquet ( nonentity ) Michel Piccoli and spending a great deal of time in an incongruous hammock is Fanny Ardant . The bridge game is interrupted by the Flic ( Jean Yanne ) who commandeers the Doctor to determine the cause of death of a body that has just been discovered . Soon the Doctor is accused ( by Yanne ) of the crime and in the fullness of time the other players are also accused . In terms of storyline that's about it . None of the principals is in need of acting lessons and it's never less than interesting but more than that . . .
409975	2567136	24258	7.0	Ruth In Alien Corn	For admirers of early Hollywood talkies this movie fields an impressive cast list ; Ruth Chatterton , George Brent , Guy Kibbee , Frank McHugh and an uncredited Mayo Methot for good measure . It is , of course , pure meller and crammed with plot and subplot that shows just how anaemic today's johnny-one-note plots are . Director Wellman keeps the whole thing bubbling so that the absurdities don't have time to take root . To nutshell it Chatterton falls for a wronggo , marries him and lives to regret it ; he ankles one step ahead of the sheriff leaving her pregnant ; all this is against the backdrop of a carney where they all work . With hubby out of the picture lush Frank McHugh offers marriage , she accepts and loses the child . Enter George Brent representing True Love but before they can walk off into the sunset McHugh is badly beaten ( don't ask ) so the plays the martyr card . End of story . interesting rather than memorable .
408817	2567136	39737	7.0	Night Of The Hunted	At this time in his career - he was emerging from his Hopalong Cassidy years into adult mainstream cinema - Robert Mitchum had his share of offbeat female co-stars and if you thought Mitchum and Katherine Hepburn ( Undercurrent ) was a tad off-the-wall how about Mitchum and Judith Anderson , the Hamlet-playing distinguished stage actress . In a plot that makes a pretzel look like a breadstick with a ramrod up its spine they are cast as orphan and self-appointed ' mother ' ( don't ask ) ; Mitchum grows up on a ranch with no male role-model as the ' outsider ' of three children - the others being the biological son and daughter of Anderson . The plot unfurls - and boy , does it take its time - in that familiar device that enjoyed something of a vogue at the time , the flashback , so we begin with Teresa Wright - Mitchum's wife and longtime ' sister ' , given she's the biological daughter of Anderson and has grown up with Mitchum - riding out to join Mitchum , who is holed up and being pursued by a gang of what we don't yet know . In one of the most wacky uses of the flashback on record - these two grew up in the same house from very early childhood , remember - he starts to tell her of his past and as she knows most of this by definition , he mentions a consistent nightmare involving a man's feet wearing distinctive spurs . Via this and subsequent flashbacks we get a picture of a disturbed child , Jeb , who is never accepted by the other boy , Adam , in the family whilst clearly loved by Wright . He doesn't get many breaks , a psychopath , Dean Jagger , who hates him unrealistically , attempts to kill a ten-year old but succeeds only in killing his horse ; when confronted by Anderson , he spews out his hate for the boy and the ' family ' he springs from and then , equally unrealistically , agrees to back off and wait til the boy grows up for his revenge . When the army needs men and the ranch can only spare one the decision as to which one will go is left to the toss of a coin and Mitchum loses ; this is pretty much the pattern of his life until the denouement but the problem is that Mitchum doesn't do tormented , he does Brutal , Laid-Back , but Angst isn't in his palette . You can call this noir , a psychological western , a mystery but in the end it is all these and none of them whilst remaining interesting and watchable .
409558	2567136	150464	7.0	Guilty Pleasures	Gerard Lanvin and Virginie Ledoyen first appeared together in Les Marmottes in 1993 and teamed up again five years later for this remake of Simenon's En Cas de malheur exactly forty years after Jean Gabin and Brigitte Bardot did it first time around . There's not a great deal of originality in the storyline - young , amoral girl seduces middle-aged lawyer , shacks up with him but continues to see her old yobbish boyfriend on the side and , oh , yes , it all ends in tears - but Lanvin and Ledoyen are two of the finest French actors working today and that's before we factor in Carole Bouquet as Lanvin's chic and talented wife , Denis Podalydes as a rival advocate and Francois Berleand , a partner in Lanvin's law firm . Guillaume Canet as Ledoyen's ex who won't let go has a nice line in obnoxious arrogance and makes it easy to despise him . Given the names I've mentioned no one should be surprised that the acting is top-notch if not first rate which means that this is well worth a look .
409146	2567136	375679	7.0	The Kingfish Syndrome	Nothing in the several episodes of ' Due South ' or the Oscar-Winning ' Million Dollar Baby ' , just two of his writing credits , prepared me for Crash . At a very basic level it echoes Robert Penn Warren's terrific novel All The King's Men , a thinly disguised portrait of Huey ' Kingfish ' Long , whose complex character could be boiled down to ' there's a little bit of good in the worst of us and a little bit of bad in the best ' . There are further nods in the direction of Robert Altman who also likes to people a canvas with several diverse characters and slowly allow them to meld so that the good become blurred with the bad and the bad . . . well , you get the point . Although I can't exactly toss my hat into the ring with the majority of previous posters I did keep watching to the end and I was unable to fault the performers but there's a nagging feeling deep down that keeps murmuring that somehow we need a little more than this .
408835	2567136	440963	7.0	Cut To The Chase	' Action ' barely rate even a blip on my personal radar but this one enjoyed a fairly universal fine critical response so when I found myself in another city and checked out the sole multiplex this was the only game in town , making it that or the nearest bar . I can see where the critics were coming from and I guess that as ' action ' movies go this one certainly delivers but whilst it entertained it failed to engross me to the extent that I did NOT question as it was unspooling rather than later just HOW Bourne was able to travel so easily and quickly from country to country with - presumably - no passport and little or no money . In a similar way I queried the ' cheating ' in the way that director Greengrass shot certain episodes , usually those involving high speed chases / fights etc so that , with the best will in the world , it is impossible to know just WHAT is happening ; in other words we are unable to follow a given person and / or vehicle from A to Z and trace the trajectory . What we get is something like A to about F then it turns into alphabet soup before stabilizingng round about X , Y or Z . Call me old fashioned but I call this SLOPPY film making from a director clearly convinced that the popcorn brigade won't CARE about logic and continuity just so long as the crashes keep coming . Apart from these cavils it was a pleasant enough time-passer .
410137	2567136	36160	7.0	This Contented Rosie	At the time this must have been easy to file as painless propaganda ; Launder and Gilliat start off as if attempting to emulate Noel Coward's classic This Happy Breed , we are introduced to a cut-rate Gibbons family and in particular two daughters , one a flighty Queenie clone this time called Elsie ( Joy Shelton ) and a more grounded Phyllis , now called Cecilia ( Patricia Roc ) but very soon and perhaps wisely the team realise that even the two of them are light years short of one Noel Coward so they veer off into Rosie The Riveter mode and give us a picture of Women At War which is not unpalatable by any means . There are two romances both slightly improbable , Patricia Roc snags a hopelessly inept Gordon Jackson whilst second female lead Ann Crawford winds up with Eric Portman . Seen today for the first time it failed to bore or embarrass though the England depicted is on the far side of the galaxy compared to what Blair has made of it .
409419	2567136	48641	7.0	Brief Encounters	Having seen the Musical version of this film , A Little Night Music , several times I watched the movie with one eye on how faithfully it had been adapted and the other as if I were adapting it into a musical and looking for suitable places to ' spot ' numbers . On balance I found the adaptation remarkably faithful to Bergman with perhaps the character of Desiree's mother enlarged slightly and all the names and most of the situations retained . Not being so informed about Bergman and his oeuvre as I might be I had somehow formed the impression that he made this light comedy quite some time after and as something of a break from and a contrast to his early dark work like Seventh Seal so I was surprised to read here that Smiles in fact preceded Seal . It should not , of course matter where a given title occurs in a filmmakers catalogue all that should matter is how well he made the film in question . Overall in this case I'd say pretty well . After a slight irritation of the clumsy exposition in which two of the clerks employed by the chief character , lawyer Fredrik Egerman , tell each other ( and us ) that 1 ) Fredrik has two tickets for the theatre where the star of the show , Desiree Arnfeld , used to be his mistress and 2 ) that he will be going with his new wife , Anne , who is half his age and leaving his son , Henrik , by a previous marriage , at home , it settled down into a well observed comedy of manners owing a little to a current American film , Baby Doll , in its central story of a child bride who refuses to consummate the marriage but then spinning off another series of lovers both star-crossed and otherwise . The cast reads like a roll call of the Bergman stock company , Harriet Andersson , Ulla Jacobsson , Gunnar Bjornstrand , Eva Dahlbeck etc and not unnaturally they play as an ensemble . As several other people have said here this is as good and as painless an introduction to Bergman as any .
410193	2567136	38032	7.0	Baked Alaska	This is , unquestionably , one of the best of the ' Road ' franchise . It began with a one-off , Singapore , and even the second , Zanzibar , was more accident than design but with the third entry , Morocco , the franchise was up and running and this , the fourth title , builds on the strengths of Morocco and reaches slightly beyond . By now the two male leads are established as performers , in this case vaudevillians at the turn of the century and all they need is an excuse to light out for the applicable destination and run into Dorothy Lamour . For the record we're talking map of hidden goldmine , acquired by Bing and Bob from the crooks , Sperry and McGurk , who murdered the real owner , and which rightfully belongs to Lamour , the daughter of the murdered man . Along with the usual gags , dismantling of the fourth wall , and the added ingredient of Robert Benchley's narrator , are the songs and this is one of the best bunch in the entire franchise , from Goodtime Charley , through Put It There , Pal , Welcome To My Dream , Should You and Personality . Dated , maybe but out of date , no .
409094	2567136	298126	7.0	Oh , I DO Like To Be Beside The Seaside	This is another charmer . The great thing about France is that filmmakers are allowed to make ' small ' films like this without being penalized . In the same year ( 2002 ) for example Le Chignon d'Olga was also released and between them both films racked up something like 100 , 000 admissions but nobody yelled , no heads rolled , in fact Julie Lopes-Curval who directed Bord de mer went on to write La role de sa vie which co-screenwriter of Bord de mer , Francois Favrat , directed and with Agnes Jaoui and Karin Viard co-starring ' Role ' was a much more high-profile project . Not a lot happens in Bord de mer . If you want an analogy it's something like Walden if Thoreau had been part of a community . It's just a record of a year in a small seaside town which is virtually almost always out-of-season even in the summer because the only visitors are regulars , most of whom own property rather than staying in hotels / pensions . It's a company town to the extent that a small family company ' mine ' the sea for stones which are then ' sorted ' by the locals and used to manufacture anything that CAN be manufactured from pebbles . We follow a handful of people , the best known being Bulle Ogier and Ludmilla Mikhael , ex-Comedy Francaise as they are , in the immortal words of Johnny Burke , busy doing nothing . The film is shot in lovely , not to say restful , pastels and a second viewing some two years later was just as enjoyable as the initial one .
408923	2567136	62452	7.0	O , Mistress Minefield	I had to stop the DVD and wind back when I caught the briefest glimpse of someone who looked like Anouk Aimee in the boxing match sequence and sure enough it was one of the two stars of Lelouch's biggest hit by a country mile , Un Homme et une femme , though what she was meant to signify is anybody's guess . As if that weren't reminder enough Francis Lai's evocative score often gets to within one quaver of a plagiarism suit - or would , if he could plagiarise himself legally - before veering off at a tangent . Yves Montand is having a ball - on paper ; a high-profile job that takes him all over the world , a mistress in every port and Annie Girardot waiting back home yet he is shot through with a vague melancholy and almost tangible discontent . Montand is superb , he was just finding his acting chops proper after two decades as a world-class singer and the odd foray into film and Compartiment tuer , a couple of years earlier , had seen him blossom into a fully-fledged actor but if he is superb Girardot is outstanding and faced with competition from both these giants Candice Bergen does well to hold her own but luckily she married Louis Malle around this time and didn't need to depend on acting to put food on the table . Lelouch employs a couple of interesting techniques but tends to negate these by lacing the drama with newsreel footage which doesn't really develop the story so much as merely punctuate it for punctuation's sake . In my case I have a desire to see anything and everything in which Montand appears but those who don't may find it pretty ho-hum .
409185	2567136	291538	7.0	Lite-Housekeeping	Yet another small gem from that great year of French pics 2002 . The talent is out of the right bottle too if anybody asks you , writer director Claude Berri and male lead Jean-Pierre Bacri , no slouch as a writer himself . To a certain extent is IS a male fantasy with Emillie Duquenne all but throwing herself at Bacri who has to be twice her age at least . But , as others have pointed out in these boards Bacri is basically decent and certainly wasn't looking for a May-December affair only for someone to police his apartment . For reasons of her own Duquenne developed what seemed to be genuine hots for him and naturally he's not going to turn down an attractive young girl . There's no special insight nor is any attempted , it's just a record of a brief fling in which nobody really gets hurt and we get to see some pleasant Parisian locations and listen to some pleasing music . Lemon soufflé anyone .
408935	2567136	33209	8.0	Time Was . . .	. . . when a film by Julien Duvivier featuring heavy hitters Raimu , Louis Jouvet , Michele Morgan , Suzy Prim , Fernand Ledoux and Robert Le Vigan would not have disappointed my French friend quite so much . We tend to agree more than we disagree and are both great admirers of Duvivier but this time we differ slightly . Hindsight is , of course , a wonderful thing and 20-20 hindsight is much sought-after . I'm inclined to think that as he was shooting this in 1940 Duvivier knew he was leaving France to stay in America for what must have seemed indefinitely so he chose to shoot not so much a film as a valentine to his homeland . My friend has also pointed out that Duvivier is at his best with less sprawling canvasses and it's true that the picaresque is not his natural habitat but as a non-French lover of French movies I revelled in the company of some of the very finest actors that France had to offer illustrating a painless history lesson spanning seventy years , indeed it may well have been subtitled 70 Glorious Years .
409676	2567136	474312	8.0	I KNEW It Would Be Good	Jean-Pierre Darroussin has enhanced - and in some cases stolen - some seventy odd movies in the last 30 years , quietly racking up excellent character studies and when offered the chance to ' carry ' a major movie - Feux Rouges - he was more than up to the task and succeeded brilliantly . Now he has directed his first full length feature ( following and Award Winning Short some years ago ) and like another illustrious actor , Gerard Jugnot , he has also written ( or co-written ) it and plays the leading role . To say he pulls off all three roles wonderfully is to understate . This is a small masterpiece and it was both a pleasure and a privilege to shake his hand at the screening which he attended ( and which , in their wisdom , both the BFI and Cine Lumiere had omitted to mention in their respective Brochures ) . Darroussin has saddled himself with one of the trickiest characters an actor can play , a ' decent ' man , the kind perhaps embodied by Gregory Peck in To Kill A Mockingbird and by coincidence both characters are lawyers , but whilst Peck - who was , it must be repeated , absolutely brilliant - had a high-profile court case to showcase his innate decency Darroussin has much less to work with playing out his life in an unfashionable area of Paris and performing good deeds which are deliberately misinterpreted so that he winds up almost as a neighborhood Monsieur Hire thanks largely to the poisonous tongue of his fellow screenwriter Valerie Stroh who brands him a pervert . The character , recently divorced , has chosen to virtually cut himself off from his family who are suitably and snobbishly horrified at his new apartment , and dispense more or less free legal advice and even lend money to deadbeat clients , one of whom proceeds to beat up his wife who winds up in hospital and with himself in the slammer it falls upon Darroussin to house the teenage daughter of the marriage . He does all this with no reservations , acting almost trance-like , never doubting that he is doing the ' right ' and / or ' christian ' thing for which , of course , he must be punished . Darroussin is in almost every scene and displays remarkable assurance and control , contriving to bring glowing oils to what is essentially a water colour pastel . It is to be hoped that the writing-acting-directing team of Darroussin and Stroh continue in this vein with as much success as Jaoui and Bacri with whom , on this showing , they must now be favourably compared .
408969	2567136	66498	8.0	Ear ? Here ? Fear ! Cheer	It's not all that often that I for one come across a movie totally unknown to me and written , directed and performed by people who are just names albeit names worthy of respect in their own country . Ucho is one of those films from a country we used to call Czechoslovakia - Billy Wilder had a lot of fun with the name , recommending spelling it backwards as a cure for insomnia in his script for Bluebeard's Eighth Wife - which then became the Czech Republic and has now fragmented into the Czech Republic and Slovakia . What few films I've seen from there - with the possible exception of ' Daisies ' - I've enjoyed though it is a woefully small total , The Fireman's Ball , Closely Observed Trains , Kolya , Divided We Fall , which are now supplemented by Ucho . Watching it I was reminded in turn of L'Aveu and The Trial given that it contains elements of both . It's also something of a Long Night's Journey Into Day chronicling as it does the time that elapses between a government Minister arriving home late from a party to slowly realise that in the absence of himself and his wife their house has been bugged by his own Party , and the next morning when his fears prove theoretically groundless as he learns he is to replace a Minister who has been deposed . Although on paper this makes for a sigh of relief in reality it just means he will have an even higher profile and be that much bigger a target for Party hit men . Shot in black and white the film mirrors a society that for us in the West is virtually impossible to imagine but even then the tension is liberally laced with humour . A fine film in a fine tradition .
409522	2567136	68421	8.0	Here's Looking At You , Kids	On paper this shouldn't have survived the Pitch but on celluloid it metamorphoses into a fine almost folksy film which , like the central cattle drive , succeeds against all the odds . The central premise is simplicity personified ; ageing rancher Duke Wayne needs to get his cattle to market , normally this is no problem but he needs to do it NOW and it's only days since gold fever struck with a vengeance leaving no one available for the drive . Necessity being the mother of invention Duke is more or less forced to recruit some genuine cowBOYS inasmuch as he turns literally to a group of schoolboys who know absolutely nothing about driving cattle long distances and have even less experience . Throw in a Black cook cum philosopher cum fount-of-all-wisdom , a peripatetic troupe of hookers and a Very , Very BAD man in the shape of Bruce Dern , leading a gang of rustlers and we're talking one of the most entertaining Westerns that ever came down the pike .
409594	2567136	39615	8.0	Sub-Standard ? On The Contrary	If there were such a position as Poet Laureate of the Second World War then Rene Clement would surely be a strong candidate for office . Beginning with La Bataille du rail at the very end of hostilities he returned to it in Le pere tranquil , Jeux Interdits and Paris , Brule-e-til . Les Maudits is arguably the star in his crown albeit he ' borrowed ' the idea of hell as other people from Sartre and it's hardly new to use a small space as a microcosm of a larger society nevertheless - and without the use of major stars - he is able to rack up the tension like the master he is in this Henri Jeanson scripted tale of what might be called a Ship Of Foils , a mixed bag of Nazis , businessmen , mistresses etc all for one reason or another anxious to get to South America via submarine at the tail-end of the war . They make two stops en route , once to hijack a doctor after one of the passengers is injured and once in Africa where Marcel Dalio - the sole ' name ' in the cast - has a warehouse . Clement skillfully builds the atmosphere and explores the conflicts that inevitably develop and offers no respite . It might be a typical Hollywood ' bomber-crew ' movie but it is far from a Hollywood ending . Excellent .
409544	2567136	35608	8.0	Re-Action In The South Of England	Frankly I wasn't expecting much from this flag-waver which I've never seen until today's screening as part of a Bogie retrospective at the NFT . I was aware that it formed part of Bogie's war-time CV and I had also read the oft-repeated story of how Bogie and Massy made an on-set wager as to whose stunt double was the bravest . That's what I KNEW . What I EXPECTED was a morale-booster laced liberally with not-too-subtle propaganda ( given that the screenplay was by John Howard Lawson who never let a chance to praise Communism pass ) and a cast of trained seals walking through it . What I GOT was actually very entertaining and informative , a movie that both invites and can withstand comparison with In Which We Serve . In both films a ship is blown out of the water in the first three reels , there are several survivors who eventually join another ship and sea-time is leavened by shore time . One ( In Which We Serve ) celebrates the Royal navy whilst the other ( Action In The North Atlantic ) deals with the Merchant navy and draws attention to the vital part the service played in the War effort . In Which We Serve on balance comes off marginally better but it did have the virtue of being written and co-directed by an exceptionally talented man , Noel Coward , who also played a leading role and apart from this Coward was able to lard his screenplay with a richer ' civilian ' storyline inasmuch as England , unlike America , suffered heavy bombing resulting in thousands of civilian casualties . What we are left with is a fine film with realistic dialogue slightly more colorful than that in the British film , sterling performances from a typical Hollywood ' bomber-crew ' including the ubiquitous Alan Hale , plus Sam Levene and Dane Clark . Ruth Gordon and Julie Bishop are stuck with the thankless roles of sailor's wives and for good measure Bishop gets to sing Cole Porter's Night And Day . It was a meister stroke to get a Hitler looka-like ( complete with moustache to make sure we get it ) to play the U-Boat officer behind the initial attack . There's probably little scope for further screenings outside of this kind of retrospective but it's definitely worth looking out for on DVD .
409413	2567136	118201	8.0	Not Only That . . .	. . . but it'll still be snowing in July , metaphorically at least , for this mother and her seven children . By pure coincidence I saw this film within days of Au Hasard Balthazar so that I couldn't help but be struck by the similarities , both feature , for example , the abuse of dumb animals but in the former Balthazar really IS an animal whilst in the latter it is Dominique Reymond who is both dumb first for ever getting involved with Daniel Duval and second for staying with him to BE abused by him and there is , of course , an extra twist in that Duval is himself an animal so that the end product is one animal abusing not only a dumb woman but also their own children . In its cyclical nature the film also resembles Etre et Avoir without the joy . There is no doubt that Sandrine Veysset has written and directed a fine film which treads a fine line between documentary and fiction . We are plunged into the action with no preparing the ground - ironic in a film in which farming plays such a large part - and left to work out that Reymonde has , for reasons not explained and thus open to such interpretations as that old catch-all low self esteem , at some time in the past become the mistress cum slave of Duval who in turn has a legal wife and another family in a neighbouring village . He seems to be totally without finer feelings and views his mistress and their seven children as cheap labour first , second and last and at one point he even accuses Reymonde of refusing to ' service ' him which speaks volumes of how he sees her although he has already provided an insight into his sensitivity when he makes sexual overtures to his own daughter , which is why Reymonde is reluctant to continue sexual relations with him . The thing that Reymonde has in spades is both a highly developed maternal instinct and an incredible amount of love for her children which is evident in everything she does . If ever a film illustrated Oscar Wilde's oft-quoted ' we are all in the gutter but some of us are looking at the stars ' it is surely this wonderful movie . Overwhelming .
409890	2567136	161836	8.0	The Wages Of Virtue	On a superficial level this could be described as Guys and Dolls without the Frank Loesser score and an unhappy ending , Beautiful Salvation Army Girl Saves Sinner's Soul And He Enlists but that approach would do justice to neither . Very few , if indeed any , actresses did ' goodness / sadness ' better than Michele Morgan , blessed as she was , with two of the most expressive eyes in the business and here it is , in a manner of speaking , business as usual as her Salvationist ( lieutenant ) encounters low-life Rene Lefevre and by her example turns his life around . Given the size of his billing Michel Simon has a relatively small role as captain , appearing only in the second half of the film . He and Morgan had played together memorably in Quai des Brumes the previous year ( imdb is incorrect in dating this as 1940 , it was actually released in 1939 ) but then they had been adversaries rather than comrades . Morgan herself doesn't make an appearance until the third reel but that gives us time to see just how wicked Lefevre is for only when we know the depth of his degradation can we measure his ascent . Morgan encounters him when he is affecting blindness and making a decent living out of gullible people and her subsequent treatment of him causes him to initially fall in love with her and then take inspiration from her selflessness . In a nice touch this is a love story with no kisses or caresses and as is often the case Morgan pays the price for being virtuous , expiring from a long-time wasting sickness . Georges Lacombe was a fair journeyman director with the Henri-Georges Clouzot screenplay Les Derniers des six arguably his finest directorial effort with this one not far behind .
408942	2567136	239237	8.0	Lawsome Foursome	I'm not familiar with the Georges Simenon novel which forms the basis of this highly entertaining film but if Henri Decoin was faithful to the original in his adaptation then it is far from the usual Simenon fare and more the territory of Sacha Guitry who actually tackled a similar subject in Quadrille . Set in Cannes the story revolves around the unbearable Annette ( Louise Carletti ) who falls for handsome lawyer Marcel ( Henri Garat ) who in turn is pitching the woo to haughty American ( and blonde with it ) Myriame ( Mona Goya ) who in turn is attempting to charm the shy Bernard ( Georges Rollin ) . With a brittle script by Decoin even journeyman director Jean Dreville can't knock the gloss of this one and it all moves at a fair clip until the finale which sees Annette getting Marcel to the altar only to ditch him in favour of Bernard . Well worth a look .
409598	2567136	1135968	8.0	Dog Days	One can only applaud production companies willing to bankroll films as non-commercial as this . I'd be hard put to say exactly who its target audience is but I hope it finds it . It's something that could only be English despite strong elements of Hungary and Australia . It's probably just as well that the title is sufficiently insipid to bypass those in search of exploding heads and twisted metal and although I have just seen it at a Multiplex it has all the earmarks - one might even say dog-earmarks - of Art House fodder . To nutshell it we're in Edwardian England where Jeremy Northam pays a duty call each week on his eccentric father , Peter O'Toole . There had been another son who perished in the Boer War . Enter Dean Spanley , Sam O'Neill , who has a penchant for Tokay and a tendency to reminisce under its influence of the years he spent as a dog . Rounding out the principals is Bryan Brown , procurer of the hard-to-find Tokay and witness to the reminiscing . It comes together rather too well , perhaps , but remains laden with charm . Try and catch it if you're feeling pixilated .
409936	2567136	58450	8.0	Hello Brolly	Okay , here's a superficial smart-ass take on this entry : We're in a French port , there's a guy who loves a gal and a gal who loves him right back , arguably she loves him just a tad more than he loves her . He goes away for a couple of years but not without leaving her pregnant . There's an older guy , richer guy in love with her for whom until now she had no time . She levels about her situation and he marries her anyway and raises the child as his own . Now , hands up all those who said ' That's " Marius " by Marcel Pagnol , the first part of his great trilogy ' . While you're wiping the egg off your faces I'll try a less frivolous take . IF Pagnol had been born in the North instead of the South of France it's just feasible that he may have written a story set in the Northern French port of Cherbourg , called his male protagonist Guy and not Marius , had him conscripted into the army for his obligatory two years National Service spent in Algeria and called his female protagonist Genvieve instead of Fanny . Jacques Demy may well have had Marius in mind albeit subconsciously when he wrote and directed The Umbrellas Of Cherbourg - and it was , incidentally , just about the same time that Harold Rome wrote the words and music for a condensed and musical version of Pagnol's trilogy which , as ' Fanny ' was produced on Broadway by David Merrick - but nobody creates in a vacuum and Demy has come up with a charming , not to say enchanting movie . How referential it actually is can be left to the quasi-academic pseuds but it might be worth noting in passing Demy's self-referential nod to his earlier equally romantic movie ' Lola ' in which the character of Roland Cossard ( played here by the same actor , Marc Michel ) was the protagonist in love with Anouk Aimee's eponymous Lola , the background music was also by Michel Legrand whose main love theme turns up again here . Younger viewers will most likely be unaware of the two half-decent lyrics that were written for the two main themes of Umbrellas and enjoyed no little success as respectively ' I Will Wait For You ' and ' Watch What Happens ' and those who DO remember will marvel at the banality of Demy's original words - ' lyrics ' may be stretching it . It might be interesting to discover which came first , Demy's pedestrian words or Legrand's lush melodies . It's fun at that to imagine Legrand , faced with something like ' pass the salt ' , ' it looks like a nice day ' , ' the girls are wearing their hair shorter this year ' , etc and coming up with those gorgeous melodies ( I'd rather not dwell on the opposite ) . Ultimately this is a movie it's hard not to like , from the muted pastels , reminiscent of Les Grands Manouvres , to the Audrey Hepburn-lite sub-Givenchy outfits worn by Deneuve and Ann Vernon as her mother . Cynics may say that it's just one large chocolate-box full of soft centres and they'd have a point but it's not too long and it does offer both entertainment and escape .
409787	2567136	397692	8.0	Building Up To An Awful Let-Down . . .	. . . to paraphrase the lyric Johnny Mercer wrote to Fred Astaire's music way back when . This features the delectable Carole Bouquet as a lawyer with two adolescents and no husband on her hands . What she is happy to treat as a one-night stand backfires when the guy in question falls in love with her and decides to move in . In real life a lawyer wouldn't have much of a problem getting him to leave but this is movies as opposed to real life so the solution she comes up with is to have the whole house renovated . Predictably it winds up as a sort of Mr . Blandings Builds His Dream House-lite with chaos accelerating until just when everything collapsible has collapsed and been rebuilt half the crew turn out to be illegals with no papers so the flics raid the joint , the illegals take it on the Jesse Owens but not without destroying the house again . There's lots to enjoy here not least Bouquet letting her hair down .
408806	2567136	194201	8.0	Don't Take It As Gospel	The Champo - a small cinema du quartier in Paris - is to be applauded for staging this major retrospective of Sacha Guitry ; since January of this year they've been screening one Guitry title twice a day from a pool of twenty five which means they've now screened all of them at least twice . Most of the time it's difficult to believe they come even close to the nut but today , perhaps because it was a Bank Holiday , there were about 60 patrons for the second screening at 4 pm . This is Guitry in urban mode which means sophisticated well-dressed people sitting in salons dishing dirt and playing sexual games . The only thing that comes anywhere near Guitry in this mode is Noel Coward and even that is slightly misleading ; they were both primarily playrights , yes , and they tended to write with a swizzle stick rather than a pen , yes again , but really they were chalk and cheese . This is prime Guitry , nuff said .
409949	2567136	38116	8.0	Still In A Fair State	Rodgers and Hammerstein were nothing if not shrewd and though they have often been spoken of as innovators they were not averse from ' borrowing ' from other sources . In 1944 , one year BEFORE State Fair , MGM released ' Meet Me In St Louis ' a wonderful ' family ' oriented movie which starts by introducing the cast as they sing the title song ; a little later there is a scene in which most of the family ' taste ' a soup being prepared by mother ( Mary Astor ) and pass comments on it . So : in this movie we begin by introducing neighbour Percy Kilbride as he drives along singing the title song , soon taken up by ' Pa ' Charles Winninger ; within minutes we have a scene in which mom ( Fay Bainter ) is seen making the mincemeat she will enter at the State Fair . Pa comes in , tastes it and declares it needs ' flavoring ' with brandy . In both cases the State Fair action is truncated possibly to avoid embarrassing comparisons with St Louis but otherwise this remains a charming film , redolent of a lost era with four competent leads - though none , of course , comes even near the magic of Judy Garland - and no less than six excellent and familiar supporting players - in addition to the aforementioned Bainter , Kilbride and Winninger there are Henry Morgan , Donald Meek and Frank McHugh . The story is soap-bubble fragile and the songs for once from this duo are ALMOST schmaltz-free though frustrated poet Hammerstein was unable to resist having a bird ' throwing his heart at the sky ' . Dick Haymes has the best voice in the movie by a country mile - with both Jeanne Crain and Dana Andrews being dubbed and Vivian Blaine sounding no better and no worse than dozens of other ' band ' singers of the time - whilst It Might As Well Be Spring is arguably the best song Rodgers and Hammerstein ever wrote . All in all it's a very pleasant nostalgic revel .
410276	2567136	51679	8.0	Sugar Beat	Gabin became a star in the thirties , ' eloped ' to the US during the war then made something of a glorious comeback in the fifties and went on to do some outstanding ' lion in winter ' stuff such as Le Chat in which he gave as good as he got to another icon of French cinema Simone Signoret . Here he is cast as the matriarch of a powerful and influential family whose fortune is built on sugar . Despite their distinguished achievements - they have legions of honor like other families have second cars - they are a pretty despicable bunch . The son is not fit for purpose so far as running the business is concerned whilst the prospective son-in-law ( Bernard Blier ) is more than up to it . Add Pierre Brasseur to the mix and you have an outstanding cast recording the downfall of a proud and arrogant dynasty . Highly recommended .
409680	2567136	463486	8.0	Elf Hazard	There's a lovely tongue-in-cheek disclaimer at the beginning of this film to the effect that neither the events nor the characters depicted are based on real people or events , especially , nudge , nudge , wink , wink , the Elf scandal which rocked France lo , these few moons ago . No film of course should presuppose a previous knowledge on the part of the audience ; the average film-goer outside France will have little or no knowledge of Elf and the French Government Ministers involved in corruption just as the average film-goer will know of Marie Antoinette only that she once said ' let them eat cake ' and by coincidence Sophia Coppola's take on Marie Antoinette opens here , in London , tomorrow , whilst L'Ivresse du pouvoir is showing as part of the London Film Festival so it's a case of how do you like your corruption , in the 20th century heart of France or 17th century suburban Paris , that's about Versailles of it . What matters in either case is the quality of the film-making ; is it good , bad or indifferent . I've yet to see the Coppola but the Chabrol is out of the right bottle . Not a lot happens dramatically despite a nobbled car and a leap from a window , it's basically cat and mouse between Huppert's incorruptible judge and the highly corruptible ministers / big business she's attempting to nail - if she IS incorruptible Huppert is not above getting high on her power to imprison some of the fattest cats with their whiskers in the cream ( yet again a title has been badly translated ; the literal meaning of the French title is the drunkenness of power or , more colloquially , drunk on power ) which makes the French title more clear . Anybody who expects Huppert to turn in even a mediocre performance is seriously stupid and here she is right on top of her game well supported by Francois Berleand , who only a couple of years ago played her husband in Les Soeurs fachees , and here proves , as they used to say in Zenda , an opponent worthy of her steel . Go see , trust me .
409851	2567136	31345	8.0	Gleesome Threesome	To all intents and purposes this is a Claude Autant-Lara film , the Producer , Lehman , in a touch of the Irving Mills ' gave himself a director credit ( Irving Mills was a music publisher who used to ' cut himself in ' on songs written by Duke Ellington ) . Alas , they chose to utilise Parisian slang which today is not only dated but almost incomprehensible even to provincial French but that is the only cavil . We can overlook the plot - Fernandel is , to put it kindly , naive or , as we would say today , not streetwise ; he's an assistant to a jeweller , a quality which hooker Arletty immediately finds more appealing than good manners , charm , handsomeness and given that Marcel ( Fernandel ) has had it up to here with the boss's daughter making sheeps ' eyes at him he is ripe for ' grooming ' as a jewel thief . The third member of the standout trio is Michel Simon as the laziest thief in town . For the rest of the film-going world Jean Gabin was virtually the Only French male actor between the wars which was tough on the likes of Simon , Jules Berry , Julian Carette , Bernard Blier , Charles Vanel etc . Simon in fact earned recognition earlier than Gabin when he played the eponymous Boudu who was saved from drowning by a bookseller who lived to regret it and he more than held his own with Gabin in Quai des Brumes . In short , we watch this today to see three thoroughbreds in their prime and we do not watch in vain . Once again a nod in the direction of Scandinavia without whom . . .
409998	2567136	829098	8.0	Pop Song	It's a great pity that this marvellous film was released after Atonement because it blows it out of the water . Unlike Atonement which was above all a cynical exercise in Festival film making closely allied to multi-media hype And When Did You Last See Your Father is just about making a high quality film aimed at the Art House rather than the Multiplex audience and any Awards / Nominations it happens to garner will be a bonus rather than a deliberate target . It's never been a secret that Jim Broadbent is one of Englands ' finest actors and here he gives arguably his finest performance on film ; Colin Firth on the other hand is best known for a well-polished limited range , perhaps limited by lack of opportunity rather than lack of talent and here he offers support of the highest quality . Juliet Stevenson has done far better work than this and indeed one wonders why she accepted a part that she can walk through and any film that features Sarah Lancashire is going to have at least a few worthwhile moments when she is on screen . In what amounts to a glorified cameo she comes into her own at the very end of the film in a standout scene with Colin Firth . Whilst hardly a film to send you of of the cinema with a song in your heat and a smile on your lips it is one to warm you a little and earn your respect .
410227	2567136	140074	8.0	I Told You So	Any filmmaker who offered the public something entitled They'll Come To A Bad End would hardly expect to have them queuing down the Mile End Road but say it in French , Gibier de Potence and it's a different matter entirely . It's not easy to pigeon-hole this entry from Roger Richebe dating from 1951 . At one level it's a Reverse Angle on the White Slave trade with the ' victim ' being a young man fresh out of an orphanage who is ' targeted ' by Alice ( Arletty ) an ultra discreet pimp who runs a dress shop and arranges liaisons on the side for the odd lonely ( and loaded ) lady . She breaks Marceau in gently , coaxing him initially to pose for some risqué photographs and then turning him loose on her clientele . There's a certain amount of fascination in this strictly platonic relationship - Alice is possibly asexual having flatly ruled out lesbianism yet equally indifferent to heterosexuality - and Richebe keeps us interested . Marceau who , in between gigs serves as a soldier in the Second World War , is a mixture of self-disgust and innocence and eventually and inevitably he meets a ' normal ' young girl who represents his lost innocence . They fall in love and have their mayfly moment of happiness but it is , of course , destined to end in tears . Arletty is in top form which is saying a lot and this may well be an undiscovered gem .
409929	2567136	479143	8.0	One More Time	Surprisingly for someone with a predilection for chamber / Art House movies especially French and especially NOT the Hollywood of recent years I found a lot to like here . Okay , the schmaltz is as high as a week-old steak pie but Stallone has gone to bat for the Over-The-Hill brigade and portrayed them as above all gutsy and Honorable . He turns out to be surprisingly good on relationships and instead of offering something as tawdry as Venus in which an old man lusts after a young girl he gives us a warm , intimate NON-Intimate friendship between a widower still deeply in love with his wife and a woman some twenty years younger . He mixes in just the right amount of aggression , hype and , of course , this being part of the Rocky franchise , action . For someone primarily thought of as a dumb ' animal ' a la John Rambo etc Stallone displays a sure touch as a Double-Threat Writer / Director , something I would guess that is beyond the Schwartzeneggers and Van Damns . Really worth seeing .
409624	2567136	44446	8.0	The Sound And The Glory	It's a fact universally acknowledge that some writers work better with some directors than others and vice versa . Working separately director Marcel Carne made one great film ( Hotel du Nord ) , several decent films ( Therese Raquin , Julia ou le cle des songes ) and several ho-hum entries ; also working separately Jacques Prevert fared slightly better writing Le Crime de Monsieur Lange , Les Amants de Verone , Voyage Surprise , Un oiseau rare among other but TOGETHER they made seven of the most distinguished movies in French cinema and if you want me to list them you clearly stepped in here to get out of the rain , the Multiplex is three blocks down . Terry Rattigan worked best with Puffin Asquith and David Lean with Noel Coward yet here we have Lean directing a Rattigan screenplay . You can see Lean's thinking ; he didn't want to go through life riding on the coat-tails of Coward , what Rattigan didn't know about constructing a play could fit in an eye-dropper and still leave room for an eight-to-one martini , he'd served in the RAF during the war and had written one of the two finest British war films actually produced during the war , The Way To The Stars - the other was In Which We Serve , written , produced , starring and co-directed by Coward with Lean . On paper this was great , get some stats about supersonic flight , turn them over to Terry and let him flesh them out and humanise them . Mostly it's good but it COULD have been great - think Sinatra and Lawrence Welk ; put these two together and you'll get an album that neither has to be ashamed of but team Sinatra with Billy May , Gordon Jenkins , Nelson Riddle and we're talking Hall of Fame . So : We have a lyrical opening sequence in which a plane is ' stooging ' about over the channel with the cliffs of Dover prominent ; there's a carefree , buoyant , waltz-time feel that sets us up for the revelation that this is wartime . Pilot John Justin goes into a dive and when the plane begins to shudder he finds it difficult to throttle back , an experience he discusses with chum Nigel Patrick back on the aerodrome ; Patrick , however , is in love and not interested but the object of his affection , Ann Todd , just happens to be the daughter of a leading aircraft manufacturer , Ralph Richardson , who offers Patrick a job as test pilot after the war . Rattigan gets this over economically so that we can cut to the chase , which , in this case , is the quest for fire i . e . designing and building a plane capable of supersonic flight . In only his second film Denholm Elliott unveils the prototype for his series of weak , callow youths , in the role of Todd's kid brother who funks his first solo and winds up on the menu . Leslie Phillips , sans moustache gets twice as much screen-time as Elliott but is totally forgettable leaving the real acting to the big boys . Nigel Patrick had just come off Rattigan's The Browning Version - with Puffin Asquith at the helm - and played essentially the same role if schoolteachers were piloting jet planes or pilots were flying desks . Nigel Patrick was one of the old school stage actors , shoot cuffs first , ask anyone for tennis later and enhanced virtually every film in which he played . This is a film you want to like and mostly do if only . . .
409488	2567136	41786	9.0	The Bad Shepperd	Ophuls plants a bold visual clue at the very beginning of this masterpiece that alerts us to the fact that things are not always what they seem ; as a narrator's voice-over sets the scene , Balboa , a small town 50 miles from Los Angeles , Joan Bennett emerges in a HEAVY WOOLLEN TOPCOAT and gets in her car to drive to Los Angeles for a rendez-vous with the ' older ' man who has been dating her teen-age daughter . You don't wear this kind of clothing even in Winter in Southern California and Bennett's son is invariably naked to the waist out of doors and when top-billed James Mason appears - after half an hour of a 79 minute film - he too is attired in a topcoat . The older man is played by Shepperd Strudwick , a competent journeyman actor on both stage and screen and one who could do solid , dependable family men as well as smooth con men as he does here . Inside two reels Strudwick is dead and Bennett's daughter is looking good for a murder rap but this is a Max Ophuls film - it was , in fact , the last of his Hollywood films and followed closely on the heels of Letter From An Unknown Woman and Caught . European directors had a penchant for making ' noir ' films set in daylight and out of doors and around the same time Jacques Tourneur made Out Of The Past set largely in Northern rather than Southern California ; I wouldn't like to choose between them but The Reckless Moment is a tad more cerebral and Ophuls ' celebrated fluid camera is on hand to help the story along . The main thrust has Mason's blackmailer being smitten by Bennett and ultimately crossing his ' partner ' and paying the price but with Ophuls it's not so much the story but the technique and this is a gem .
409612	2567136	99200	9.0	Golden Baule	This was the fifth of the nine films Diane Kurys has so far directed and the third of three ( Diabolo Menthe , Coup de Foudre being the others ) that deal with her own experiences in childhood and adolescence . In the second film , Coup de Foudre , the character based on Kury's own mother and fictionalised as Lena was played by Isabelle Huppert whilst here Nathalie Baye assumes the role opposite Richard Berry as husband / father Michel . The action has moved on from the war and post-war years in Lyon ( Kury's own home town ) to the late 1950s when thirteen year old Frederique ( Julie Bataille ) , the closest character to the young Kurys herself and her eight year old sister Sophie are taken by their Nanny Odette ( Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi ) to the seaside for the summer vacation . A pre-credit sequence reveals to us the gulf ( explored first in Coup de Foudre ) that now exists between the parents and which the sisters are perhaps subconsciously aware . At the last minute - literally at the railway station itself - they realize that Lena will not accompany them . Once established at the resort they take out their frustration on Odette as a ploy to force their mother to join them but when she does so she spends more time with a lover Claude ( Vincent Lindon ) than with them . Also on hand are Leon ( Jean-Pierre Bacri and the highly fertile Bella ( Zabou ) and when Michel shows up he deliberately destroys the car that symbolised Lena's independence and engages in a verbal and physical quarrel with Lena that is so intense that Frederique threatens to kill herself with a shard of glass broken during their fighting . This is an outstanding film in which the pain of adolescence is once-removed through the filter of nostalgia and replete with the tiny ' touches ' - popular songs of the day , etc - that we use as signposts to lead us back into the past . Fifteen years on it's fascinating to see the younger versions of six exceptional French actors two of whom ( Zabou with Se Souvenirs des belles chooses , and Bruni-Tedeschi with Il est plus facile pour un chameau . . . ) would go on to direct outstanding films themselves . I can't recommend this one highly enough .
408966	2567136	52311	9.0	A Touch Of Class	It seems that once again all the superlatives have been exhausted while I was out watching lesser fare - I have seen this one a few years ago but I make it a rule not to rely on my memory and post a comment only when I acquire a DVD and / or catch a given title on TV or at a Revival house . At first this feels like Kane Revisited with Joseph Cotton , Harry Shannon , Gus Schilling and Ray Collins all turning up albeit uncredited - Cotton , Schilling - in the wake of that classic opening . The maestro himself is unrecognizeable and seems to delight in coming on like a giant toad squatting on a soiled lily pad in the centre of a swamp . Most of the Welles schtick is on display from the brooding camera work to the low-angles and overlapping dialogue he pioneered in Kane and he even manages to extract a half-decent performance out of Cardboard Cutout Chuck Heston , which is quite a trick if anyone asks you . At heart , of course , it's a Doris Day movie with corruption , extortion and betrayal all on the menu . Nobody does it like Welles and we shan't see his like again .
410188	2567136	34893	9.0	Town On Trial	The element of the burnt-out case who discards the bottle to pursue justice was used much later by Paul Newman in The Verdict but Raimu got there first in this excellent movie which may be Henri Decoin's finest hour . There's a fantastic opening which establishes the provincial town and manages to convey the feeling of a rotten centre ; the rain-lashed streets and glistening cobblestones are the very essence of noir and it could be argued ( but not by me ) that Decoin lingers a tad too long on something that will not be seen again given that the bulk of the film is set in Raimu's large , decaying mansion and / or the courtroom where Decoin shows he's been influenced by Welles by including the ceilings in the frame . Raimu was rarely seen as a full-scale urbanite ( at least I've never seen him in a role that calls for collar , tie and suit ) but shows he's just as effective as a white-collar worker than a peasant / tradesman . His response to his wife's departure is to remarry immediately taking as his bride the bottle and is measuring his life with Claret when death comes to call in the shape of a stiff he finds in one of the rooms . His daughter runs with a pretty fast crowd and in nothing flat her boyfriend is tapped for the killer and despite any discernible paternal feeling Raimu takes the case and in proving the boyfriend's innocence accuses the whole town , fabric of society etc of being culpable . Like so many movies before and after the source material is a novel by Georges Simenon but the standout adaptation is the work of Henri-Georges Clouzot , on the verge of making his own mark as a first-rate director with a trio of Classics in Le Corbeau , La Salaire de la puer and Les Diaboliques to his name . All in all this is one of the finest French movies released during the Occupation and that's saying something .
408730	2567136	361127	9.0	Woodman , Woodman , Spare That Three Year Old	A good friend of mine has a built-in aversion verging on phobia against manipulative movies to the extent that it blinded her to the brilliance of Million Dollar Baby and I'm dreading what she will make of this . On the other hand she could reply that I am overly susceptible to manipulation at the hands of skilled , professional movie makers and both of us may be right . However like the man said difference of opinion is what makes horse races so we can take this one right to Aqueduct . From her point of view there's manipulation in spades . Walter ( Kevin Bacon ) is just out of the Joint after drawing 12 years for , in his own words , molesting little girls . He takes a job in a lumber yard ( heavy use of title symbolism although THAT woodsman is the one in the fairy tale who cuts the girl out of the wolf's stomach . Right off he rejects the advances of Mary-Kay - played by an actress known simply as Eve and if THAT isn't an omen what is - who is one of those egoists who figure that any guy who rejects them must have a secret that needs exposing . Adding to Walter's burden is Sgt Lucas ( Mos Def - where do the GET these names from ? ) who's a graduate of the give-a-dog-a-bad-name school of detection and enjoys nothing more than hassling Walter and delivering sloppy script points like asking Walter where he was at such a time and such a day when a girl was molested and THEN telling Walter that every move he ( Walter ) makes has been observed since he left the slammer , illustrating that by definition Walter could NOT have been involved in the alleged molestation . Just by way of an extra handicap Walter can only find a room right across the street from a school playground , which is not unlike a compulsive gambler taking a room at Caesar's Palace . The Book of Job isn't in it as Walter is denounced anonymously by Eve to add to the rest of his troubles . All the reviews I read in the National Press - unqualified raves to a man - made the same point , that we are being asked to empathize with a paedophile and wind up actually doing so . The film resembles nothing so much a a Wounded Bird Convention beginning with Walter himself then taking in Vickie ( Kyra Sedgwick , Bacon's real-life wife ) who has a tale of her own to trade for his , as a girl she was sexually abused by not one but THREE brothers , and winding up with Robin ( Hannah Pilkes ) the eleven year old girl befriended ( if that's the right word ) by Walter , who reveals obliquely that she is being abused by her father . There's not a bad performance in the whole film but I'm reminded of the now notorious comment by critic Brooks Atkinson when reviewing the first performance of Pal Joey on Broadway . After noting the excellence of the Rodgers and Hart score and the fine singing and acting on display he concluded by asking ' can you draw sweet water from a foul well ? ' From the comments I've seen posted here I'd have to say Yes .
409469	2567136	969701	9.0	In A Lonely Place	As first feature films by French Female Directors go this is right up there with La Buche , Il Est plus facile pour une chameau , Parlez-moi d'amour , Se Souvenirs des belles choses and Le Gout des autres and it may be no coincidence that Anne Le Ny acted in the last three and clearly kept her eyes and ears open . This is a very assured debut with traces of Brief Encounter and Rien a Faire and just as Noel Coward provided interesting and solid support for the protagonists of Brief Encounter so Le Ny surrounds her German teacher and graphic artist with the proprietress of a magazine-stand and her assistant and a sister and step-daughter for the male protagonist . Le Ny herself plays Nathalie , the caring sister of Betrand and throws in a lovely moment involving Nathalie's baby son and a second involving her older daughter that illustrate just how firm is her grasp of this ultimately bittersweet love story . Manu Devos and Vincent Lindon do everything asked of them and more and the whole thing has the feel of a labour of love from all concerned . Try not to miss it .
410045	2567136	45251	9.0	Moor , Moor , PLEASE !	If you would seek some kind of perspective on the Motion Picture industry you could do worse than study the career of old Awesome ; a string of masterpieces - Kane , Chimes At Midnight , Touch Of Evil - and nearasdammit masterpieces - Ambersons , Mr . Arkadin , Journey Into Fear - which he either wrote , directed and appeared in , sometimes all three , liberally laced with the trash in which he deigned to act - The Black Fox , Ferry To Hong Kong etc - in order to finance projects like this one , which belongs right up there with the masterpieces . I note that much verbiage has been spilled under this title on IMDb debating and disputing the pros and cons of the ' restored ' version and whether or not it was indeed ever ' lost ' . This is surely academic at best ; what matters is that we now HAVE a close approximation of what Awesome intended and frankly if it were any closer I couldn't stand it . The pre-credit sequence alone is worthy of one of the great Silent masters , Gance , Dreyer and like that and the first shot proper is magisterial . Time and time again Welles uses the landscape to compose startling images only to contrast this with key speeches like ' farewell the tranquil mind . . . ' which he shoots more or less straight and who else but Awesome could make such a virtue out of necessity as in the scene slated for conventional filming until the costumes failed to turn up ; his solution , stage it in a bath-house with the actors wearing towels which were themselves borrowed from their hotel . It was Welles himself who made the finest Shakespearean film of all time in Chimes At Midnight and with Othello he runs it a close second . Unmissable .
409088	2567136	948535	9.0	La Belle Equipe	Imagine you've got a hard-on for thirties Hollywood - Fred , Ginger , the Golddiggers , Bill Powell , Myrna Loy , Frank Capra , Carole Lombard , Jean Arthur , Screwball Comedy , Katie Hepburn etc - and you check out your local Multiplex and damned if someone hasn't turned out a perfect pastiche . Alas , you'll have to make do with imagination because , let's face it , you just can't get the staff ; no one currently writing and / or directing out of Hollywood has the affection , empathy , love and let's call a spade a spade , Respect for yesterday . This is not to say that Clint Eastwood , for example is a bad director , far from it , but he's not interested in that kind of stuff and there's no reason he should be . If , on the other hand your hard-on is for French films of the thirties , if in other words you lapse into drool mode at the mention of Arletty , Gabin , Prevert , Carne , Duvivier , Darrieux , Carette , Dalio , Raimu , Qai des Brumes , Hotel du Nord , Spaak , Jeanson , Aurenche et al then , mon amis , you have just died and gone to heaven , Hog Heaven yet because four years after his international hit Les Choristes , Christophe Barratier has come up with a Faberge egg of a movie that evokes all that's best about the era . The plot - a Music Hall is forced to close and the employees decide to run it themselves - is a nod to Prevert's Le Crime de Monsier Lange when it was a publishing house that got made over and indeed the Popular Front ( in which Prevert was active ) is very much in evidence . Gerard Jugnot is excellent as is Pierre Richard and Clovis Cornillac is be-capped a la Gabin albeit light years away from him in talent and charisma . Did I say there were songs as well ? You better believe it . All in all a gem .
408777	2567136	27996	9.0	Good Deeds Shines in a naughty world	Sometimes it all comes together , writer , director , cast , and this is as good an example as most . It's a while since I saw it on television - I wasn't even around when it was released - and remembered it as being not bad , I'd also read quite a bit about ' Capracorn ' , which appeared to be an excess of sentimentality cocooned in pure schmaltz , so when I found it on the shelves of my library I wasn't expecting too much . I was mistaken . I was totally engaged by its blend of cynicism and charm , by the performance of Gary Cooper , who I can take or leave , and especially by Jean Arthur , with whom it's relatively easy to fall in love . There was excellent support all round and the current economic situation even makes it relevant . Truly a classic .
409447	2567136	29947	9.0	The ( Big ) Cat's Pajamas	Even with a bad print - like the one I've just seen - the class shines through . It's mind-boggling to think that just after she made this gem Katie Hepburn acquired her infamous sobriquet ' box-office poison ' so quit Hollywood and persuaded Philip Barry to write a vehicle in which she could appear on Broadway ( the result , ' The Philadelphia Story ' was such a smash that MGM bought it and the film version was shown in a double bill with ' Baby ' earlier today . In his first screen writing credit Hagar Wilde ( who shared a writing credit with Dudley Nichols ) hit one out of the park . The script follows the Rules of farce ; an introductory scene , more or less ' straight ' which makes as many plot points as possible followed by a rapidly spiralling series of off-the-wall incidents that have their own demented logic . The opening scene establishes David Huxley ( Cary Grant ) as a zoologist who's spent several months assembling a creature from the Jurassic Age who even as we watch receives news that the final piece , an intercostal clavicle , has been located and is in the post . We learn also that he is engaged to Alice Swallow ( Virginia Walker ) who we know he will never marry if only because Katie Hepburn is Grant's co-star , they will marry on the morrow but tight-haired eyeglass-wearing Walker makes it clear that there will be no conjugal relations and reminds Huxley that he is due to play golf with the lawyer of a possible benefactress who may very well donate a sorely needed million dollars to the museum . From here we can go either way and Grant did just that in North By North West which he began as an equally normal citizen but this time became embroiled in dramatic rather than screwball progressions . Those first few minutes are the only thing even remotely resembling normality . At the golf course Susan Vance ( Hepburn ) plays Grant's ball and holes it on the 18th green and not content with that gets into his car instead of her own and writes it off before they both drive off leaving the lawyer - on the first hole - to his own devices . They meet again that evening in a night club and a third character , the ' crazy ' psychiatrist ( Fritz Feld ) is woven into the plot and we still haven't got to ' Baby ' , a leopard that Susan's brother has sent her from Brazil . It's easy to see why the French have so much time for Howard Hawks ; in his time he proved himself a master of several genres with such credits as Only Angels Have Wings , I Was A Male War Bride ( Grant again ) , Ball Of Fire , Red River , Rio Bravo , etc . Here he keeps all the balls spinning in the air as the likes of Walter Catlett ( Constable Slocum ) , May Robson ( Aunt Elizabeth ) , Charlie Ruggles ( Maj Horace Applegate ) and Barry Fitzgerald ( Gogarty ) keep the plot spinning just this side of out of control ( for good measure future names Jack Carson and Ward Bond make uncredited appearances . Though we may question exactly how much the usually sombre Nichols ( The Informer , Stagecoach , etc ) contributed to this zaniness it's really academic ; we have the finished product , that's all that matters .
408868	2567136	94105	9.0	Two For The Road	Another great movie from Leconte and one that marked a departure from the strictly laugh-filled movies he'd done up to this point . This one has everything , comedy , certainly , but seasoned with a dash of pathos and honest sentiment . Rochefort is outstanding as usual - not for nothing does Leconte use him time and time again - but the revelation is Gerard Jugnot , also best known at this time for strictly comedy roles , displaying a wonderfully sensitive side and limning a real ' human ' being foreshadowing by some fifteen years his standout performance in Les Choristes ( still , disgracefully , unshown commercially in London almost a year after its release in France and some six months after being released in HONG KONG ! ) . Jugnot plays Rivetot , mechanic , engineer , sidekick and general dogsbody to Rochefort's Mortez . Mortez is the host of a radio quiz show with which he has been touring France for several years but his penchant for gambling means there is very little in the kitty so that the two men are obliged to share twin-bedded rooms in each town they play . The radio station have effectively axed the show but Rivetot keeps the news from Mortez , knowing it would metaphorically kill him . This is a wonderful melange of laughter and tears and warm , human friendships and shows Leconte emerging as a consummate film maker .
408903	2567136	456396	9.0	Child's Play	The Dardenne brothers make it look easy . Their films have simple story lines , basic photography , little or no music and certainly no cgi but they do have exceptional acting which is , in the main , free from the kind of histrionics that some actors assume IS great acting . Once again they offer a simple plot ; Man meets Baby , Man sells Baby , Man finds Baby . On paper , so what , but on film this becomes absorbing . We are introduced to the protagonists economically ; Sonia ( Deborah Francois ) , holding her newborn son , searches for the father , Bruno ( Jeremie Renier ) and finally locates him ' at work ' i . e . in the middle of a scam . Bruno's idea of making a living consists of supplementing Sonia's State help with petty crime and spending the money as fast as he makes it . His new-born son is just something else off which he can make money . Only when Sonia collapses on hearing that Bruno has sold their child do we , the audience , become aware that there is actually something besides himself that Bruno cares about and that is Sonia . I can only echo the accolades that I have read in previous comments here . Despite its downbeat subject this is a wonderful film and fans of the Dardennes will no doubt savour the cameo by Olivier Gourmet , who appeared with Renier in La Promesse . Go see .
409652	2567136	430224	9.0	Hell Is Other People's Screenplays . . .	. . . brought lovingly to fruition . For those living until yesterday in a remote Galaxy on the Dark side of the Milky Way maybe I should explain that the late and Great Polish writer-director Krystian Kieslowski left among his papers three Screenplays , Heaven , Hell and Purgatory and now the fine Bosnian ( No Man's Land ) director Danis Tanovic has shot the second part so that what we have is a Polish screenplay directed by a Bosnian with a ( largely ) French cast . The result is harrowing but richly rewarding and Bergman buffs will feel right at home with the doom and gloom which is present in both the story and dark interiors . With actors of the calibre of Carole Bouquet , Manu Beart , Karin Viard , Jean Rochefort and Jacques Gamblin you'd have to work at screwing it up ( okay , Godard could make a pig's ear of it without trying but luckily he's unrivalled at ineptness and incompetence ) and Tanovic has scrupulously and perfectly captured the writer's intention . This is a film of nuances and ' moody ' to the nth degree with three sisters united by a common tragedy but distanced from each other in the present ; Karin Viard is the only one who visits mother ( Carole Bouquet ) long institutionalized and reduced to communicating via pencil and paper . Viard turns in a career-best performance as a bruised , repressed spinster , longing for companionship and Bouquet is not far behind completely deglamorized in straggly gray hair and a wonderful way with a curtain line . Marie Gillain is perhaps the most conventional character as the youngest sister who allows herself to become pregnant by a married Sorbonne Professor - played by Jacques Perrin finally escaping his fate as a top-and-tailer ; he played the narrator in both Cinema Paradiso and Les Choristes and is on on view currently in Le Petite Lieutenant - who kills himself rather than deal with the situation , and Manu Beart is the terminally unhappy wife of Jacques Gamblin . There's not a lot of joy on offer here but there are some beautifully realised cameos like the porter on the train who finally plucks up courage to approach Viard romantically after years of punching her ticket as she travels to the institution and accepts defeat of a sort - he chooses the day when the sisters have reunited and are travelling together - philosophically and Jean Rochefort as a fellow inmate of Bouquet who does little but sit on a bench but HOW he does it . If your idea of a great movie is American Pie you won't last five minutes with this one but if you value fine acting , directing and storytelling you'll want to go again .
410202	2567136	46874	9.0	Hagen Dazzler	No one ever accused Hollywood of Doing The Right Thing or of having even heard of integrity so if , after creating the role of Eliza Doolittle and playing it for more than five years in both New York and London Julie Andrews was thought unfit to play it in the film version then there was no way Paramount was going to let Uta Hagen - who picked up a Best Actress Tony Award for her portrayal of Georgie on Broadway - replicate her role in the film version of Clifford Odets last great Broadway play , nor , if it comes to that , would they even consider allowing Paul Kelly - by then a veteran of 166 films dating from the Silent era , and who had himself won a Best Actor Tony for Command Decision - to recreate his Frank Elgin when they had a CROONER lined up for the lead . As it turned out both Bing Crosby and Grace Kelly turned in fairly decent performances though William Holden left both of them dead in the water . Incredibly - in a realistic sense - Grace Kelly beat out Judy Garland in A Star Is Born for Best Actress Oscar for this role in which Academy Voting members clearly mistook a set of old clothes and ' dowdy ' make up for Great Acting . Clifford Odets started with a bang with his One-Act play Waiting For Lefty and followed it with some great full-length items such as Awake And Sing and Rocket To The Moon before being seduced by Hollywood . Beginning in 1941 with Clash By Night he wrote three of the finest plays in both his own career or indeed anyone's , following Clash By Night with The Big Knife in 1949 and The Country Girl in 1950 before ending his theatre career with The Flowering Peach in 1954 . It's ironic that George Seaton , utilising a fair percentage of Odet's dialogue from the play picked up a Best Screenplay Oscar for The Country Girl and we can only assume that it was given for his rewriting the main role of Frank Elgin to make him a singer who learns to act rather than vice versa . If you never saw the play then you won't be too bothered about this and if you have seen the play you'll probably concede that Seaton makes a decent enough fist of the transition but if you have seen the play what you will relish most of all are the unmistakable Odets virile lines that fight their way to the surface through the morass that Seaton has fashioned . In sum : a Great play rewritten into a Very Good film with a Great performance from Holden and two half-decent ones from Kelly and Crosby .
410195	2567136	40367	9.0	Love Among The Ruins	This has the Wilder stamp all over it ; cynical , trenchant , classy , stylish . It was common practice for Hollywood studios to use music associated with a given studio as background in subsequent films yet who but Wilder would select Isn't It Romantic as a background to sleaze and squalor , love among the ruins indeed . Jean Arthur excels as uptight Congresswoman Phoebe Frost , carefully finishing off a report before taking a look at Berlin from the air - reminding us of a previous character written by Wilder , Garbo's Ninotchka , who failed to be impressed by Paris initially . Frost is bringing a chocolate cake on behalf of one of her constituants in Iowa to Captain John Pringle , John Lund , and Arthur's performance is truly the frosting on this particular cake . The menage a trois is completed by Marlene Dietrich as Eric Von Shutelow who sings in a shady club called the Lorelei and was the mistress of a high-ranking Nazi currently in hiding . The only false note is the fact that with all the austerity on view - and not even owning a decent mattress til Lund trades his cake for one - Dietrich is able to boast three different expensive dresses , one for each of the three numbers she performs , accompanied , incidentally , by the uncredited Frederick Hollander , who composed all three . Even weakest link Lund , wooden at the best of times and not helped by having to utter such lines as ' you blonde flame-thrower ' , can't bring this down to less than . It was Wilder's last film of the forties and stands beside Double Indemnity and The Lost Weekend as the very cream of his output - not that The Major And The Minor or Five Graves To Cairo were chopped liver if anyone asks you , but this was just the right note with which to follow the disappointing The Emporer Waltz .
409541	2567136	44744	9.0	The Joker Is Wilde	This is , hands down , the definitive film version of Wilde's finest play rendering all others superfluous . Puffin Asquith made something of a specialty of adapting stage plays and his resume ' includes Pygmalion , Quiet Wedding , Cottage To Let , French Without Tears , plus the definitive film version ( the Albert Finney remake was a joke ) of the finest One-Act play ever written , Terry Rattigan's The Browning Version , in which Asquith and Redgrave teamed up yet again . Michael Redgrave was the outstanding Stage actor of his generation despite strong competition from Ralph Richardson , Johhny Gielgud and the overrated Larry Olivier but for better or worse he was associated with ' weighty ' roles , especially Shakespeare yet he possessed the lightest of touches when playing comedy as he demonstrates here where he leads a cast that would be difficult if not impossible to eclipse . From all accounts Edith Evans ' Lady Bracknell was one or two notches below her stage version in the ' classic ' John Gielgud version of the play some years earlier and if that is so then the stage performance may well have been out of this world . The other Michael in the cast ( Dennison , as Algy ) is not someone immediately linked with Wilde yet he brings it off exceptionally well which may be hardly surprising given it was his impetus that got the project off the ground . Miles Malleson and the ' amateur ' ( when Redgrave dared to praise her standout performance as Madame Arcati at an out-of-town preview of Blithe Spirit to the author , Noel Coward , he was taken aback when Coward seethed ' amateur ' and changed the subject ) Margaret Rutherford complement each other perfectly whilst Joan Greenford and newcomer ( in her film debut ) Dorothy Tutin round off a cast in which everyone has grasped the concept of speaking the Wildean epigrams with which it is studded as if they were the most banal clichés . Definitely one to savor .
409776	2567136	204709	10.0	Pawns In The Game Of Love	This movie proves that a wonderful film will overcome a stupid title that can only attract the wrong kind of audience . From the very first frame it's clear that the two protagonists who met only in the interests of pure unadulterated ( sorry about that ) sex are going to fall in love and it's just a question of watching it happen and seeing if it ends in tears . Once you get past the basic flaw - the kind of people who resort to sex magazines to look for partners usually do so because conventional methods have failed . They are either too old , too ugly , too short , too fat ( short AND fat will usually do it every time ) in fact the LAST thing they are is as gorgeous and desirable as Nathalie Baye and as handsome as Sergi Lopez - this is a wonderful film and I'm delighted to add my voice to all those others who have praised it on this board . I saw it on release some six years ago , long before I even knew of this website and I've just seen it again and admired it even more . A definite .
410032	2567136	43338	10.0	Aces Back To Back	As if to rub viewers noses in his versatility Billy Wilder shot Sunset Boulevard and this one back to back with Sunset being released one year earlier in 1950 . Not surprisingly a failure on its release this movie is as good a definition of Wilder as any in his vast and impressive repertoire indeed the words cynic , cynicism and cynical might have been invented to describe the typical Wilder film . As always he had no time for ' fancy ' shots and angles - in Wilder everything is couched in ' traditional ' Long , Medium , Close and the standard variations , Medium-Close , etc , but he does shoot a couple of low angles sparingly here and uses Chuck Tatum's body walking toward and blocking the camera and then walking away again to illustrate a time-lapse , the twelve months that Tatum has been cooling his heels in New Mexico . The exposition is equally brilliant with Tatum ( Kirk Dougles ) flaunting his journalistic CV and explaining to his protégé that one story is all it takes to make it back to the big time and how , when such a story appears , a smart reporter will milk it to the full and then , of course , he proceeds to do just that when Leo Mimosa gets trapped in a cave and Tatum works the angles to keep him there . For those caring to look for them there are parallels with Sunset Boulevard - the audience who flock to see a Norma Desmond and / or a Leo Mimosa and then , once the novelty has worn off , turns away from them and in both cases it was skillful PR work and / or intrepid reporters who brought them to the attention of the audience in the first place . Wilder liked to use actors more than once and both Porter Hall and Richard Gaines appeared in both Double Indemnity and this one . Religious overtones abound both overtly in Leo's conviction that the ' Gods ' are angry with him because he ' steals ' their artifacts and a tad less overtly in Jan Sterling - as Leo's floozy wife Lorraine - taking a bite out of an apple whilst trying crudely to tempt Tatum , and Sheriff Ray Teal's pet rattler . Just as Bill Holden's Joe Gillis thought he'd landed on the gravy train only to wind up on the wrong end of a bullet so Chuck Tatum in Wilder's very next film winds up on the wrong end of a pair of scissors ; like Crime , Cynicism Does Not Pay . A small masterpiece .
409402	2567136	38238	10.0	The Way To The ( Ten ) Stars	This is one of those ' period ' films replete with the kind of dialogue that we've heard ' sent up ' a thousand times and responded to the send ups by laughing at them but this film that SHOULD be faintly risible holds the attention and inspires tears rather than laughter . This is probably because it is as finely crafted as a Faberge egg or a Louis VIII commode . The screenplay is the work of Terence Rattigan , one of the finest English playwrights of the 20th century - indeed even a cursory glance at the relationship between Joyce Cary and her niece Renee Asherson reveals a blueprint for the Mrs Railton-Bell and daughter Sybil in Rattigan's Separate Tables which lay a good ten years in the future - who could and did turn his hand to the screenplay usually successfully as in The Sound Barrier . Michael Redgrave , destined to star magnificently in Rattigan's The Browning Version ( directed , as here , by Puffin Asquith ) stands out as the dashing and charming pilot who disappears far too soon having flown without his ' lucky ' lighter and gone down in flames . Rattigan's strength as a writer of wartime drama is in concentrating on the people rather than the battles so that the planes are seen taking off and landing at Halfpenny Field and that is all . The ensemble cast complement each other perfectly from John Mills raw recruit maturing into a leader to Stanley Holloway's hotel bore . One of the finest of its kind .
409268	2567136	53604	10.0	- Wise Guys	This is as close as makes no difference to the very best of Billy Wilder and that is , essentially , the Best of the Best . We'd be here all day if I were to list EVERY great Wilder film but the majority are great on one level - Double Indemnity , The Lost Weekend , Ace In The Hole , Sunset Boulevard , great Drams all ; Some Like It Hot , The Major And The Minor , A Foreign Affair , One , Two , Three , great comedies , but with The Apartment Wilder moves effortlessly from satire ( the four wise guys who monopolise the apartment and see everything as corporate-wise , situation-wise , promotion-wise , Kubelik-wise etc ) . through comedy to drama without missing a beat . The writing is breathtaking and coupled brilliantly to visuals that move the story along like the cracked compact mirror and Wilder isn't afraid to give the most minor character a good line - witness the Santa in the bar who walks into the scene and says ' my sleigh is double-parked ' and later , when the bartender is waiting to close and asks if the drunk realizes what night it is he replies ' I work for the outfit ' . In the same scene , of course , is another fully realized character , Margie , whose jockey husband is in gaol in Havana for doping horses . Virtually everyone puts in top-of-the-line performances ( even Shirley MacLaine is not as hard to take as usual ) from the four horsemen of Baxter's apocalypse to Edie Adams , to Fred McMurray , Jack Kruschen but towering head and shoulders above everyone is the brilliant Jack Lemon running the gamut from A to BEYOND Z . Coming up to half a century old and STILL better than most of the stuff coming out of Hollywood today . A true classic .
