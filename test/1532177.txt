469907	1532177	94611	1.0	Inaccurate , Contrived And Full Of Plot Holes	! ! ! ! ! ! SPOILERS ! ! ! ! ! ! - And no I'm not making any of this upMy first and only viewing of ACT OF BETRAYAL was way back in 1988 and it's a sign of an extremely poor mini series that I can still remember all its flaws 15 years on The central plot alone is a major problem : IRA man Michael McGurk turns supergrass after a bombing on London that leaves several civilians dead . He and his family are given safe haven to Australia under witness protection to start a new life and the IRA command in the Republic of Ireland hire an American hitman called Callaghan to kill the McGurk family . There are several obvious problems with this scenario . Didn't McGurk ever realise that the provisional IRA are a terrorist organisation ? I'm just kind of curious as to why he was so angry about innocent civilians being killed when it has been happening for 20 years ? Perhaps he thought he joined GreenPeace by mistake ? And his naming names wouldn't have led to IRA men being jailed as seen here . Internment in Northern Ireland had been stopped in the mid 1970s which meant for a conviction to be gained in terrorist trials in the province hard evidence such as forensics were needed to jail terrorists , statements from a supergrass would never stand up in a Northern Ireland court . And why would the IRA employ an American hitman ? I was under the impression they have their own execution squads . And there's a factual error in having the IRA command in the Republic Of Ireland , since the split between the officials and provisionals in 1970 the provisionals IRA command has been based in the north not the republic . As the plot goes on it gets more and more contrived , Michael starts an affair with some Aussie blonde with republican sympathies while his wife starts having strong feelings towards the special branch officer guarding them ( I guess that's why the word betrayal features in the title ? ) , the officer goes home to Belfast where he is abducted and dies at the hands of the IRA who find a plane ticket from Australia and a cuddly toy Kangeroo which makes realise the McGurks are in Oz and via Michael's extra marital lover who unknowingly gives away too much information Callaghan manages to track down the McGurks . Yes that's right a massive country like Australia with a population of over 20 million people and a hitman can still track you down even though you've changed your identity and all because you fancied some extra marital sex with a blonde bimbo ! As far as I know ACT OF BETRAYAL was shown only once on British television and considering it makes PATRIOT GAMES and THE DEVIL'S OWN look like documentaries it was shown once too often
469766	1532177	300214	1.0	Utter And Absolute Garbage	As other people on this page have pointed out the plot for MORVERN CALLAR is thus : Girl wakes up to find her boyfriend has committed suicide . He leaves her his unpublished novel . She sells it . The end . There's hardly enough material there for a short film never mind a feature length movie and this fact becomes more and more obvious as director Lynne Ramsay fills up the running time with scenes that either outlive their usefullness by several minutes or are completely superflous in driving the plot . In fact that's the whole problem with the movie , the director is unable to inject any type of narrative drive to the proceedingsI could spend several paragraphs telling you how much I detested this anally retentive piece of art house crap but you get the picture so I won't bother you needlessly since unlike Lynne Ramsay I can get to the point . I will point out that MORVERN CALLAR has won awards which means nothing since " Former " terrorists have won the Noble peace prize and it's shocking a film this audience unfriendly was awarded funding
470289	1532177	240515	1.0	Neds Only	A conversation I overheard in Rothesay on the Isle Of Bute : 1st Ned : Wassa film called man ? 2nd Ned : Freddy got fingered man . It's fin ' brilliant man . You should watch it man , it's a good laugh manWhat's a ned ? It's a common expression in Scotland . It should actually be written in capital letters since it's an acronym for Non Educated Delinquent Scum ( NEDS ) . It's a sort of Scottish version of redneck scumbags , though I do hope that the worst redneck scumbag has more critical awareness when it comes to cinema , in which case rednecks won't want to see FREDDY GOT FINGEREDThe film actually starts off very well with Tom Green skateboarding through a shopping arcade pursued by security guards . The reason this scene is so good is because it has been totally inspired by TRAINSPOTTING . The film decides to then go its own way ( Bad move ) and the audience ( Well the neds in the audience ) are treated to some classic hilarity like Tom Green pulling a horse's plonker , Tom Green running around with a deer carcass around him and Tom Green eating a sandwich while watching two horses get it on . Oh and did I mention every single scene has foul language and Tom Green speaking in a bloody stupid voice ? Well every scene does so don't say I didn't warn you , and to think I slagged off SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT 3 in a previous review , compared with this garbage SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT 3 was the masterwork of a comic geniusTHE TOM GREEN SHOW is also utter crap so I've written two reviews for the price of one and if you're reading this Tom Green why don't you come and live on the Island Of Bute for the rest of your life on welfare ? You'll be in good company amongst the neds and the rest of the human race won't have to put up with your brand of so called comedy
468811	1532177	70423	2.0	This Film Is Sick	Original is not a word to describe THE MUTATIONS . To sum up its plot it's a hybrid between a mad scientist film and FREAKS . Unoriginality is not enough to condemn it of course , but what makes THE MUTATIONS a truly terrible film is the fact that it's so sickening . When Tod Browning made FREAKS in the 1930s disabilty and deformatity were I imagine treated differently in those days . Not so in the 1970s when the concept of a traveling " freakshow " wouldn't have drawn an audience . Indeed it's highly unlikely any council would have allowed it to take place on the grounds of taste due to a public outcry . There's no way I'd pay to go and see that and I feel disgusted I watched a film where people with real deformaties are used in the name of entertainment . Perhaps the saddest one was " The skeleton woman " who looked like she'd just been rescued from a Nazi death camp . SPOILERS ( though how can I spoil your " enjoyment " of this filth is beyond me ) I've outlined a good enough reason not to watch it , but may I also point out that this film is also extremely sloppy and underdeveloped in terms of script and production too . For example the hero gets turned into a man eating plant and for no reason consumes a drunken passerby . I say for no reason because he can still control his human emotions which he demonstrated in the previous scene by talking to his girlfriend and demonstrates it again at the end by attacking the villain in his lab . And this action scene seems to have been directed , edited and had make - up artists by people who were too untalented to have worked on the worst school play production . Still it could have been worse , if the rest of the film is anything to go by the production crew might have dug up a decomposed corpse and used that for the villain's death scene . And get ready for a final shock plot twist at the end though how can anyone be shocked by the final scene when we've already seen exploitation of the worst sort leaves me pondering . You're probably asking yourself why I decided to watch THE MUTATIONS all the way through instead of switching it off in disgust ? Make no mistake this film did disgust and disturb me . Well it did star a pre-fame Tom Baker as Donald Pleasence's henchman . I can watch anything with Baker in it and to see him play a nasty piece of work does have a certain novelty value Check out VAULT OF TERROR ) , but even that didn't stop wanting to swith off the TV frequently . And for my sins I had to get into a warm soapy bath afterwards and scrub myself clean , That's how much THE MUTATIONS disgusted me
469643	1532177	109040	2.0	Is This A Family Comedy ?	You have to worry about how some producers market a movie . ACE VENTURA PET DETECTIVE is a case in point . It's about a detective who loves animals , he keeps all sorts of furry and feathered friends in his house and there's nothing more family friendly than a movie featuring lovely animals , you can just see the little ones begging mom and dad to take them to the cinema to see this movie . Just to hammer the point home the main plot centres around a dolphin mascot being kidnapped and there's nothing more heartbreaking to a family audience than a dolphin in peril So with got a set up and plot that Walt Disney would have been proud of and what do the producers do ? They decide to inject lots of crude humour into it . I was going to write " Crude adult humour " but it's not even sophisticated enough to reach the standards of adult . Are there any adults who think references to veneral disease are funny ? Will children get the in jokes to THE CRYING GAME ? I should hope not . Bizarrely the BBC decided to show this earlier today at a traditional family slot in the early evening which proves the BBC know as little about movies as the average Hollywood producer That's bad enough but what really disgusted me is that ACE VENTURA PET DETECTIVE turned Jim Carrey into a film star . Now that is unforgivable
469044	1532177	66212	2.0	I Can't Believe The High Rating	Heist movies play out in an identical formula : Character A meets character B who introduces them to character C . They pull off a scam and it becomes a race for characters A , B and C to stab each other in the back The only difference between PERFECT Friday and other heist movies is that this one is possibly the worst directed one of the lot . Watch the scene near the start when Britt is introduced to Mr Hall in the bank . There supposed to be facing each other but by some ridiculous editing it looks like they're talking to each other's backs when the camera cuts between them . I also couldn't help noticing the poor sound editing which makes every interior scene sound like it was filmed in an empty room regardless of the location Even people who liked this movie mention Peter Hall's bizarre directing . I'm not mentioning it - I'm complaining about and helps make an already boring and unlikely story unwatchable , and I'm shocked that PERFECT Friday has an average user rating of 6 . 9
469411	1532177	256155	2.0	The Horror	To say this is a JAWS rip off does not do justice as to how bad this is , in fact the only compatant bits are the monster P . O . V shots stolen from the JAWS franchise . This is film making at its absolute nadir , it'd be impossible to make a film worse than this on purpose . Everyone has already commented the mistakes like the American ambulances and the god awful ( Non ) Scottish accents , the poor acting etc , but has anyone mentioned the goof that dynamite ISN'T freely avalaible in Scotland ? Or that the police uniforms aren't the same ones seen in Scotland ? And has anyone pointed out how poor the dialogue is ? " A lotta people want you out of here " Aye Scottish film goers obviously " You not wanted round here here " Aye definately scottish film goers " I'm really sorry for what happened " No doubt said by everyone involved in the making of this tripe " I could do better with a ( A high St brand of camera ) " No doubt said by everyone who's seen this tripe . Also notice the product placement . So that's how this film was funded " We need something that'll keep us in work " Subtle post modernist excuse for making this tripe " We don't need any help round here " Oh no ? What about acting lessons , screenwriting classes , film school etc ? " Why don't you go back to the States to find bigfoot or Elvis Pressley ? " Maybe they could also find a decent script , director , editor , producer and actors while they're there " Sheep got a headache ? " Oh right like the Welsh , Aussies and New Zealanders the Jocks are sheep lovers are they ? Doubt if anyone in this film would have the guts to say that in Scotland especially after watching this tripe it's obvious they have no idea where ScotlandPS A flock of sheep with headaches could have made a better film than this
469297	1532177	361596	2.0	Another Overlong Polemical Diatribe Complete With Massive Self Contradictions	If BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE was subjective and somewhat inaccurate there can be no adjectives used to describe FARENHEIT . It is polemical documentary making of the worse sort that will change no ones mind on anything in which case it deserves to be ignored , but since there seems to be a cult that think Michael Moore is the greatest thing that's happened to humanity for two thousand years a few points . Moore asks if the hijackers were Saudis why didn't America invade Suai Arabia instead of Afghanistan ? The same reason Britain didn't invade the Republic of Ireland in the 1970s to defeat the IRA because as the Irish Republic didn't train , arm , or fund the provisional IRA neither does the government of Saudi Arabia train , arm or fund Al Qaeda . In fact Al-Qaeda has vowed to over throw the Saudi government ( Same as during the 1970s the IRA vowed to over throw the Republic's government ) and replace it with an Islamic theocracy . For someone who's supposedly educated Moore should have known this and she should also know that Taliban controlled Afghanistan was indeed being used as a massive terrorist training camp for Islamic terrorists from all over the world , same as he should know that the Taliban and Mujahedeen are two different things and that the " Northern Alliance " who fought the Taliban since 1996 were effectively the Mujahedeen . Moore doesn't state that both the Taliban and Mujahedeen are the same entity but by using choice words like " Afghans " and " Islamic fundamentalists fighting the Russians " that's what he is trying to imply to his unquestioning fan baseTalking of Afghanistan leads us to the main problem with FARENHEIT - The internal self contradiction . In 2001 Moore publicly criticised the invasion of Afghanistan saying there was no evidence that Bin Laden was involved and as the documentary states earlier the hi-jackers were Suadis not Afghans . In short Moore is against the invasion of Afghanistan but then spends time telling his audience that because Bush didn't into Afghanistan quick enough and without enough men this allowed Bin Laden to escape . What is Moore trying to say ? That if he was in charge he's had invaded Afghanistan quicker and with more men ? What are you saying Mickey ? There's another similar point with similar illogical points that come across as self contradictions : Moore laments that the anti terrorist laws are repressive then points out a few seconds later that there's not enough state funding to police the border areas of Oregon . Moore's against the anti-terror legislation but he wants more border security to police the anti - terror laws ? Is that what he's saying ? He also makes it quite clear in the same segment that Fresno peace groups don't look like terrorists . Indeed they don't and no one has ever came up with any criteria as to what an average terrorist looks like . Go to the Gaza strip or West Bank and you'll see that the average terrorist looks like the average man , woman ( Or in some extreme cases ) child except that they're skin is a slightly different shade from that of the average Fresno peace group member . Is Moore being latently racist I wonder ? In keeping with the same irony / self contradiction the best worst bits from the documentary take place in Iraq , a country we're led to believe that was under Saddam a beautiful utopia where children played on the streets , men and woman sat outside street corner cafes with well prepared inexpensive lunches and everyone smiled only to have everything ruined by a war of aggression by America . We're then shown dead Iraqi babies and American wounded screaming in pain . Shocking scenes but one without any context . We're not shown say , the thousands of Kurds who were murdered by Iraqis during the 1980s , or the Kuwaits who were murdered by Saddams forces in 1990 or the hundreds of thousands of Iranians who were killed by Saddams forces during the Gulf war of the 1980s . War is always a sickening business featuring the very worst of human nature - I mean if Michael Moore had a film camera and gone to the Serb held areas of Bosnia in 1995 after NATO air-strikes he could have filmed similar scenes amongst civilian casualties , same as he might have if he showed the aftermath of NATO air-strikes against Serbia in 1999 . I wonder why he didn't ? Was it because the Democrats were in the White House at the time ? You might like to remember that Moore backed Wesley Clark as the Democratic nomination in the race for the White House , the same Wesley Clark who was in charge of the NATO air-strikes in the Balkans that killed civilians I could say much more on this polemical piece of nonsense like Moore's ridiculous oil pipeline theory but I won't bother since like this fantasy drama from Moore no one will have their minds changed . I will say one thing though , as unlikely as it may seem by reading this review I was against the invasion of Iraq even though I could understand the reasons behind it and Dubya would have stood or fallen via the 2004 American presidential vote on this decision . Moore had nothing to lose by making this documentary and because of his unquestioning fan base everything to gain . If Dubya hadn't invaded Iraq we wouldn't have got FARENHEIT so enjoy the money and awards this movie brings you Mickey because people died for it
469353	1532177	158242	2.0	Very Predictable	! ! ! ! POSSIBLE SPOILERS FOR ANYONE WHO'S NEVER SEEN A TVM ! ! ! ! The problem with STORM CHASERS is that it's a TVM which means . . . The budget is low . This means that instead of seeing a terrible tornado we're instead shown the aftermath of a terrible tornado which is composed of film footage and a " Tent City " set up in a car park The main protagonist / hero is a ballsy woman who doesn't take any nonsense off men , especially nonsense off well buffed hunky menThe ballsy woman ends up with a romantic interlude with a well buffed hunky man she intially disliked The ballsy woman saves the day Very predictable stuff that seems somewhat belated to tie in with TWISTER . The lovey dovey stuff seems to overwhelm the side plot involving a research facility which led me to think that the TVM would have worked better if the producers had upped the conspiracy theory aspects a lot more but the science used is just plain stupid so perhaps they shouldn't have bothered in the first place As everyone else is keen to point out it's fairly inoffensive ( Compared to the previous movie I'd seen tonight THE LIFE OF STUFF it's CITIZEN KANE in comparison ) but I couldn't help wondering what Kelly McGillis was doing in a low brow TVM . This the actress who won plaudits in WITNESS , TOP GUN and THE ACCUSED . I guess a lot can happen in ten years
469493	1532177	59243	2.0	Very Dated	I'm amazed this comedy is so highly rated because I found it very dated in its type of slapstick comedy . The first twenty minutes seem to be entirely composed of Jack Lemmon's villain standing behind some oh so obvious back projection trying to scupper the plans of Tony Curtis good guy . As the film progresses I became aware that Lemmon is best at giving subtle bitter sweet performances , not an over the top baddie so broadly written that even Laurel and Hardy would have complained about the amount of silly slapstick involved . Long before the movie had ended I was wondering what Lemmon was doing in this role I couldn't help noticing that many of the people heaping praise upon THE GREAT RACE were very young when they saw it on its original release in 1965 . This probably explains why they have a soft spot for it . I'm afraid that I have never been a fan of slapstick and never will be so I have very little kind words for a comedy whose main selling point is that it features the biggest custard pie fight in history
468383	1532177	217370	3.0	Avoid	THE TOM BAKER YEARS differs very much from the previous three YEARS tapes , all of Baker's episodes existed in the BBC archives unlike the William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton eras ( Which was the original idea behind the Hartnell and Troughton YEARS tapes ) so here we see Tom Baker commenting on a clip from every story he starred in . You could vaguely describe this as a precurser to the commentary tracks used on present day DVD features but that would probably be too kind as I get the feeling it was released just to fleece DOCTOR WHO fans . The clips shown are more often than not poor choices with a clip from Genesis Of The Daleks being devoid of any Daleks or their creator Davros while The Invasion Of Time clip doesn't feature the Sontarans who are one of the most popular villains from the series . Worst of all THE TOM BAKER YEARS was released on a two tape set costing £20 when it could have easily have fitted on a single tape for ten quid Baker makes a gives a few anecdotes and has a dead pan sense of humour , but often he fails to remember details or names of stories , forgets the name of aliens and even fails to recall the name of one of his assistants ( She's called Leela ) which leads me to believe it's a tape designed just to cash in on the show's popularity amongst die hard fans . It's worth watching if you can borrow a copy for free but I'd certainly avoid paying money to see it
470196	1532177	395443	3.0	The Title Sums It Up	Many years ago there was a contributer to this website called Tim Cox who wrote countless reviews which never seem to be composed of much more than three lines . I noticed the director of ALIEN LOCKDOWN is also called Tim Cox and I wonder if they're both the one and the same since one's respective reviews are as threadbare as this movie The title tells you everything you need to know about the plot . Scientists messing around with nature and it's up to a bunch of macho US marines to try and save the day , most of whom get eaten by the eponymous monster . I guess Mr Cox deserves some credit since it's obvious he doesn't have a Cameron style budget to play with . Maybe that's why he seems to have overused a green filter on the camera in order to disguise the poor production values ?
469704	1532177	253798	3.0	Something Of A Guilty Pleasure . . .	. . . Except there's no pleasure involved and I'd feel kind of guilty not warning you this is a very unfunny comedy I guess the producers were trying to dig into the market of the American Pie demographics or possibly of the SCARY MOVIE fans and in many ways it does seem to try to emulate the near the knuckle humour of these film series except at the last moment it pulls back . How many times watching this movie do you feel there's going to be a gross out punchline then at the very last moment it's cancelled ? This gives the whole film a very bizarre feel There's a vague plot involved with a property land developer trying to buy a snowboard resort but at no time does this feel cohesive to the screenplay in anyway because thge screenplay seems more concerned at trying to fit as many predictable , juveniule , unfunny gags as it can within the running time . It also says something when the two most famous cast members are Lee Majors and Victoria SilvstedtOUT COLD gave my funny bone frost bite
469181	1532177	131352	3.0	If This Isn't Unoriginal I Don't Know What Is	" Something is missing " whines John Larkin . I quite agree , an original script is missing , not to mention a big name star , a director who has made more than just TVMs , and a big budget . For the first ten minute of the film - oooopps sorry I mean TVM . There is a difference - the plot involves an everyman type suffering from strange dreams , finds his wife and lifestyle are not what they seem and discovers himself to be a hunted man . At any second I was expecting the line " If I'm not me then who the hell am I ? " to come out . Guess what film I'm referring to ? Sorry but Timothy Hutton isn't big Arnie or Jean Claude Van Damme , but he's not Steven Segal either so I guess DEAD BY MIDNIGHT could be worse and it does contain a mind blowing scene where the bad guy turns up at an orphanage and gives the long suffering TV viewer a good laugh with some of the worst acting I have ever seen
468979	1532177	131646	3.0	I've Never Played The Game But . . .	. . . I imagine it must be a hundred times more entertaining than this sorry excuse of a movie and I make no apologies for pointing out what a terrible piece of film making it is . An alien invasion force launches an attack on the human race and proceeds towards planet Earth and it's up to some fighter pilots to stop them . Well hope the defenders put far more effort into stopping them than the producers put effort into making this movie - It's really awful . I mean what's the point of hiring such talented actors as Suchet , Prochnow and Warner if you're going to give them a zero dimensional character and stilted lines ? having said that the decent cast members still give a performance good enough to show that the rest of the cast like Burrows and Prinze Jr are pretty rank . Yeah okay maybe it's not a film that an audience are going to watch for the cast but I imagine the original video game had much better FX and graphics as seen here . Words fail to describe how painfully bad the technical attributes of this movie are . When I say THE MUMMY RETURNS had better CGI that says everything you will ever need to know about WING COMMANDER
469518	1532177	66561	3.0	When Britain Made Some Crap Movies	I remember watching this aged about eleven and not thinking much of it then and when I watched it on Sky movies a couple of weeks ago I liked it even less . What's wrong with the movie can be summed up with the opening scene where a bunch of bikini clad blondes are going to be sacraficed . If the time period is set " when dinosaurs ruled the Earth " how come there's human beings ? As every boorish schoolboy knows dinosaurs died out millions of years before primative man walked the surface of the planet . Oh and the voice over informs us there's no moon which is another anachronism . BTW why are the blondes going to be sacraficed ? To increase the collective IQ of humanity ? Actually watching this film as an adult male I was very impressed by the costume design or rather the lack of it . Yup it's a Hammer production so you just know that the female cast were chosen because of their lung capacity , but this leads me to ask : If that's what women looked like in the stone age how come it took hundreds of thousands of years for the population to reach six billion ? Costume design aside the rest of the production values are very poor , much of the location exteriors were obviously filmed in a studio with sea borne scenes filmed in a swimming pool and it goes without saying the ( Not very special ) special effects are of a DOCTOR WHO standardBe warned that if you're writing an article on stone age man don't use this film as a source of information . I've already pointed out some mistakes and here's some more things that are difficult to accept1 ) In the stone age everyone had perfect teeth2 ) In the stone age people from different tribes had no problem understanding one another if they pointed their fingers3 ) Dinosaurs always make the same screeching noise no matter what species they belong to4 ) When a dinosaur hatches from an egg it grows to adulthood within a few hours5 ) Animals like snakes and crabs were a lot bigger in the stone age6 ) If a cave woman has blonde hair she will almost always have brown eyes , while a cave man with dark hair will almost always have blue eyes indicating that genetics were somehow different in the stone age
469080	1532177	339542	3.0	Tries To Be Two Things At Once And Fails	I problem I have with this documentary is that it can't decide to be about viruses or about the making of 28 DAYS LATER so it tries to be both and considering it lasts for 20 minutes it fails on both attempts . The making of 28 DAYS LATER segments are very predictable composed mainly of actors telling us how they got in shape for the part and what it's like firing a gun , but the segments with the scientists talking about the possible dangers to humanity posed by viruses is very disappointing . It's patently obvious that none of the scientists interviewed have any knowledge of the film otherwise they'd have mentioned the ridiculously short incubation period of rage . And I also got the feeling the interviews were severly edited in order to sensationalise them . Yes a superbug is very dangerous and some of them are resistant to antibiotics but this is because doctors have been overprescribing antibiotics for years something not mentioned here . Similarly the devastation caused by the foot and mouth outbreak in Britain last year is mentioned but it wasn't mentioned that the mountains of animal carcasses was caused by laws that require a completely healthy herd of cattle to be slaughtered if only one of them was infected . It wasn't the foot and mouth virus that devastated British agriculture last year ( How could it when most of the slaughtered livestock weren't infected ? ) but laws drawn up to stop the disease spreading . Not only is foot and mouth harmless to all humans but it's also non fatal to most farmyard livestock - it just makes them sick and loose a lot of weight . So " A virus similar to foot and mouth disease sweeping through the human race " doesn't scare me very much
468757	1532177	110419	3.0	Some People Might Like It	This starts with Angus MacGyver and his old college professor Fat Shouting Actor Atticus going on a little jaunt to the Balkans to pick up some artifacts . You think being educated men Angus and Atticus would have picked up the artifacts before or after everyone in the region started killing one another but if they did that we wouldn't have a story . Strangely enough the first act is completely disposable and seems to exist only as a social conscience so we can hear MacGyver spouting lines like " mYou're committing ethnic cleansing , racial genocide " . Perhaps the worst thing about this is that you find yourself questioning if this is the right platform for people to be making these kind of speeches , I mean MACGYVER is supposed to be a fun show so should it be concerning itself with real life geo-political issues ? I mean in THE A TEAM no one came out with " The Republicans are obesessed with neo liberal market forces , so by helping ourselves we're not doing anything Reagan isn't doing " . You also can't help noticing that " The Balkans look suspiciously like Battersea Power Station in London . Guess where this sequence was filmed ? After being hit over the head as to why ethnic cleansing and racial genocide are bad things MacGyver and Atticus depart " The Balkans " and go to London ( Ha Ha Ha But they've been in London the whole time - I meant another part of London ) where the plot is explained and Angus and Atticus embark on an adventure to an exotic location - Actually a quarry . A lot of people describe this TVM as an Indiana Jones rip off but it's more in keeping with DOCTOR WHO since no matter where in the universe the characters go it always ends up looking like a few minutes drive from London Fans of MACGYVER might like this feature length adventure ( Most probably the 100 or so people who worked on it and gave on this site ) but I didn't
469994	1532177	114663	3.0	Too Much Cheese . Too Much Boredom	THREE WISHES revolves around the story of Jeanne a widow whose husband is believed killed during the Korean war . One day she runs down and injures derelict drifter Jack and is so guilt stricken she invites him home to look after him That's the story set up and as you can tell it's not the most credible premise you'll ever see , it might have worked better if the premise led to a thriller whose subtext screams " kindness will be the death of you " but here the opposite happens as we're hit over the head that " Kindness will be rewarded " . Obviously this movie is a fantasy This might have been bad enough but not bad enough to condemn the movie out right , but where the film falls down is something that a great number of reviewers on this page have pointed out - The director fails to bring any excitement to the pace . Watching THREE WISHES I kept thinking I was watching a sub standard Frank Capra script directed by Steven Spielberg who was having an over sentimental off day . It's a very inoffensive movie but also a very cheesy uninvolving one too BTW if I had three wishes , I'd make everyone in the world equal , then I'd make some people more equal than others , then I'd make myself the most equal person in the whole wide world . Strangely none of the characters in this movie ever considered anything like this
468573	1532177	208003	3.0	Very Lazy Comedy	The premise for BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE is something we've seen in countless other movies : A bad ass criminal escapes from jail , the cops have a rough idea where he's going to a couple of cops have to trap him . We've seen this type of plot in 48 HOURS , STAKEOUT and countless other films . I'm afraid I have to point out that we've seen a similar type of plot in countless other better films ! The problem isn't just with the very lazy plot that must have taken all of five minutes to have thought up but it's with the comedy itself . It tries to appeal to the sort of people who enjoyed both SCARY MOVIE and MRS DOUBTFIRE . Believe me very few people would have enjoyed both the gross out humour of SCARY MOVIE with the more traditional farce of MRS DOUBTFIRE . When Martin Lawrence says the line " I've seen some scary sht in my time but . . . " I honestly thought he was talking about the script , scary in the way that someone thought this was going to set the box office alight . A very short review for a film that's very short on laughs
468961	1532177	205936	4.0	Reminds Me Of Other ( Poor ) British Comedy Thrillers	FIVE SECONDS TO SPARE is yet another British movie made at the turn of the century that can't decide want it wants to be and instantly reminded me of countless other British films that came out at the same time proving yet again that if you want to get your movie financied knowing people in the business is imperative while possessing screen writing skills is not a priority The story starts with our protagonist William witnessing a gruesome murder . The narrative then jumps back in time and shows us that William is a budding musician who has moved to London as a career move . It's at this point FIVE SECONDS TO SPARE decides it's going to be a comedy and I can't communicate how the opening murder jars with everything else in the story . Anyone seen YOUNG SOUL REBELS ? This was another British movie that opened with a murder then for some inexplicable reason decided it was going to be about the London soul scene in the 1970s . If a movie starts with a bloody murder shouldn't it remain a thriller and not become a comedy ? The movie also suffers from too many pointless cameos . Anyone seen MAD COWS ? We've got John Peel playing himself along with Ray Winston playing . . . well Ray Winston . We've also got Sean Pertwee who obviously just turned up so he could say he's appeared in every British movie made in the last five years and since Keith Allen was busy that week we've got Andy Serkis playing Allen's role . If the " Brit Pack " want to get together can't they just meet up at someones house instead of producing a movie ? And like MAD COWS the humour is silly and unconvincing instead of being funny I could spend a lot of time dissecting what is wrong with this movie but I can't really be bothered except to say it's yet another British movie that was rushed into production with a painfully underdeveloped script . No doubt the people who worked on FIVE SECONDS TO SPARE had a great time unlike the audience and if you've got a couple of hours to spare I'm sure it can be spent more wisely than watching this
469272	1532177	290334	4.0	" Something's Wrong " - Yeah The Script	SPOILERS I wasn't all that taken with the original X-MEN movie but since it was the introduction of a franchise I forgave the flaws like the underdeveloped themes of antagonism between the humans and mutants . X-2 has no such excuses however since the plot revolves around Magneto and a rogue human general trying to start a war between the humans and mutants . Well I used the word " Plot " but just like in a Roger Moore Bond film or a typical Hollywood summer blockbuster the plot gets drowned out by explosions , stunts and special effects It's here I wish to absolve the screenwriters for most of the blame of a muddled underdeveloped story because I can imagine the screenplay being repeatedly returned to the writers with a note saying " Okay Jean and Wolverine are in love but there's not enough teen romance so introduce a couple of teen characters " and " The boys at special effects have come up with a new morphing effect so write a few scenes where we can show it off " Note to Hollywood studios - If you think writing a screenplay is so easy try writing one . Then after you've done that write another one and anotherRegardless of the pressure they were under there is a couple of things the writers are guilty of and that's the mutants using their special powers to escape from a tight spot . F-16s on the tail of the escaping X-Men , I bet Storm can conjure up a few twisters . Yup thought so and this type of cheating takes place far too often but the fundamental error lies in a way a character is killed . If Jean dies at the end of the film it's logical that Jean should be the focus of the story but for some reason it's Wolverine who's the focus for much of the story which is a blunder on the part of the screenwriters So I wasn't too keen on this sequel at all and as recent blockbusters like LORD OF THE RINGS and THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL show a good memorable fantasy adventure is down to a script that allows good actors to act and have special effects that arise naturally from the story . Cramming a film with special effects just isn't enough any more
468794	1532177	91178	4.0	A Weak Horror Comedy	If you watch the opening title sequence you can easily understand the problem with the rest of the movie : A transvestite falls dying against a window consciously telling the audience " It's not what you think , it's not what you think " . Seconds later something stirs in the bushes back to camera , the figure turns and we see it is a werewolf - then the action cuts to a radio studio ! And that sums up the movie . Camp transvestites are not laugh inducing while sequences that reveal the previous action was part of radio play is akin to someone waking up and discovering it was a bad dream . Bad dream sequence = bad movie I know that fusing comedy with horror is never easy but when you've got some talented people behind and in front of the camera you should demand more . Gene Wilder directs and he worked on YOUNG FRANKENSTIEN . Trying to tell me he forgot everything he knew from that classic comedy horror ? I also couldn't noticing that most of the cast are British . You'll recognise most of their faces if not their names and you can't help but notice their absolutely atrocious American accents ! I really do hate it when American actors try ( And fail ) to do British accents and we've got a trans Atalantic role reversal here . Trying to tell me Jonathan Pryce couldn't have done better ? I won't waste any more words on this movie except to reiterate that it's a lazily written , badly acted and hugely disappointing film
469676	1532177	65184	4.0	Not Much Of A Tribute	Peter Ustinov died a few days ago and is traditional with stars dying the BBC showed a film as a hasty tribute , and what film did we get as a tribute ? SPARTACUS where Ustinov gives a show stopping performance as a slave trader ? Nope . Another Oscar performance this time from TOKAPI ? Nope . What about ASHANTI ? , it's a film a lot of critics can't stand but Ustinov's politically incorrect performance had me in stiches . No can do . The film we got was VIVA MAX a slap stick comedy that seems a bit of a slap in the face as far as tributes go Ustinov plays the title character of Max very well but to be honest VIVA MAX isn't much of a comedy . It might be politically incorrect but it's also very unsophisticated . The Mexicans decide to recapture the Alamo . Let's be honest , does that sound like there's going to be a lot of milage in this premise ? You're right there isn't so we're treated to scenes featuring silly Mexican soldiers fighting off silly American soldiers with fire hoses and exchanges of dialogue along the lines of " Drop your weapons - No you drop your weapons - No you drop your weapons - No you drop your weapons " and it's all done with the subtlety of THE BLUES BROTHERS another film where I didn't start laughing
468837	1532177	206314	4.0	Unoriginal And Dumb	A couple of brothers Lewis and Fuller decide to have a laugh with their CB radio and try to seduce a truck driver which leads to some very serious and violent trouble Sorry guys but I didn't think much of this movie . It's totally unoriginal and most of the fun derived from it is playing " Name that source " . I managed to spot DUEL , JEEPERS CREEPERS and THE HITCHER to name but three . I also managed to spot a few plot holes but let's not get into that , it's a dumb movie so enough said . There is one unappealing aspect to all this when you think about it and that is that Lewis and Fuller brought all this trouble on their own heads and because of this several innocent people die . Compare this with the three movies I mentioned above where the protagonists in peril are genuinely innocent people which means ROADKILL ( As it's known in Britain ) is morally bankrupt in comparison to other films in this sub genre
468507	1532177	100619	4.0	Bleak And Arty	SILENT SCREAM is a biopic about convicted murderer Larry Winters . However not content with making a standard prison film the director David Hayman throws a massive spanner in the works by making the movie an art house picture with fractured time lines . We know that Winters served in the army , that he murdered a bar man in cold blood and that he's serving a life sentence but that's all we really find out as the story keeps jumping around to different times and places . There's a vague notion that if you treat dangerous criminals with dignity they can be rehabilitated but this point isn't really hammered home , and unless you're aware of Scottish culture like the sectarian divide in the West of Scotland you'll find much of the film confusing . It's also a rather bleak film not helped by its obvious lack of budget and I can only recommend it if you're interested in seeing Brit film star Robert Carlyle and well known TV star Julie Graham in cameo roles
468498	1532177	92099	4.0	Perhaps The Most Typical Bruckheimer Production	You can just imagine Jerry Bruckheimer sitting at the studio offices in a totally disinterested mood as his colleagues discuss the pre planning stages of TOP GUN . Dismissing anything that vaguely resembles a good idea Jerry turns to them and says " Forget about complicated plots and great stories . Hire me a couple of hunky actors with great teeth and write me a couple of songs for the soundtrack " and his colleagues comply Personally speaking the above attitude seems kind of lousy if you want to make a good film but it's logical if you want to make a successful one . Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer , if the teenage girls don't rush out to the cinema to see either of these guys sure as hell every dentist in the country will , so right away you've got a ready made audience . Add to that lots of macho big boys toys ( In this case fighter jets ) which will appeal to a teenage male audience and you've got an even bigger ready made audience . Plus you can release a soundtrack which means more money and advertising for the movieYes indeed TOP GUN was a mega success at the cinema which proves Jerry Bruckheimer knows his stuff . However as many , many people have noted there's a big difference between a GOOD movie and a SUCCESSFUL movie and watching TOP GUN after almost 20 years after it came out it comes across as being shallow , thread bare and rather jingoistic . From the very first scene of fighter aircraft flying off the carrier to the closing credits director Tony Scott seems to be making something that's a cross between a recruiting film for the US Navy and a music video , there's romance for the girls , a few dog fight for the boys but much of it seems aimed for the next MTV slot . There's not a lot here that will challenge the mindI also couldn't noticing the flag waving either , in just about every scene a character proudly boasts that " The United States has the best fighter pilots in the world " . I'm not dissing anyone across the pond who's served their country but the undisputed kings of the sky are the Israeli airforce who manged to destroy 240 Egyptian fighters in one single day during the 1967 six day war . They also shot down 38 Syrian aircraft in dogfights , again in a single day , in June 1982 . The Israelis have no equals when it comes to fighter pilots . I can understand Hollywood getting all nationalistic since they had such a right wing president ( A former Hollywood actor no less ) at the time but the " God bless the United States - we're the best at everything we do " attitude does grate very quickly especially to non Americans and a later Bruckheimer production PEARL HARBOR drowned in its patriotic fervor with an American fighter pilot almost winning The Battle Of Britain single handed A lot of people flocked to the cinema when it was first released and a lot of people bought the soundtrack too , but as a film it is rather shallow , uninvolving and if you can't remember the 1980s then you might be ever so puzzled why this film made so much money . If truth be told I'm slightly puzzled myself and I suggest you go out of your way to watch AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN which is a very similar movie but a far better one For a film that strangely negates the skill of the Israeli airforce I couldn't help noticing that this movie was inspired by an article written by Ehud Yonay . I've not checked up on this guy's background but wouldn't Ehud Yonay be an Israeli name ?
469887	1532177	83284	4.0	Highly Unlikely Sports Drama	Perhaps the above summary isn't really a criticism since ESCAPE TO VICTORY isn't a film that is to be taken seriously . Well I hope it isn't because to have the then 48 year old Michael Caine to be playing a English international footballer who was world famous in the 30s must have meant he was at the height of his footballing skill when he was in his late thirties ! And we have Pele the greatest football player ever as the inmate of a prisoner of war camp during the second world war . Just one problem though , Pele is a black man ! Did the Germans ever take a single black man prisoner during the second world war ? Write in if anyone knows . Trivia note : The English football supporters have their own orchestra which constantly plays the theme tune to the classic Michael Caine caper movie THE ITALIAN JOB , not that this ever improves the team's performance .
469085	1532177	94638	4.0	Another Crap TVM	Another TVM that's a waste of time . The plot revolves around a ballsy police captain - And yes she's a woman - trying to weed out poor practice and corruption in her department . Apart from the usual twee faults of a TVM production there were several things that irritated me about this film . 1 ) Suzanne Pleshettes's performance . If you have the misfortune of seeing ALONE IN THE NEON JUNGLE check out the way Pleshette is unable to keep her head still . It really is distracting the way she shakes or nods her head while speaking . 2 ) Despite being set in 1988 everyone wears clothes from different eras . We see people ( Pimps I take it ) walking about dressed like John Travolta in SNF , punks even though they died out a few years before , and bikers who look like they're straight out of a early 70s road movie3 ) The hookers in this all wear tights ( Pantyhose I think they're called in America ) but I'm led to believe most hookers have sex with their clients in the back of their car so are tights a practical item of clothing for a streetwalking working girl ? And it just shows what poor entertainment this film is when I find myself asking an abstract question like thatOh and ALONE IN THE NEON JUNGLE also features one of the most incomprehensible lines I've ever heard . When trying to break a corrupt cop the heroine says " Do you know what they do to cops in prison ? They rape you by throwing you from the top tier " Can someone send me a private message telling me what the hell getting raped by being thrown from the top tier is ? Oh and despite cops getting blown away in Pittsburgh prostitution and burglary seem to be the only crimes the police department worry about
470220	1532177	71569	4.0	Probably Harryhausen's Least Impressive Effort	Ray Harryhausen is a special FX god who knocks todays CGI wizards into a corked hat . Compare the skeleton scenes of JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS with many of today's movies and tell me what effect is more convincing ? No contest is it ? Unfortunately the problem with THE GOLDEN VOYAGE OF SINBAD is that the audience is sitting there waiting for some great stop frame animation to come along and the film drags its feet in this respect . Twenty five minutes into the running time and there's only one small sequence featuring the Harryhausen effect , instead the audience have to put up with a bunch of not unknown British television actors standing around talking . The stop frame animation sequences do eventually come but how many children would have been bored senseless by this time ? Watching THE GOLDEN VOYAGE OF SINBAD today is of interest for only two reasons . One is that the heroes are obviously Muslim which you probably won't be seeing in too many movies these days while the other is that the producer of DOCTOR WHO at the time Barry Letts decided to cast Tom baker in the title role after seeing him in this movie
468406	1532177	94208	4.0	Plot less Love Story	For the life of me I have no idea what type of movie director Diane Kurys was trying to make here . It centres around the relationship between American director Steve Elliot and English actress Jane Steiner . It contains long - Too long - scenes of romantic European cities with romantic music in the background but at the same time is possibly too explicit to be a simple love story . For example Steve gets Jane to tell him an erotic lesbian fantasy " I can feel her lips on my nipples as I rub my hand between her legs . . . " and there's some nudity . But the problem with MAN IN LOVE is that there's zero plot . Okay I wasn't expecting car chases or Bruce Willis crashing through windows but the story ends up going nowhere . In many ways it's like a meaningless Mills & Boon story that might strike a cord with women who have just experienced a holiday romance . No doubt French film students will think this some sort of romantic masterwork but I didn't care for it apart from the lesbian fantasy monologue
469621	1532177	86625	4.0	Globus And Golan At Full Throttle	If you're not old enough to remember Yoram Globus and Menahem Golan here's the rundown : They're a couple of film producers and finaciers from Israel who set up the Cannon film company in the early 1980s . The only Israeli to get a worse press than these two was Menachim Begin . Begin probably deserved the bad press but Globus and Golan were a god send to film makers because no matter how bad your script was they'd happily fund your movie and would normally employ directors who couldn't direct and actors who couldn't act . In fact you often got the impression that people would just walk up to Yoram and Menahem ask them for some money and they'd oblige without seeing the film maker's resume . If only producers nowadays were so trusting . THE YOUNG WARRIORS isn't a Cannon film but Globus and Golan did finance it and it has their signature all over it . It's badly directed , badly acted , badly edited but it's the script that jumps out and attacks you with its awfulness . It starts with a bunch of high school jocks getting involved in all sorts of zany pranks , in fact the first 20 minutes of the movie plays out like a sex comedy and it's something of a shock when THE YOUNG WARRIORS turns into a vigilante movie . But it's not just any type of vigilante movie like EXTERMINATOR 2 or DEATH WISH 3 ( Notice a connection ? They're both sequels and they're both vigilante movies made by Cannon films ) , no siree this is a laughably bad vigilante movie about pretty boy high school jocks and their poodle going on a mission to wipe out scumbags . This film is proof that Globus and Golan were giving money to people regardless of their film making abilities and you have to worry about people who seem to spend their entire reserves on making movies set entirely around vigilantes
469275	1532177	105608	4.0	There's A Killer On The Loose	! ! ! ! ! SPOILERS ! ! ! ! ! Someone's going around bumping off cops and you really can't him since the cops . . . 1 ) Beat up suspects . Though to be fair they'll beat up anyone regardless of skin colour so at least they're not racist cops 2 ) Swear a lot 3 ) Spout terrible dialogue 4 ) Get drunk in bars and decide to drive home 5 ) Have sex in a room full of strobing light effects thereby giving voyeurs a seizureActually this was slightly better than I expected it was going to be . My only real complaint is when the murderer was revealed as the police captain who had killed the hero's father years earlier . I'm still still trying to work out what the motive for all this was . Perhaps I missed something due to a seizure ?
470340	1532177	66815	4.0	Rather Boring	One thing I have noticed about British horror movies from the 1970s is that they don't hold up to repeated viewing THEATRE OF BLOOD is a case in point as are all those Amicus anthology movies . Add THE BEAST IN THE CELLAR to the list Much of the drama of this movie revolves around the build up of a plot revelation at the end . Once you know what the revelation is this becomes a rather flat film . It does open with a fairly good hook but after that we're treated to long boring sequences of two old ladies making small talk . Correct me if I'm wrong but how many people watch a horror movie expecting a couple of old ladies making small talk ? The only sort of interest to be found in THE BEAST IN THE CELLAR is the anti-smoking stance . Some people have mentioned that this is an anti-war or anti-military film but watch carefully and you'll see that everytime a squaddie lights up for a fly puff he gets killed . Rather strange considering attitudes to smoking weren't nearly so hysterical as they are nowadays
469019	1532177	71118	4.0	Not As Good As The TV Show	This film version of James Herriot's series of novels isn't much cop compared to the television show of the same . This movie is the prior piece but there's nothing very memorable about . The plot is more or less composed of " Will young James get married to his girlfriend or not ? " , hardly the most original or compelling premise for a movie , and we're treated to little in the way of these blackly comical scenes of animals and their owners having mishaps that made the TV show enjoyable . Perhaps the worst problem is that Tristan ( Played by boyish mischief in the show by Peter Davison ) is more or less a peripheral character in this movieThe cast are passable ( Simon West was rather famous when this was produced while Anthony Hopkins was almost totally unknown ) but they seem to lack the flair that Christopher Timothy , Robert Hardy and Peter Davison brought to the long running series
469336	1532177	253200	4.0	Good Casts Don't Always = Good Movies	LAST ORDERS involves some of Britain's greatest actors playing characters who are taking the ashes of their late friend to be sprinkled off Margate Pier , their friend in question being played by British acting legend Michael Caine Impressed ? I wasn't because there's very little in the way of plot , with much of the story being told in flash back but don't expect anything resembling PULP FICTION or MEMENTO because this is just about as low concept as a movie can get , if you're able to get to the end credits without nodding off you have done very well . Perhaps your idea of extreme sports is watching paint dry ? The more I think about it the more I'm disappointed with it . Look we've got Michael Caine , Helen Mirren , Bob Hoskins and Ray Winstone in the same movie and little happens . Wouldn't have been much better if Hoskins and Mirren were getting bothered by the IRA trying to muscle into their patch so they hire Caine as an assassin who gets jailed for throwing a man off a tower block and he has to pay protection money to Winstone who rules the prison wing . That would have been a great British movie
468627	1532177	82250	4.0	Pointless	! ! ! ! SPOILERS ! ! ! ! The original DEATH WISH was fairly good but soon found itself surpassed in intellect by TAXI DRIVER and entertainment value by THE EXTERMINATOR so it seems somewhat pointless making a sequel to the groundbreaking vigilante drama . The problem with the sequel is that it asks us to suspend our disbelief enough to imagine that Paul Kersey's daughter is gang raped a second time and then brutally murdered . You really have to wonder if anyone is that unlucky , but it gets even dumber , according to this script if you rent a seedy hotel room in a sleazy part of LA you'll have no problem bumping into the scum who raped and murdered your daughter . Must be a very small town ? And apparently if the cops seal off a street a vigilante can still easily turn up at a criminals doorstep to execute him and manage to escape if he fails to do so . I could go on about the ridiculous plot holes but I won't bother . DEATH WISH 3 had even more plot holes but at least it was great entertainment unlike number two in the series . The only entertainment to be had is watching Laurence Fishburne ( Yes that one ) body popping while wearing pink sunglasses
468694	1532177	429487	4.0	What's Going On ?	I firmly believe that the best Oscar ceremony in recent years was in 2003 for two reasons : 1 ) Host Steve Martin was at his most wittiest : " I saw the teamsters help Michael Moore into the trunk of his limo " and " I'll better not mention the gay mafia in case I wake up with a poodle's head in my bed " 2 ) Surprise winners : No one had Adrien Brody down for best actor ( Genuine applause ) or Roman Polanski for best director ( Genuine jeers and boos ) but they won Last year's award ceremony wasn't too bad but there was little in the way of surprises and I was happy to see RETURN OF THE KING sweep the awards even if it wasn't the best in the trilogy ( FELLOWSHIP was much better ) but what let the BBC coverage down was Jonathan Ross getting a few of his sycophantic mates round and pretending they were hilarious when they were anything but . So when I heard Sky were doing the coverage for British TV I was expecting Barry Norman and Mark Kermode to be doing the links , but instead we ended up with Jamie Theakston and Sharon Osbourne ! Oh gawd if British TV are desperate for film critics ( Obviously they are ) I'm sure both Bob The Moo and Theo Robertson will happily fly over to LA to give their honest opinions on the winners and losers Chris Rock wasn't too bad , but he's no Steve Martin while the location seemed to resemble a sports hall with seats put in ! Not much of a glitzy arena in my opinion . The main problem I had with the ceremony was the format with the " minor " Oscars handed out to the winners who were sitting in their seats ! There's no such thing as a " minor " Oscar and just because the award is for Best Animated Short or Best Costume Design they're as well deserved as Best Picture or Best Director . All the winners should be allowed to march up to the podium . What a bunch of arrogant snobs the Academy are becoming and I quite agree with the comments that this format is disgraceful and if it wasn't for the surprises this could possibly have been the worst ceremony in history . As for the awards themselves Best Supporting Actress - Cate Blanchett . No great surprise for a competitive category Best Supporting Actor - Morgan Freeman . No real complaints since Freeman is one of America's greatest living character actors Best Actor - Jamie Foxx . Most predictable award of the night . Yawn Best Actress - Hilary Swank . Major surprise since everyone thought Annette Benning was going to win simply down to academy politics but Swank did deserve it and gave the best speech of the night Best Director - Clint Eastwood . Major surprise since everyone thought Scorsese was going to get the award simply because he'd never won one . Actually I'm glad about this because if he didn't deserve it for TAXI DRIVER , RAGING BULL or GOODFELLAS he didn't deserve it for THE AVIATOR Best Film - MILLION DOLLAR BABY . Again another major surprise since everyone thought the academy would split the awards for best director and best picture while I thought the Hollywood friendly plot of THE AVIATOR would have made it a dead cert for Best Picture while MDB's controversial subject matter would have turned a lot of voters off What these awards perhaps illustrate is that this year the voters have decided to ignore Oscar politics and genuinely give out awards to people who deserve it something they haven't done in the past , I mean A BEAUTIFUL MIND beating THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING for gawd's sake ! And long may the academy vote with their heads instead of their hearts
469295	1532177	279750	4.0	" I'll Give You Anything You Want " . . .	. . . Is the opening line of this movie with the reply being " Do we look like criminals ? " , but I wish the reply had been " A bigger budget please " because OUTTA TIME would certainly have benefited from it . The story while being no great shakes is engaging enough with twists and turns holding the interest but it's impossible not to notice the cheap sets , the mediocre cast and the very shaky ( I mean that in its literal sense ) directing that you'd expect to find in a straight to video movie
469160	1532177	116508	4.0	Is This A Drinks Commercial ?	Dave who is a former cop and former drunk takes his wife on a fishing trip and sees a plane crash and rescues a young girl from a watery grave which sets up the plot Did I mention Dave is a a former cop and former drunk ? Good because this might be important apart from Dave being a former drunk . In fact the director and the screenwriter thinks it's so important that Dave used to have a drink problem they drown the audience with a subtext involving alcohol . Umpteen scenes take place in bars even when it's not all that necessary to the plot while nearly every scene not featuring a bar involves characters drinking or referring to alcohol and all the scenes look like they're shot ala booze commercial . Bar scenes look like beer commercials , office scenes look like bourbon commercials and scenes shot on boats off the coast look like rum commercials . I don't know if I'm reading too much into this but since the message that Dave is a former alcoholic is hammered home it drew this reviewer's attention to the number of scenes featuring drink The problem with HEAVEN'S PRISONERS is not only the amount of scenes that seemingly promote drink it's the number of scenes in general . This is a screenplay that needed streamlined in the first draft since nothing much really happens in the first place and when they do they don't really progress the plot very much . Of course it's a character driven story but it's also film noir in nature and the film noir genre isn't known for it's character development so when a character is introduced we know who they are and there's no need to go over the same ground to explain who they are . This is a movie that last for well over two hours when in fact chopping off a good 45 minutes would have been a very good thing . No doubt Baldwin , Roberts and Hatcher had high hopes with this movie improving their careers but it's a damp squib for all involved
468571	1532177	35244	5.0	I wasn't Blown Away	When you mention the name Cecil B . DeMille you realise right away you're not going to watching social realism you're going to be watching action , adventure and above all spectacle , and REAP THE WILD WIND gets off to everything you're expecting , a shipwreck in glorious technicolor . Okay there's an anachronism or two with a rescue ship being commanded by a fine Southern lady , but this is Hollywood and Cecil B Demille can do whatever he wants . Unfortunately after this very bright start it becomes more and more obvious that Demille isn't doing very much since much of the ( in ) action is taking place in a house . Where's this giant squid I heard about ? When you mention the name John Wayne you realise right away you're not going to be watching some pansy ass debating society you're going to be watching action , adventure and fists flying , this is Hollywood and The Duke can punch whoever he likes . Unfortunately it becomes obvious that this was made early in Wayne's career and his character isn't the main focus of the story . This isn't too bad since I've never liked John Wayne's one dimensional performances but again no matter who the star of the movie is there's far too much talk and not enough action . Where's this giant squid I heard about ?
468524	1532177	241114	5.0	Doesn't Go Far Enough	You want to know about rabies ? Try this : One time I was abroad and was unfortunate to be bitten by a stray cat . I didn't think too much of it at the time . I traveled back to the capital city to catch my plane back to Britain and I got into a conversation with the night porter at my hostel who had spent his national service as a medic and for some strange reason the conversation got round to rabies . " We don't have much of that here in cities , but there's a lot of it in the north of the country . Very terrible death , I'd much rather die of AIDS or cancer " he told me . Considering I'd just returned from the north of the country I felt the first pangs of worry . The porter then went into detail of footage he'd seen while in the medical corps " You can see in the victim's eyes that they're aware of what's going on despite their delusions . . . the throat contracts in spasms and that's what kills them , they effectively suffocate . Very nasty death " By now I was having a panic attack and didn't actually care if I got blown up by a terrorist bomb on my way back to the airport Before I left the next day I popped into a cybercafe and looked up cases of rabies in the region . What I saw terrified me since the disease isn't exactly unknown where I was , several people had died there in the late 1990s . I then looked up symptoms of rabies on the internet and the night porter wasn't kidding , it's almost certainly the most terrible death known to mankind , it kills 40-50 , 000 people a year and worst of all even if you're receiving inoculations against the disease if you develop symptoms that's it - You're almost certainly going to suffer a lingering painful death . Few and far between are survivors of rabies and those who do survive are left with terrible brain damage making them little more than vegetablesAs soon as I arrived back to in Britain I felt slightly dizzy and had a sore throat . I might have been the first symptoms of rabies or more likely it might have been the cold virus . I popped into my local health centre where I had an appointment with my doctor " Any foaming at the mouth ? If you'd been exposed to rabies you'd have contracted it by now " which is incorrect since it can take as much as several years for symptoms to develop though the average incubation is two to three months , I'd been bitten a couple of weeks earlier . The doctor ( Who seemed much better at asking questions rather than answering them ) managed to contact a hospital in Glasgow where I went the next day . I love hospitals . Having all those young nurses fussing over you , so normally if a young , tall , slim , blond nurse took my blood pressure I'd be in flirting heaven but not this time . I let the nurse carry out the tests without any wise cracks . I was then seen by the doctor , she was in her early twenties , brunette , perhaps the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen , I vaguely noticed she was bra less and it was a very cold December day . No cheeky comments , no flirting and most of all no false machismo to impress this definitive vision of beauty . To give you an impression of how serious I was after I'd had the first course of vaccinations , I thanked her and said " I hope to never see you again " and I meant it . The hospital sent the vaccine to my local hospital where I was successfully inoculated against the virus over a course of a month . I'm alive but for several weeks I couldn't even begin to describe the fear I felt . I couldn't even hear the word " Rabies " without breaking into a cold sweat . It was perhaps the most frightening experience of my life That's the problem with THE MAD DEATH - It doesn't go far enough . I do remember the title sequence but alas I also remember a few unintentional funny scenes . A woman smuggles in her pet from the continent and it ends up on the menu for a fox which then attacks the star of UFO . If I remember correctly the most " shocking " scene involves Basil Brush being covered in shaving foam being slammed against Commander Stryker's car windscreen . Oh and Commander Stryker's been a naughty boy since he's been having an affair with his secetary and has given the rabies virus to her : Cut to Ms Secetary lying on a hospital bed dying of rabies . It looked like she was faking an orgasm while vomiting toothpaste ! You do get the impression that no one on the production has seen a rabies victim die . There's other images that stick out in the mind like the army going on a cull or the final ambiguous scene that implies it's all going to happen again but comes across as being cheesy . If you really want to know about this terrible killer disease , go abroad and get bitten by a stray mammal then type in " Symptoms of rabies " in any search engine . Make sure you have plenty of toilet paper ready because you'll certainly need it
469894	1532177	83232	5.0	Too Slow For Some Tastes . . . .	. . . . Including mine I stayed up late to watch TRUE CONFESSIONS down to the simple reason it contained performances by De Niro and Duvall . Neither performance disappointed ( Remember this was made in 1981 when DeNiro was a God when it came to acting . How times change ) but the rest of the film did . I was under the impression that this was going to be very similar to LA CONFIDENTIAL and for brief spots the movie hints it's heading in that direction with its subplot of the murder of a prostitute and pornography but there's far too many slow talky scenes with static direction and there seems to be a subtext of catholic guilt in there somewhere which will probably confuse anyone who didn't attend a catholic school as a child . If you want to see DeNiro in a great film about redemption and guilt watch ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA instead
469707	1532177	330929	5.0	What's It About ?	This centres around a sectary working at a firm called Funtime Inc but that's about all I can tell you because the narrative didn't make much sense to me and it's as if director Miranda Bowen is trying to film a shampoo advert ! The phone rings , the sectary picks up the phone then we get surreal scenes where the sectary is in a tropical rain forest surrounded by exotic animals where she's at one with nature I notice the other comments are similar to mine . I think the problem with making short films is that it's perceived as a director's medium . Like a feature length movie a short must have a decent script in order for it to work and that's the problem with STAGNATE - The audience are not drawn into the story
469871	1532177	82085	5.0	Spoiled By My Over Familarity Of The Director's Work	I'm rather sad at having to give BLOW OUT . I'm sure that if I'd seen this many years ago my vote would have been much higher . The problem with watching in 2005 is that I've become too over familiar with the work of Brian De Palma , I'm sorry to say this but he's a film maker lacking in much variety and BLOW OUT features all of the director's trade marks : The steady cam as it films the murderers point of view , the slow mo sequence as the killer descends on his prey , garish colours , hell we even have John Lithgow as a murderer and Dennis Franz as a cop . How many times has that happened in a De Palma movie ? Not to be too negative this is BLOW UP done in a Alfred Hitchcock manner . While De Palma tries to emulate the master of of suspense a bit too much he does make a far more involving movie than the tedious and pretentious Anglo Italian movie from the 1960s . It's okay as a thriller , it's just that it feels like most of Brian De Palma's other movies
469349	1532177	44121	5.0	One Serious Production Flaw	THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD is credited as being the very first cold war analogy science fiction movie . This is summed up by Scotty's radio broadcast at the end of the movie where he states that a handful of brave Americans have saved the day and to " Watch the skies " . What he really means that only Americans should be trusted to save the world and to watch out for communist infiltrators . Hardly one of screendom's most subtle messages With such an obvious subtext about fighting communism the producers have gone and shot themselves in the foot by missing out on such an obvious aspect of John W Campbell's source novel WHO GOES THERE ? and it's this : The alien creature is a shape shifting monster and can take the form of human beings . Worked it out ? The alien could resemble friends , family members and work colleagues just like communist agents would resemble friends , family members and work colleagues . For a movie that is trying to warn us about the red menace I am somewhat shocked that the producers didn't work this element into the screenplay at the very first draft . As many people have mentioned on these pages THE THING hasn't dated well , but my dad saw it when it was originally released in the cinema all those years ago and he didn't think much of it then , so I doubt if the passing of time has much to do with it not being all that regarded in the 21st century . It should be pointed out that a story featuring a plot of a monster walking about killing people wasn't all that original in 1951 anyway since Universial Studios had been making this type of movie almost 20 years earlier via FRANKENSTIEN , THE WOLF MAN etc and in those movies the audience did feel empathy for the monster unlike here . Though I guess if the monster is a filthy commie we're not supposed to empathise with itDespite some reservations ( The massive plot holes for example ) I do prefer the John Carpenter remake which stays closer to the original novel , a novel that ironically doesn't have a political subtext despite the shape shifting elements
470195	1532177	99253	5.0	Rather Mediocre Sequel	Did someone say Universal Studios bought the rights to CHILD'S PLAY from MGM ? If so I'd say it was MGM who showed business savvy . The original - which I haven't seen in years - does contain instinctively fond memories but I'm not sure to give much credence to my memories . I should also point out there's a very 80s seen it all before feel to this sequel . Wise cracking monsters that murder and mutilate humans ? We saw that in the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET and HELLRAISER franchises . Was anyone expecting this type of horror to last well in to the 21st Century ? neither did I . Pity Universal Studios didn't give me a job because I could have stopped them losing money There's also another aspect that's wrong and that's the audience identification . The story revolves around possessed doll Chucky trying to track down a young boy called Andy . Hmmm a horror film where the audience are supposed to relate to a child ! Fair enough if it was a children's movie but it's not so couldn't the producers come up with the protagonist being a more mature character ? To be fair they do have a teenage girl as the heroine but she's not technically the main character . Couldn't Andy have been dropped altogether in the draft stage and have Kyle as the protagonist ? There's also a feel that there's a fair bit of slumming from the cast . I've no idea why Brad Dourif didn't become a big name after ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST and show's you how far he fell when he's probably best remembered as being the voice of Chucky instead of his roles in NEST and THE TWO TOWERS . Jenny Agutter is a surprise casting choice being a well known name and the fact that her character's death receives no build up or impact aesthetic tell's you all you need to know as to how ill thought out this mediocre sequel is
469715	1532177	103128	5.0	Far Better Than I Expected	Lenny Henry is a comedian I have a lot of time for , everytime I see him on the telly I say to myself " Time for a bath " or " Time to mow the lawn " or " Time to go to bed " In short he's one of the most unfunny men ever to have his own BBC show so I was expecting TRUE IDENTITY to be a major road accident involving a star vehicle . I was nicely surprisedDid someone say this was originally written for Eddie Murphy ? I must say that as Miles Pope Henry is actually an improvement over Murphy . Can't you just imagine Murphy going way , way over the top in the role with the words " Motherfer " appearing in every second sentence . Instead Henry makes Pope a likable affable loser who is very easy to like and boy does he make a very convincing white man . I bet Michael Jackson is asking the make-up team on this movie how it's done Much of the credit of the film's enjoyment for me is simply down to the script . It's beatifully paced and contains a lot of scenes that had me gasping " How is Miles going to talk himself out of this situation ? " . If I have a complaint it's that we don't see enough of Miles as a white mafia hitman All in all a very entertaining comedy thriller , it's not a classic and maybe my praise is down to the fact I was expecting to give TRUE IDENTITY but it did keep my attention and gets
470140	1532177	56568	6.0	Rather Dated And Melodramatic In Places	What's the problem film critics have with Laurence Olivier ? One of the greatest actors who has ever lived has the reputation as one of the worst film actors of all time ! Okay I don't think playing Jews ( As in THE JAZZ SINGER and BOYS FROM BRAZIL ) was his forte but look at his performances in WUTHERING HEIGHTS and SPARTACUS . These are towering performances without a whiff of ham and if we're talking understated under-rated performances take a look at TERM OF TRIAL SPOILER Olivier plays Graham Weir an alcoholic school teacher who spent the war as a " conchie " and who is taken to court for indecently assaulting one of his female pupils . Olivier plays the role very well but unfortunately this is hardly a great film . Most the problems are down to Peter Glenville's script . For example two male pupils Mitchell and Thompson are written as though they're going to be major characters throughout the movie but disappear totally from the plot in the last third , and there's a problem with Weir's appearance in court at the end , he strangely never takes the witness stand which means it's after he is found guilty that he makes an impassioned speech which causes the victim to tell the truth . Logically Weir should have made the speech as he was being cross examined in the witness boxA fairly good performance by Olivier in a rather melodramatic British film from 1962 . It should also be pointed out DR NO was also released that year which led to the death of the British Kitchen sink drama , but by this time the sub genre was probably past its sell by date anyway
469437	1532177	186566	6.0	Entertaining Enough But Reminded Me Of Something Else	SPACE COWBOYS is a movie whose plot goes like this : An object is tumbling to Earth which means a rescue mission staffed by unlikely astronauts must go up in a space shuttle to save countless lives . " Where have I heard that plot before ? " you ask yourself . try a couple of years in the past where a bunch of oil riggers led by Bruce Willis went up in a space shuttle to destroy an asteroid hurtling towards Earth . Same plot more or less and you'll be able to shout what the scientific mistakes are too . They're so obvious you can't miss them Thankfully SPACE COWBOYS isn't as shallow or trite as Armageddon but I'm certain no movie could be . This effort from director Eastwood does manage to stand on its own hind legs though . You can believe that when they were younger Frank ( Eastwood ) Hawke ( Jones ) Jerry ( Sutherland ) and Tank ( Garner ) did go into space which far more credible than anything you saw in Armageddon and the cast of this movie are genuinely able to make the audience like their characters - Hands up who thought the asteroid in Armageddon might actually be the good guy if not the best cast member ? By no means a classic SPACE COWBOYS is an old fashioned movie , perhaps a little too old fashioned since it's slightly predictable but is also old fashioned in a good way since it's a movie that is entirely carried by the veteran cast rather than the special effects or outlandish set pieces . In that case it's maybe incomparable to Armageddon after all
468593	1532177	66258	6.0	Bond Wannabe	Wow Paul Sherman is one badass secret agent . Look what he does to that man in the hotel bedroom , he's someone who takes no prisoners and makes James Bond look like a total wimp . But that's the problem with PUPPET ON A CHAIN , Sven Bertil Taube is no Sean Connery and lacks the presence needed to convincingly play a ruthless secret agent . I also found it strange that if the story is set in Holland that nearly everyone speaks with either an American or British accent except for Paul Sherman who's supposed to be American but has a noticable European accent . Still this is a fairly good , though slightly dumb thriller which does feature go go dancers . How many Bond films can claim that ?
469509	1532177	56592	6.0	Has Dated Poorly	It wasn't until last night that I actually got round to watching TO KILL A MOCKING BIRD . It's something of a legend and is reflected that it's in the IMDb top 250 movies at position 46 but i'm somewhat baffled as to why . Grogory Peck isn't bad but his performance as attorney Atticus Finch is disappointingly one note . He won the best actor Oscar for his role here but it's not a performance that shows that Peck has much range and other actors have failed to win Oscars for better performances through the years . The story itself is inoffensive but very predictable in that you know fine well that the man in the dock is a victim of racism rather than a murderer I truly believe that the only things this film has in its favour is that the child actors are bearable , but so were the children in Charles Laughton's NIGHT OF THE HUNTER , which despite being a masterpiece , did not come close to achieving the commercial and critical acclaim that this film did . We also have the novelty of seeing an unknown actor called Robert Duvall with hair but IMHO it's far from being a classic film . Please don't lynch me because I didn't like it
469159	1532177	87469	6.0	Sequelitis	If THE TEMPLE OF DOOM suffers from anything then it suffers from a condition called " Sequelitis " . It's a condition that is in no way serious but does show that in order to infect the host ( Aka the cinema audience ) the carrier ( Aka Mr Hollywood producer ) gets into a stupor of not doing anything , instead the carrier takes all the best ideas of an earlier movie and gives the host more of the same . In effect we have a movie that does not dare be different and why should it if the previous clone made the carrier a fortune at the box office . And to be fair THE TEMPLE OF DOOM is exciting and funny in parts . The problem is if you didn't like RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK you won't love this movieI've always thought Spielberg was overrated and when this movie was released he was regarded in some quarters as the greatest director of all time - A laughable assumption . The film contains some impressive set pieces but they would have been more impressive if the director had bothered to do a bit of trimming like the cart chase which goes on for too long . This especially becomes obvious when we're treated ( Though I doubt if " treated " is the correct word ) of a close up of Kate Capshaw screaming into the camera . This over the top humour reminded me of Spielberg's 1941 which is a very good example of spectacular humour not working . I should also point out that with the exception of JAWS I have always found John Williams to b a very average composer , and if some people consider this 1984 offering to be by " the greatest director of all time " then why was I unimpressed by the cinematography ? It should also be mentioned that if you were upset by the amount of violence in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK you'll also be upset by the amount of violence here but that's to be expected since this movie suffers from sequelitis
469539	1532177	260666	6.0	I Demand A Recount	TV Viewers in Britain were invited to phone the channel 4 studios and vote on what they thought was the worst moment in the history of television . The countdown was as much as you'd expect , former Northern Ireland minister Dr Mo Mowlam fettering about with a sex aid on SO GRAHAM NORTON , those pesky middle class kids from WHY DON'T YOU , those very badly dubbed shows that used to appear on Saturday morning BBC childrens television in the 1970s and of course the recasting of different actors on soap operas . But according to voters the worst moment in the history of television was Richard Madeley doing an impression of Ali G on THIS MORNING ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Aww come on guys I know you could fill this type of show with Richard Madeley clips - And he also came in fourth position with an interview with Shakin ' Stevens - but to say that this is the worst thing you've ever seen is going too farIt might seem ironic considering the subject matter but I was very irritated by the presence of Kate Thornton in many of the interviews . Ms Thornton couldn't have been much older than 25 when this show was broadcast and was perplexed about her opinions of 321 considering it was first broadcast in the mid 70s when Ms Thornton was born and finished about 10 years later when she wouldn't have even been a teenager
468976	1532177	70123	6.0	Somewhat Dated But Still Amusing	I had given up on ever seeing an episode of THE GOODIES ever being broadcast on British network TV . Apparently much of their humour would today be classed " racist " and I have seen clips where the cast use variations of the N word which would no longer be allowed on British television nowadays so it was something of a shock to see Channel 5 broadcast THE GOODIES AND THE BEANSTALK at Christmas I was looking forward to watching this again and could recall seeing it as a child . To be honest though much of the humour has somewhat dated with a fairly long early sequence similar to THE BENNY HILL SHOW where there's no dialogue , only a muzak soundtrack as the eponymous goodies try and make some money after falling on hard times . As with all the goodies sketches there's a policeman involved and a scene that will have the PC brigade falling out of their chairs since it might be classed as " homophobic " . There's a sequence later featuring a competition involving puppies " And remember if no one wins the puppies they'll be sold to Indian restaurants " and a sequence featuring a savage done up as Man Friday , but nothing that will cause great offence to someonewith a sense of humour . The only criticism I have about the humour of THE GOODIES AND THE BEANSTALK is that it's maybe a little too cartoonish and surreal for a modern day audience who think THE OFFICE and FRIENDS is the be all and end all of comedy . The goodies might have have been unsophisticated but they still remain amusingThere is one other thing I noticed while watching this that might be classed as criticism and that's the laughter track - It's too intrusive . People complain about the canned laughter in things like I'M ALAN PARTRIDGE , LITTLE Britain but it's just as bad here which goes to show it's not a modern phenomena
469515	1532177	53168	6.0	Difficult To Understand The High Rating	Robert Bresson's PICKPOCKET has an average rating higher than some of the movies in the top 250 movies on this site but I'm somewhat dismayed as to why it's so highly regarded . I suppose if you're a fan of Bresson and you want to see him do a movie in the new wave sense then you'll probably enjoy it but if you're unaware of new wave cinema and have people heaping superlatives upon it you'll probably be as disappointed as me The story itself is relatively threadbare , there's little plot and is mainly character driven . The story centres around Michel a recently released thief who returns to his old ways as a pickpocket . He meets up with a couple of other fingersmiths and there's a bit of romance involved and that's basically it plot wise . I wasn't convinced by the pickpocket choreography either , especially in one scene where Michel robs a bloke on a bus . I doubt if anyone could have failed to notice the way Michel acts so suspiciously . Honestly if this guy came to stand beside you on a crowded bus you'd instantly be worried about becoming a victim of an indecent assault ! I do realise that French new wave cinema has a massive amount of fans and its legacy leaked into the new Hollywood of the 1970s . You can tell Paul Schrader was heavily influenced by PICKPOCKET and one of his own screenplay's mirrors the ending here . Apart from that however you're probably better waiting for it to turn up on television than spending six quid to watch it in the cinema
469977	1532177	47577	6.0	I Used To Like This Movie	I first saw THIS ISLAND EARTH in the mid 1970s when I was about 10 years old and could remember liking it very much much as a colourful epic adventure complete with mutant monsters but after seeing it again tonight I was severly disappointed SPOILERS The problem mainly lies with a totally illogical plot . Scientists ( Including a woman - What female scientists existed in the 1950s ? ) from all over the world are given a test by aliens from another planet who then gather the scientists at a hidden retreat ( Don't ask why a superior race would need the help from humans ) , later the aliens wipe out most of these humans except for the hero and heroine who they take to their planet in a flying saucer ( I did say the plot was illogical ) where it's revealed the aliens need urainuim for their defensive shield ( You do think the aliens might have considered opening an urainium mine on Earth instead of kidnapping scientists but this is a totally illogical plot ) , the good alien helps the hero and heroine back to Earth killing a couple of mutants ( Pronounced " Mu - TANTS ) along the way . The hero and heroine escape the saucer which becomes a blazing tomb for the good alien and that's the plot of the movie , a totally illogical one There are some good points . The special effects like the saucer flying through the galaxy and the firestorm on Meta-Luna are adequate though in some places the lightning bolts striking the fleeing car are poor , and the mutants ( Though there's supposed to be several it's obvious only one costume was built ) are fun despite their short screen time , and I guess if you're a sucker for this type of pulp B movie you'll still enjoy it . I know I did but not as much as I did first time I saw it
469428	1532177	95956	6.0	Better Than The Second But Very Uneven	Believe me RAMBO FIRST BLOOD PART 2 took some swallowing but the opening ten minutes of RAMBO 3 caused me to fall out of my chair in shock . John Rambo does prize fighting to earn his keep in a Buddhist commune ! I mean that's a bit like having a film where the hero's an environmentalist who goes around blowing oil rigs to save the Alaskan wilderness . Oh wait a minute didn't Steven Seagal . . . . Despite this incredible and vain attempt at character development there follows much dialogue that accurately reflects what is going on in Afghanistan in the mid 1980s . The Soviet - Afghan war actually intensified when Mikhail Gorbachev came to power and by that time over one million Afghans had died in the conflict while as many as five million had been forced over the border into Iran and Pakistan as what analysts at the time called " Migratory genocide " , a euphemism that people nowadays would describe as " Ethnic cleansing " . There's other parts of the film that points out that screenwriter Sheldon Lettich has done his homework on the conflict with factual things like Soviet conscripts defecting to the Mujahedeen , of the red army planting mines and booby traps disguised as toys to blow off the limbs of children and of the Soviets use of chemical weapons which almost certainly proves that the sloppy script of FIRST BLOOD PART 2 was mainly down to James Cameron than Stallone , but as you'd expect in this type of action adventure movie the script rapidly degenerates into a series of set pieces of an all American superman blowing up a bunch of nasty commies who can't shoot straight . Ah well at least the main commie isn't played by a British actor unlike in the last film . Oh and congratulations to Peter McDonald for at least trying to make a Puma helicopter look like a Soviet helicopter gunship . The previous director was under the impression that the Soviets and Viet Cong use American Hueys Setting the record straight : A lot of people prove how ignorant they are of the Soviet - Afghan war by confusing the Mujahedeen with the Taliban . The Mujahedeen ( Translated " The soldiers of God " ) and the Taliban ( Translated " The students of God " ) are entirely seperate things . The Taliban were created in Pakistan in the early 1990s , took over Afghanistan in 1995 and were led by Mullah Omar . The Mujahedeen were split into several different groups and were led by different leaders ( None of them called Bin Laden ) most of them forming a coalition against the Taliban called the Northern Alliance in . Their overall leader was the legendary guerilla leader Ahmad Shah Massoud who was murdered in a suicide bombing by Al Qai'da terrorists in September 2001 . It was the Northern Alliance who fought side by side with the Western coalition during their campaign to overthrow the Taliban government in 2001 to the present day
468558	1532177	78474	6.0	Entertaining Despite The Flaws	! ! ! ! ! MILD SPOILERS ! ! ! ! ! In my review of AT THE EARTH'S core I said that the best of these Doug McClure gets attacked by rubber monsters in a 1970s British movie was THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT . If this holds true - And it's been years since I saw that movie - then WARLORDS OF ATLANTIS is certainly the second best in the genre Written by former DOCTOR WHO script writer Brian Hayles the story has some imagination even though no one is going to confuse it with a documentary . An eclectic ship's crew is abducted by a giant octopus and taken to the ancient city of Atlantis which is ruled by an alien civilisation which is engaged in a war of attrition against giant rubber monsters . One of the abductees Professor Aitken is wanted by the aliens for his superior intellect while the others will be used as slaves . It also turns out the abductees must be converted into gill breathers within a few days if they are to survive their new environment . Naturally upon hearing this the ships crew don't want to stay in their new home An entertaining enough story and unlike AT THE EARTHS CORE the production values are fairly good since location filming involving oceans and caves are used . There is the old bug bear of actors standing in front of obvious back projection trying to look scared at a rubber glove pocket but that's not enough to ruin the movie , in fact that adds some charm and the script has the temerity to point out that mankind's greatest achievements have come out of fighting one another in terrible wars . There are one or two plot holes like why do the aliens consider Professor Aitken a man of superior intellect since he would have no understanding of space travel or Einstiens theory of relativity , in other words he's a cave man compared to the aliens . You also can't help but notice that when the characters escape Atlantis Delphine the female lead has been rather superfluous to the plot But these minor flaws are never enough to totally ruin the movie for a discerning audience and I have noticed how many comments on this page centre around " I saw this when I was a kid and I'd love to see it again so please bring it out on DVD " It's probably nowhere as good as you remember it from 20 years ago but it still remains a fairly entertaining movie
469527	1532177	265349	6.0	Not Bad	I remember when this film was first released there was a lot of marketing hype about how this was " based on a true story " , but what wasn't pointed out was how this " true story " took place in the 1960s and for some inexplicable reason the producers updated it to the year 2000 or there abouts to the detriment of the story . It may have been difficult enough to believe THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES was a " true story " if it had remained set in the 60s but by placing it at the turn of the millenuim it's impossible to take seriously . For example after an incident a character is seen calling 911 on a mobile phone something that couldn't have possibly happened in the 1960s . It's a bit like SCINDLER'S LIST when you know a scene couldn't have happened like that and find yourself questioning how much else has been inventedDespite this serious criticism I did like THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES . Okay so I didn't believe this was a true story but there's still much to admire . Director Mark Pellington brings a bleak atmosphere to the movie and there's a couple of scenes that made me jump out of my seat . The cast are fairly good but Gere is inconsistent . Let's face it , he's a movie star because of his looks not because he has an abundance of thespian talent , but I'll give him credit for his performance opposite Debra Messing at the start of the film which both poignant and moving . So a thumbs up from me because it's a haunting supernatural drama , even though I take the true story with a big pinch of salt
468485	1532177	60214	6.0	Entertaining Without Being A Classic Comedy Horror	I had often thought this was the best movie in the CARRY ON series , an opinion brought about by the fact that there's a couple of DOCTOR WHO references and that it combines the genres of comedy and horror . After seeing it recently I would say that both CARRY ON CLEO and CARRY ON UP THE KYHBER are better movies But CARRY ON SCREAMING still remains one of the better films in the series even if ( Or because ) it's off centre with its peers : the main character is played by an actor who's not a regular member of the cast , there's references to other popular TV shows of the time like Z-CARS and STEPTOE AND SON , and there's little of the cringe making innuendo seen in the later movies . There are some flaws that may rile fans of the post modernist SCREAM movies like no one noticing monsters stalking the woods or a lack of internal continuity where monsters being able to knock down doors then not being able to when the script requires it but CARRY ON SCREAMING remains a fairly entertaining movie almost 40 years after it was made
470169	1532177	74853	6.0	Musical Dictator	There seems to be an inferiority complex about this version of THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK but why ? Mike Newall is a competent director and he's assembled a fine cast in something that doesn't resemble a made for television movie . The story itself is based upon a Dumas swashbuckling classic but there's a fly in the ointment that is an obvious giveaway that this version lacks confidence . What am I talking about ? Why the music of course . Whenever the film wants us to feel something Allyn Ferguson's score dictates how the audience should be feeling . Certainly the score for THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK goes with the visuals but did it need to be so obvious ? It's almost like listening to PETER AND THE WOLF where the music itself is the narrative and I'm not sure if that's a good thing in cinema
470281	1532177	71566	6.0	Cliched	GOLD centres around a shadey conspiracy involving a South African gold mine . Since it's set in South Africa you can expect all the nausating cliches and stereotypes like the sadistic white racist who likes to beat up the " Feelthy blecks " , the noble black , the macho but anti racist white man etc . In fact much of the stereotypes are slightly offensive like " Big " King and his men who enjoy putting on a Zulu dance for the tourists . It wouldn't be so bad if they kept to the Zulu diet of their ancestors but these " Zulus " seem to have been overdoing it on the beer and pizza a little bit and I doubt if Stanley Baker and Michael Caine would have had much trouble beating them . Luckily none of the secret illuminati are called Goldberg or Goldstien because that would have been racist , so the director has made these shadowey figures either English , Americans and Germans , the only exception being an Arab . But don't worry about accusations of anti semetism because there's a character called Hirschfeld . I don't know if that's a Jewish name but he's portrayed as you'd expect a Jewish stereotype to be shown : Loud , vulgar , money orientated and is always smoking a big fat cigar . SLIGHT SPOILERS Despite all the racist stereotypes and cliches ( Or because of them ? ) I did find GOLD a fairly entertaining thriller . If I've a problem with the film it's that it tries to be too many things at once . In some ways it's not so much a conspiracy thriller but a disaster movie , but it's not really a disaster movie , and it involves a romantic subplot but it's not really a romance . I did enjoy the ending when the walls explode and the water gushes into the tunnels . Watch this scene carfully and you'll see a miner with a mutilated face which is obviously a dummy . Oh and if his face has been totally destroyed like that then how's he still able to scream ?
470052	1532177	82533	6.0	Will Probably Appeal To Werewolf Fans MoreThan Casual Viewers	This is a highly regarded movie amongst werewolf fans but I've never been overly impressed by it . I was disappointed by THE HOWLING after seeing it on video in the early 1980s and the fact that I saw AN American WEREWOLF IN London shortly before seeing this does the movie little favour either I think the problem lies in John Sayles screenplay . Go getting journalist ( strange how all journalists in movies are noble crusaders . Real life is entirely different ) Karen White is attacked by a serial killer narrowly surviving and goes off to a rural commune to recuperate . The audience instantly know who these people really are and whats going to happen next . It's not so much telegraphing a screenplay , it's more like making a terribly predictable one . The only reason I wrote a spoiler warning to this review was to guard my back but this is probably unnecessary since it's revealed fairly early on that the people living there are indeed werewolves so there's little in the way of surprises THE HOWLING isn't a total loss because the make up and transformation effects are well done and Patrick Macnee gives a touching performance as Dr George Waggner and there's a really scary moment featuring Eddie the serial killer when he reveals himself to the hero . But despite all this the movie is doubly disappointing when you realise director Joe Dante and screenwriter John Sayles were responsible for PIRANAHA a couple of years before , one of the most entertaining tongue in cheek horror movies ever made . With THE HOWLING they fall back on naming characters after directors who have made werewolf movies and use post modernist dialogue pointing out that a corpse doesn't get up and walk out of a morgue which isn't all that clever or witty
469180	1532177	82817	6.0	It's Not Meant To Be Serious	This is one of Stallone's best films which isn't saying much I know , but still NIGHTHAWKS is an entertaining very dumb thriller . Absolutely nothing in this film is meant to be taken seriously least of all its portrayal of terrorism . Wulfgar is very obviously based on infamous playboy terrorist ' Carlos the Jackal ' but you cant help laughing at Rutgar Hauer as he resembles a Swedish folk singer complete with guitar , or the fact he travels from Europe to NY with a couple of suitcases containing guns and grenades , or laugh at the scene where Da Silva recognises Wulfgar by looking at the artists impression - which in no way resembles Wulfgar . Come on this is a deliberately dumb movie which is a million times more enjoyable than serious films like THE DEVIL'S OWN that deal with terrorism
469577	1532177	106246	6.0	Difficult to relate to	ALIVE opens with a spectacular plane crash but ( No pun intended ) goes quickly downhill from there . ALIVE is based on actual events but is never as good as it should have been , though it's never as bad as it could have been either . The problem I had with the film was that I found it very difficult to relate to the survivors , not because they eat the flesh of the dead - Thankfully this aspect of the film is treated with dignity - but because their characters are so sketchily written . The other problem is that the production team seem to have forgot that it's set thousands of feet up the Andes ! The night after the crash the survivors nearly freeze to death but by the end of the film some of them are sitting around without their jackets on ! Just how warm does it get up there ? All in all ALIVE is adequate but doesn't make us share the feelings of the survivors triumph . For that to happen we must feel we're there with the survivors freezing and starving . I didn't , I felt more like an observer
468394	1532177	95159	6.0	Too Trans-Atlantic	I was going to take issue with the IMDB classing this as an American movie but perhaps I shouldn't . It is financed by American money , distributed by MGM and has both eyes on an American market , two of the main protagonists are played by Americans while the two main British characters are played by John Cleese and Michael Palin who are well known in the States because of MONTY PYTHON ! ! ! ! MILD SPOILERS ! ! ! ! Perhaps this is why I didn't enjoy A FISH CALLED WANDA as much as I should have since comedy plays second fiddle to appealing to a middle American audience . Anglophobic criminal Otto is a one trick pony who hates limeys and calls them " A$$holes " a lot . I'm surprised Kevin Kline won an Oscar for this since he's far from terrific in such an under developed role . John Cleese plays a sort of surrogate Basil Fawlty which is great but he's not awarded enough screen time . If the film revolved around Archie this would have been a far better film . The only bits that made me laugh was the sub plot of animal lover Ken trying to bump off the witness but accidentally killing her dogs one by one and the scene in the cell with George and Archie : George : Tell those pigs to f offArchie : F off pigsOh dear I've mentioned all the funny bits
470217	1532177	90756	6.0	Why Is David Lynch So Popular ? . . . .	. . . . Because he's easy to analyze . Look at the opening sequence to BLUE VELVET - A montage of shots of suburban America followed by a slow pan into the grass where insects crawl from the ground . Don't you get it ? Like the ground there's something ugly trying to break through the calm reassuring surface of suburban America . Gosh what a genius Lynch must be allowing the audience into the concept of subtext like that . But can anyone tell me why he continually casts Kyle McClachlan in his movies ? He's got a pretty face but not much screen presence . But BLUE VELVET isn't a bad film ( Though it's not as good as its high IMDB rating says it is ) , Lynch doesn't go overboard with his often pretentious style of directing and it's a film that would deserve the oft used tag of " Hitchcock style thriller " for the most part , though Dennis Hopper's show stopping performance as the villain is something better suited to a Scorsese picture . But it's Hopper who made BLUE VELVET so memorable for me
468635	1532177	101666	6.0	A Word Of Warning	I saw this on DVD ; " Another breathtaking performance from the Oscar winning star of American Beauty . Kevin Spacey is Darrow " screamed the DVD cover . Turning the case over Kevin Spacey's resume is the most prominent feature pointing out all he films he's won awards for . Ironically for a true life film about truth and justice and law the DVD case doesn't point out that DARROW is a TVM from 1991 when Kevin Spacey wasn't a household name in his own household . Slightly naughty in my opinion to market this DVD as a sort of star vehicle for one of Hollywood's biggest stars But as TVMs go this is pretty good . The production values are good as we see horsedrawn carriages traveling through the streets of America a hundred years ago . But as you may expect DARROW does suffer from a few flaws . First of all there's maybe too many court cases involved to do them all justice . For example the McNamara bombing case and its consequences seems to have enough time dedicated to it , but the Eugene Debs case would have benefitted from more screentime while the summing up of the infamous Leopold / Loeb case takes up more screen time than the case itself , while the scopes monkey trial " My father's most famous case " isn't shown onscreen and is relegated to a voice over . Secondly Spacey seems to be sleep walking through most of the film . He's by no means a bad actor but I do find him slightly overrated and in DARROW I failed to find much indication of star quality . Best acting performance is by Chris Cooper ( Yes that one ) an actor who's as underrated as Spacey is overrated . All in all a good TVM . If you're a Spacey fan you'll certainly like DARROW . If you're not a Spacey fan you'll still find positive points . Just remember that it's a TVM made before Spacey was famous and you won't be disappointed
470381	1532177	1205436	6.0	Good Enough Character Driven Story But With Several Serious Flaws	It's painfully obvious that Russell T Davies produced Who doesn't start reaching its stride until late in the season and he continues the trend here . It's also obvious that he's more than capable of writing a good opening hook and a good ending but what comes inbetween is extremely variable . Turn Left continues the trend also Perhaps the biggest difference between old style Who and its successor is how the classic series was driven by plot while NuWho is character driven . Both styles have their fans and detractors but unfortunately RTD often exploits character while diminishing plotting . The premise of Turn Left revolves around the Doctor never having met Donna Noble in The Runaway Bride and of him dying during that story ad the fall-out that goes with it both literally and metaphorically . It's a very good idea and RTD is great at ideas but unfortunately his plotting is flawed Think about itfor a minute . If the Doctor had died in The Runaway Bride then we'd have seen the witches succeed in The Shakespeare Code and the Daleks complete their plans in the season three Dalek story not to mention the Master taking over planet Earth . In other words Donna's world if not universe would be entirely different from the scenario seen here . RTD is using selective continuity to suit himself . This borders on cheating Talking of continuity leads to other irritants . I don't like obsessive continuity because it's what led to the show being postponed in the mid 1980s when we'd see old foes returning , anorakish references being made left right and centre which panders to the lowest common denominator of the fanbase whilst alienating more mainstream viewers . I do rate Billie Piper as being a talented actress but doubt if she's doing herself any favours by returning to the show . Can anyone seriously think of her as not being Rose Tyler any longer ? On the subject of continuity what is the point of bringing back UNIT if it's nothing like the organisation introduced in the 1968 story The Invasion ? UNIT doesn't even stand for United Nations Intelligence Taskforce - it's now become Unified Intelligence Taskforce and is composed of fat blokes and other minority groups . I bet Douglas Camfield is turning in his grave In short Turn Left is a fair enough story that shows the flexibility of DOCTOR WHO but after seeing it you are left with the impression that the show is running dangerously low on empty from RTD and that the season finale had better be something special
468925	1532177	343687	6.0	Maybe I Expected Too Much	It was a fellow board member of this site who told me about this Kiwi short and taking his advice I watched it . Normally I wouldn't have bothered my behind to set the video because I have very little interest in short films but I'd heard positive things about THE FRENCH DOORS . Alas I was slightly disappointed by it , it's by no means bad in anyway but it suffers from the fault of a great number of short films and that is there's little explanation . It's similar in feel to a Clive Barker short story where style takes precedence over content but again Barker is a writer who leaves the reader wondering what it all meant and I'm left wondering what THE FRENCH DOORS was all about . Of course if you live on your own in a big house out in the country in the middle of nowhere you might just find this film terrifying , and I do admit I jumped out of my seat at the ending but some stories are too enigmatic for their own good and THE FRENCH DOORS is one such story
469122	1532177	105813	6.0	Show , Don't Tell	A man has apparently committed suicide in he New Mexico desert and beside his body is a bag containing $500 , 000 so local sheriff Ray Dolezal decides to keep the dead man's rendezvous to unravel the mystery A lot of people have complained about WHITE SANDS being implausiable , contrived or over plotted . My complaint is that it's really none of these things but suffers from a fundamental flaw we're warned about at basic screen writing course " Show , don't tell " . For much of the screen time the plot twists and turns well enough but ion the last 15 minutes we have to listen to characters state " I'm not how you think I am , I'm really . . . . " or we listen to characters give away the plot which means the climax is very much spoon fed to the audience which is something of a shame since while not being a truly great thriller WHITE SANDS deserves to be remembered more than it really is . I guess the dislodge heavy last act conspires to make this a very forgettable movie
470186	1532177	266555	6.0	A Few Flaws In The Plot But Not A Dead Loss	! ! ! ! ! SPOILERS ! ! ! ! ! A woman is raped by three men then five years later one of the rapists runs into the victim and wants to use her as a sex slave I had a problem with this premise right away - What's the chances of a rapist running into his victim like that ? And why use a former victim as a sex slave ? The plot holes continue with a scene where the victim dispatches one of the trio by hitting him over the head with a plastic bottle filled with water . She could have easily have used a kitchen knife but I suppose that would have been less dramatic . I guess all these vigilante / revenge dramas suffer from the plotholes seen in FREEZER ( As it's called on the sci-fi channel ) where the hero stands at a street corner and by an amazing power of coincidence just happens to chance along a scumbag who murdered his wife or raped his daughter see also THE EXTERMINATOR or DEATH WISHFREEZER does have some artistic worth in it's favour , and despite some violence it is a fairly understated film unlike I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE so the two shouldn't be compared . It's just that FREEZER is spoiled slightly by some unlikely occurances while the plot isn't anything more than " Rape victim increases collective morality of mankind by exterminating some scumbags " type story
470276	1532177	113277	7.0	Good But Overlong	The thing to strike me about HEAT is that it's overlong . I don't know if I've been watching too much MTV but a major problem I've had with a great number of movies coming out of Hollywood studios since the early 1990s is that they're too long for their own good and I wish to add HEAT to this list since its running time is taken up with too many unnecessary scenes . If these scenes had been ditched at script stage not only would we have had a shorter film we'd have had a far better one . Take the scene in the coffee bar where the gang have just carried out the initial heist and Neil teaches Waingro a lesson by banging his head off the table . Seeing as they're shown throghout the story to be well organised , professional villains why would Neil draw attention to themselves by assaulting Waingro in this way ? It's a scene that lacks any credibility and should not have been included . There's another problem with too many domestic scenes , the film tries to show the audience the marital marital / romantic life of every major character , cop and robber . I know Michael Mann's later movie THE INSIDER is also full of scenes involving home life but that's necessary to the plot and characterisation . Here it is not HEAT isn't by any means a bad film , on the contaray it's a good one . DeNiro and Pacino in the same movie , boy what a casting coup . Not only that we get to see Val Kilmer when he was famous plus up and coming names like Portman , Sizemore and Fichtner , and once the story gets going it is very compelling with a breath taking shootout . Unfortunately because someone ( I'm guessing Michael Mann deserves all the blame for this ) thought they'd stretch out a two hour movie into a three hour one HEAT remains good instead of great
469177	1532177	113189	7.0	The Irony Is Enjoyable	Say what you like about the Bond franchise ( And in my opinion I don't have a lot of good things to say ) but the series never came out with the old cliche of having those nasty pinko commies as the bad guys . Bond's enemies where always the fictional SPECTRE or mad scientist types , not that this was always successful of course . But I did enjoy the ironic fact that this new Bond starts his first filmed mission with an attack on a secret USSR base . Even better in this respect is the title sequence where we see the demise of communist icons and as the story progresses we find out the bad guys are ex-communists turned quasi mafia , and the motivation of the main baddie involves a cold war betrayal . All this gives GOLDENEYE a sense of time and place , something that can't be said for most - If any - Bond films . GOLDENEYE is a very good Bond film even if it's not up to classics like DR NO or GOLDFINGER . The production values are certainly a million times better than what we saw in the 80s . Brosnan is fairly good but lacks that serious touch that Dalton and Connery had . The only other complaint I have is that tank sequence which is very silly and interferes with the pace of the film . The one thing that puzzled me though is the main villain . He's played by an actor far too young to have born in the 1940s . I know Anthony Hopkins was to have been originally cast in this role but if that was the case would he have been required to have a really brutal punch up with Bond at the climax ?
469046	1532177	29923	7.0	Possibly The Last Great L & H Picture	BLOCK-HEADS is set up with an idea which must have seemed totally ridiculous in 1938 but when you stop to consider that Japanese soldiers were being found on remote Pacific islands 30 years after the second world war ended the idea stops being ridiculous and becomes shockingly propheticThis is possibly the last of the great L & H movies ( FLYING DUECES being the only other contender ) , after this the comedy duo started appearing in studio features that didn't seem to show much respect to their genius , made them slightly off centre and stretched stories out for almost 90 minutes when a 60 page script would have worked much better This means that BLOCK-HEADS suffers from the mild irritation of so many other Stan and Ollie star vehicles - It's rather episodic . But seeing as it's so funny what have we got to complain about ? Listen out for Stan's tagline " Is there gonna be a fight ? " which is repeated several times and the surreal sequence of closing the blinds on the stairway . Strange when people discuss the films of these two comedy gods they always think of slapstick but forget they were also masters of surrealist visualism too . The funniest moment is probably the final scene in Ollie's apartment involving the married couple from next door I still think THE LAUREL AND MURDER HARDY CASE is the best of their vehicles but BLOCK-HEADS deserves its own mention as being one of the very last superb Stan and Ollie comedies
469104	1532177	395320	7.0	Effective Short Film	Three people sit around a dinner table and right away the audience jump to the wrong conclusion as to who is who and how they all fit into each other's lives . one of the characters then decides she's not been getting enough sex and decides to do something about it but sex like love and career never EVER goes according to plan Ruth Coulson's short film is a good enough example to show how to make an effective short . Despite lasting only eight minutes it contains enough twists and turns to keep the audience amused and contains some bitterly salty dialogue . Let's be honest the jibe about Hampstead Heath while not being politically correct does sound like the sort of thing a sexually frustrated heterosexual woman might say to a gay friend . It's also good to see a short film containing at least one actress ( Claire Goose ) the audience might recognise
469135	1532177	157505	7.0	Superb Short Film	I've never been a fan of short films . Never have been never will be , but the technical aspects of THE DANCE OF THE SHIVA are superb like the scene where the Indian NCO braves shell fire to save a British officer . In fact I could spend a lot of time praising the technical aspects of this short but I won't bother , I'll just recommend you watch this to understand why I like it . I should perhaps also mention the script by Joseph Miller contains scenes that pull the rug from under the audience like " the hospital scene in India " at the end , and praise too that Miller hasn't painted these Hindu warriors as victims of white European imperalism either . In fact I was shocked to see that neither Miller or director Jaime Payne haven't gone onto do more in their careers which is a pity because they do have obvious talent As a footnote I was also shocked to see that two voters on this board have awarded DANCE OF THE SHIVA . What ? These two voters think this short film is the worst thing they have ever seen ? I guess they must be from Pakistan
468850	1532177	403576	7.0	At Least The Female Lead Is Attractive	SUPERVIRILITY came about through the success of THE LOVERS GUIDE which allowed people to go into High St stores and buy what is to all intents soft core porn without feeling guilty . I emphasise " soft core " because this isn't one of these videos that has a lot of very explict sex scenes looking for a plot - It's an educational tape about how to improve your sex life with several long sequences of two sex therapists facing the camera pointing out that you have to work on improving sex . There's something frightfully British about this and the video is rather condescending in parts - An unattractive body can lead to poor sex ! But I thought personality is what counted when it came to love ? Anyway despite this what about the " stars " of SUPERVIRILITY ? Let's face it the real reason people watch these educational tapes is so they can see people having sex and the couple featured Marino Franchi and Kathryn Shannon do make a strangely contrasting couple . Marino looks like a cave man while the absolutely beautiful Kathryn looks like butter wouldn't melt in her mouth ( DON'T ! ) but the love making scenes which don't come until about two thirds of the way into the running time and because of home video standards in Britain are somewhat restrained compared to videos Marino would later appear in Having said that I doubt Marino Franchi has made love to anyone as attractive as Kathryn Shannon and believe it not they were a real life couple in a relationship when this video was made . I guess the message of SUPERVIRILITY is if you want a really gorgeous girlfriend visit the gym more often while slipping down the evolutionary ladder
469197	1532177	70735	7.0	Entertaining	THE STING can't be described as a masterwork of cinema but that's not really its intention . It's sole agenda is to entertain and it succeeds . Director George Roy Hill brings a heavily stylised almost comic book form to the movie . Scott Joplin ragtime score is extremely memorable but the best aspect to the film is the cast , Newman , Redford and Shaw make a good team and it's sad they didn't make more films together . Please Mr Hollywood Producer do NOT do a remake with George Clooney and Brad Pitt . David S Ward's script is good but it's not flawless since it contains one subplot too many ( The subplot about Doyle Lonnegan hiring a top hitman ) which is basically unnecessary and disposable . All in all a very entertaining film
469897	1532177	75784	7.0	Good Account Despite The Monty Bashing	I loved THE LONGEST DAY when I saw it as a child in the mid 1970s but have gone off it over the years because the characters are more like carichtures rather than real people and the dialogue sounds more like thought processes rather than spoken speech . I guess this is down to Cornelius Ryan not understanding the difference in writing a book and writing a screenplay . The film version of A BRIDGE TOO FAR the second of Ryan's trilogy giving the definitive account of the last year of the war in Europe is superior to THE LONGEST DAY simply because William Goldman has written a superior script than the one Ryan wrote . I can only fault Goldman's script for two things1 ) Some obvious exposition throughout the first 45 minutes , though this probably isn't a fair criticism unlike . . . . . 2 ) The Monty bashing . Along with SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and BAND OF BROTHERS this movie doesn't fail to put the boot into General Bernard Law Montgomery with a bunch of German Generals stating " Not even Eisenhower would be stupid enough to use Montgomery " and you do get the impression some people who get their history via war films will quickly come to the conclusion that Monty was the worst commander in human military history , never mind British military history . If Monty had a fault - And the only time it showed itself was during Operation MarketGarden - it was that he was too cautious but it should be remembered that he spent several years fighting on the Western front during the first world war . The likes of Patton , McArthur and future US president Harry S Trumann also fought in that conflict but America didn't enter WW1 until the spring 1917 and didn't contribute to any significant fighting until almost a year later . Unlike the British the future American commanders didn't experience a slaughter house like the Somme which had a profound effect of on Monty's psyche . It should also be remembered that no Western leader was better for turning a holding action into an offensive as seen at El Alamein and there was no better Western leader than Monty for a defensive holding action as seen at operation Goodwood in June 1944 . The problem with operation MarketGarden was logistics , intelligence reports , communications and just plain bad luck , not leadershipThat criticism aside Goldman ' script is a good one . Of course some facts and figures have been changed or omitted but the script does point out that great courage was shown by both sides and Goldman must be congratulated for including a scene where a Waffen SS trooper dies in a brave but vain attempt to save his commanding officer who is burning to death . The Waffen SS committed countless atrocities during the war but they were Nazi Germany's elite fighting force also capable of extreme bravery under fire so it's good to see a more balanced view of history , something not seen in more critically aclaimed productions like BAND OF BROTHERS and SAVING PRIVATE RYANIt's a shame A BRIDGE TOO FAR didn't do all that well at the box office or receive the critical acclaim it deserved , but STAR WARS came out at the same time thereby destroying the popularity of historical blockbusters with all star casts . It should also be pointed out that the anti-war sentiments of the film are surpassed by Vietnam movies like APOCALYPSE NOW and PLATOON but how do you make an anti-war film featuring the second world war as a backdrop unless you're a German ? I remember talking to my schoolmates in 1982 after this was shown on TV the previous night and we all agreed at the time this was the best war movie ever made . Looking back now it's not , but it's still a very good account of men in battleFootnote : Check out Ryan's book THE LAST BATTLE , the final - And best - book in the trilogy that tells of the last months of the second world war
469730	1532177	120324	7.0	A Simple Plot . . . .	. . . . But a very good one even if it does owe its premise to SHALLOW GRAVE . Unlike the British movie Scott B Smith's script is very well developed and contains sympathetic characters and is far better paced in a tale of how money is the root of all evil . In fact there's very little I can criticise about the screenplay except for one thing : If someone is killed in an accident surely they'd be an autopsy in which case the cause of death would be established as not being from an accident . Am I right ? Regardless this is a very intelligent thriller which led me to ask why director Sam Raimi doesn't make more human dramas like this one
469190	1532177	1000259	7.0	Jacobi Is A Class Act	Utopia is a strange beast . It is in effect the start of of a three parts 45 minute story , equivalent to six episodes of the classic series . However re-watching it again you may become aware of the flaws of RTD vision of DOCTOR WHO . It's set on an alien planet which is only to be welcomed , but unfortunately it's quite literally a stone quarry in England something the classic series suffered from . Surely with so much technology available to the show we should be seeing something more impressive . Similarly why is said quarry full of extras from MAD MAX ? The fact that Neil Marshall's film DOOMSDAY failed says a lot by having every post apocalypse scenario populated by butch psychopaths running around in leather - it shows a complete lack of imagination . It also suffers from a lack of internal logic . We're told hat " There hasn't been an university for a thousand years " but somehow the refugees have trucks and firearm available to them . Surely you'd have university standard engineers etc in order to build and maintain such things ? The return of Capatain Jack may be well received by gay men and heterosexual women in the audience but it's obvious he's being used as a plot device by RTD in order to drive the plot forward , a plot that is very threadbare when you examine it There is a massive plus though and that is the casting of Sir Derek Jacobi as Professor Yana . Jacobi gives without doubt the most memorable of a guest on Nu-Who . It's poignant , moving and totally touching . The only problem is that when he's on screen you start to notice the lack of presence by the rest of the cast . It's somewhat painful to realise what a great Doctor he would have been if a previous producer had cast him in the 1980s . Jacobi's performance makes up for the episode's numerous flaws and makes me give Utopia
470264	1532177	59113	7.0	Flawed But Still A Very Good Movie	Russian literature ? I know of it but haven't read too much of it . From what I'm told Tolstoy , Dostoyevski et al don't exactly make for good bed time reading . I guess Boris Pasternak keeps up this tradition with his novel DOCTOR ZHIVAGO being a bit too top heavy with characters and incidents and it's this that has led to many critics putting the boot into the film on its initial release You could say that David Lean is the natural director for this kind of movie since he gives the word " Epic " a whole new meaning . Unfortunately he's not exactly the type of director who can make a tight script even tighter . The story contains a few too many characters and subplots ( Though this is probably the fault of the studio and screenwriter Robert Block more than Lean's ) that leaves the audience wondering if it's a love story or a history lesson . It should also be pointed out that despite having some very memorable scenes like the frozen Russian bodies in a winter landscape , the train door covered in ice and the White Russian kids being machine gunned you still have to sit through a lot of talky scenes . However I'm going to be kind . DOCTOR ZHIVAGO works best when we're shown the birth of the Soviet Union , a wonderful ideal born out of the carnage from the Great War that ended up becoming in many ways even more terrible than Nazi Germany . Pasha starts by naively handing out seditious pamphlets speaking out against the Tsarist police state and ends up by becoming a communist despot , a good piece of character study showing that when people are given total power it will consume them totally . Oh and let's not forget the cast all of them are convincing but there's too many to mention by name so I'll just point out that Guiness is as superb as always and Stieger is absolutely breath taking , and it's shocking to think this great character actor went onto to star in straight to video films in the 1980s and 90s . Strangely the one performance I will always remember in this film is a cameo by Klaus Kinski as a prisoner on the train ! So a very good film but not a classic mainly down to the fact that has many memorable scenes surrounded by even more stodgy scenes . In other words you'll remember the great parts long after you've forgotten the boring bits which means you'll be slightly disappointed after seeing it again several years later
468378	1532177	217869	8.0	Great Movie	It's always the sign of a good movie when you feel for the characters . When your initial sorrow for a character in a film is replaced by a sense of guilt for having sympathy for them at the end then that is the sign of a great movie . There , that's all I'm going to say about the characters and plot of UNBREAKABLE in case I spoil the shock twist at the end which is every bit effective and even more original than M . Night Shymalan's SIXTH SENSE . It seems opinions are divided for this movie with some people thinking it's a disappointment while some people think it's a classic . I fall into the latter and if Steven Spielberg had directed this it would be hailed as a masterpiece

You often wonder why people go onto game shows considering they're so retarded well in this one off edition of FAMILY FORTUNES we're left wondering why some people should be allowed to reproduce . Take this exampleQ : Name something you open ? A : Your legs Talk about a one track mind . There was one contestant who was so stupid that he features several times Q : Name a famous Arthur ? A : ShakespeareHe might misheard the question as " Name a famous author ? " but this guy is a right dummy because the idiocy continues Q : Name a famous Irishman ? A : Disraeli And then in a classic TV moment we see him going for the big money bit at the end of the show with Max Bygraves asking the questionsQ : Name something you take to the beach ? A : Turkey Q : Something you buy in a supermarket ? A : Turkey Q : Something that gets stuffed ? A : Oh , turkey The noise sounds for time up and the camera cuts to the contestants family one of whom can be clearly seen to mutter the " F " and " C " words . Looks like the turkey wasn't the only thing to get stuffed when everyone got home . Bygraves retorts " You've just won two weeks in Turkey , and you've won some money so you can take that back to the lunatic asylum " Mr Dummy gives a good natured laugh and the camera cuts back to his family who are giving him hate filled looks and who at any moment may just do something that you'd expect to see on THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW A very funny one off show , but if I remember correctly there were a couple of other editions that followed that weren't half as good
470034	1532177	21738	8.0	Guys This Is A Great And Funny Short	It's not often I feel I have to defend something on this site but after seeing CHICKENS COME HOME a few days ago I must say I'm slightly puzzled as to why some people think it's not as good as made out . I remember seeing this as a young child and enjoying it immensely and after seeing it again as an adult it's - Unlike a few other L & H shorts - just as enjoyable now Yeah the flaws with this short are the same with any other one in that the performances are very stagy with lots of shouting and over emphatic mannerisms but no one ever complains about that in other short films featuring Stan and Ollie and unlike a lot of the other shorts CHICKENS COME HOME does feature a coherent plot instead of a lot of episodic incidents Some people have moaned that the duo are kept apart from each other hence this is somehow less of a success but that's all down to opinion because I was very impressed with the fact Stan and Ollie were both funny on their own throughout the running time with Ollie getting the lion's share of laughs . Come on anyone with a pulse and a sadistic sense of humour will wet themselves as Mr Hardy sings " Somebody's coming to my house " or screams when he sees an indiscreetly placed photograph but the best moments are the ones featuring Ollie and his Butler who knows too much . If I remember correctly there was a situation comedy from over 20 years ago featuring Keith Barron and Carlos Douglas called DUTY FREE with a very similar premise
469009	1532177	122690	8.0	Short On Thought . Long On Thrills	RONIN is to all intents and purposes a highly intelligent thriller , or so it would seem on the surface . Unfortunately when you start to examine the plot and structure of the movie it starts to fall apart . These " Ronin " characters - Who are they ? Who employed them ? Where was the job advertised ? It's never really revealed , perhaps just as well since it'd be impossible to explain how such a motley bunch can be taken seriously . Notice one of the characters is a Walter Mitty type but can get the group any type of gun they want , and is this Walter Mitty guy really necessary to the plot ? , he's written out after 20 minutes and it's difficult to understand why he was included by the final draft . Let's look at the plot . In his book STORY : THE PRINCIPLES OF SCREENWRITING Robert Mckee explained that when he was a script reader for Hollywood studios he'd only be sent two types of script neither of which really worked , one being an understructured real life type drama and an overstructured action thriller involving an object all the great powers want to get their hands on . RONIN certainly sums up the second type of script , the CIA , the Russians , the IRA and quite possibly the winter olympics commitee are after something that will change the world as we know it and it's up to this group of hired guns to cross , double cross and triple cross one another to get their hands on it RONIN could have turned out a complete mess and despite the movie never being as clever as it thinks it is neither does it become the complete debacle it could have become . My exceedingly high entertainment thresholds were met and then some more and much of it had to do with the cast . This movie hardly features DeNiro's greatest performance but considering the complete rubbish he's appeared in since the early 1990s he's by no means bad and does manage to bring some moral charm to his character . Jean Reno and Stellan Skarsgard are two of the greatest actors Europe has produced in the last twenty years and it's very interesting to see these fine actors in a high octane Hollywood thriller and British Equity is very well represented with Sean Bean and Jonathan Pryce A highly effective and entertaining thriller which at times is over complicated and plot bare at the same time . Can you imagine the mess Jerry Brukheimer and Michael Bay would have made of this ?
469928	1532177	78480	8.0	Even This Cynical Viewer Was Enthralled By This Exciting Animated Adventure	I had absolutely no knowledge of WATERSHIP DOWN was going to be about except that it featured rabbits in some capacity . I had an inkling it was going to be some patronising , juvenile crap that anyone above the age of seven would find nauseating . It says something about the quality of television on the run up to Christmas when a bitter and twisted 39 year old man sits down to watch a feature length about talking rabbits - Talking rabbits ! OMG , it's not like the author Richard Adams meant the story to be some drug metaphor is it ? OMG talking rabbits just how pathetic is that ? And the one thing that I remembered on its initial release - And which I'm still trying to forget to this very day - is that gawd awful song by the guy with the worst hairstyle in the history of pop music . You know the song . . . . " bright eyes burning like fire " . Bad enough I saw BARNEY'S BIG ADVENTURE the previous day . Now I was going to be watching equally childish sentimental crap with talking rabbits Oh hold on . I've just seen WATERSHIP DOWN this very minute . Can everyone reading this review please ignore erroneous phrases like " Childish pathetic crap " because this is not how the story plays out . I do confess that perhaps the original story has perhaps been slightly flawed in the adaption with the hierarchy of the original warren somewhat unexplained ( For example why is it treason to leave the warren and search for a new one ? ) but that is my one and only criticism of this superb animated adventure which can be enjoyed by anyone of any age In a nut shell WATERSHIP DOWN resembles one of those post apocalypse dramas by John Wyndham or more especially John Christopher except instead of humans it features rabbits that talk . No seriously forget all about the characters being humanized bunnies , this is a dark dramatic adventure where survivors of an eco-disaster try and find sanctuary in a bleak , desolate and dangerous world . As crazy as it sounds some people have picked up on the coincidence that the plot resembles 28 DAYS LATER and one can't help thinking that it's a little bit stronger than coincidence . If you've seen one you can't noticing the quite striking similarities between the two especially the climax . Of course it could be that the original novel of WATERSHIP DOWN was influenced by Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS which seems to have influenced much of Alex Garland's work but even so A thoroughly enthralling adventure that may have children weeping at the sad bits will certainly keep adults interested as they try and spot analogies . Let me repeat once again that while there's sad scenes there is nothing sickeningly sentimental and is a shockingly sophisticated tale . I certainly rate as being one of the greatest British productions of the 1970s
468673	1532177	90605	8.0	By Far The Best Movie In The Franchise	I remember having a conversation with a work colleague in 1983 on horror films ( In those days video nasties like I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE and NIGHT OF THE DEMON were all the rage ) and he mentioned that he thought ALIEN was a great film . " Hmm " I replied " I didn't think it was that good Benny . It would have been better if there was more people getting killed by lots of aliens and a lot more action " It could be that James Cameron over heard my conversation and decided he was going to make a sequel solely to please me , but it's more logical to assume that he recognised the obvious faults of the pretentious arthouse original and went for a no holds action blockbusterI really loved the action setpieces of ALIENS , the flames , the explosions , the gunfire , the high body count and the nerve jangling tension . Cameron does a great job and unlike his later films never goes overboard on the production values and a special mention should go to realistic little things like costume design . All too often directors shoot themselves in the foot by making the future look futuristic and fail because of it , check out UFO , THE GREEN SLIME and SPECE 1999 for a few examples , but here the costumes look very functional as opposed to futuristic . And Cameron has written a very good - though possibly overlong - script . Notice that it has - Unlike his script for RAMBO FIRST BLOOD PART TWO - a slightly left of centre viewpoint with the marines being jingoistic American stereotypes and the bad guy being a corperate capitilist ? This no accident on the part of the screenwriter I'm sureSo with a few rare exceptions like MAD MAX 2 this is a film that outdoes the original . I know that some critics prefer Ridley Scott's version and they're entitled to their veiwpoint but Cameron proved the doom mongers ( And there was a lot of them in 1985 ) wrong when they announced that ALIENS wouldn't come close to equalling never mind surpassing the original . I've no idea what Benny thought of ALIENS though
468911	1532177	86312	8.0	Compelling Drama	A common question to this movie is : If Karen Silkwood and her colleagues are so worried about being contaminated by plutonium at a processing plant then why do they smoke so many cigarettes if they're worried about their health ? Duh Because they volunteered to smoke ! They're adults and as adults they should be able to choose their own paths to hell . Even in 1973 the setting of this bio-pic everyone knew the risks of smoking related diseases and it's their health so if they want to ruin their health why should they be stopped from doing so ? ! ! ! ! MILD SPOILERS ! ! ! ! I don't know if it's irony on the point of director Mike Nichols but there does seem to be an awful lot of cigarette consumption in this movie . Certainly if there's any one wanting to give up the weed they should give this movie a miss . But the point remains that in 1973 ciggie packets carried government health warnings and everyone knew of the dangers even though they didn't want to admit it . Was the plutonium industry quite so honest ? What I liked about this collaboration between director Nichols and screenwriters Alice Arlen and Nora Ephron is that the audience is allowed to think for themselves on the issue of conspiracies and possible state sanctioned murders . Was Karen Silkwood bumped off for knowing too much and for being a trouble maker ? Possibly states the film but much of this is left somewhat ambiguous unlike say JFK by Oliver Stone . Likewise Karen's urine sample . Was it tampered with or was the radiation levels high because Karen was contaminated by a plutonium leak ? Once again the audience is left to make up there own minds Some people have criticized SILKWOOD because it feels very much like one of those cheap TVMs that even having a well known cast can't disguise . I won't disagree too much but this is because films of the period lacked much gloss and you can probably use the opposite argument in that nowadays Hollywood movies feature too much gloss and visual superficiality . Compare SILKWOOD with THE INSIDER or ERIN BROCKOVICH and make up your own mind if one's not glossy enough or the other two are too glossy to be effective . Certainly Nichols directs a scene where Karen walks through detectors and a jump cut occurs where she is undergoing decontamination procedure . I have no idea why but this scene shocked me to the core and this scene alone makes SILKWOOD a very memorable movie
468770	1532177	385705	8.0	Nick Love's First And Perhaps Last Great Film	An auteur is regarded as a director who has a running theme throughout their resume . For example Robert Aldrich is considered a " sadistic " director and whileis films may be tame compared to the video nasty era the likes of TOO LATE THE HERO and ULZANA'S RAID do still come across as compellingly blood thirsty and violent . The films of Martin Scorsese usually involve protagonists being caught in an existentialist quicksand where the more they try and find their goal in life the more they sink into a problem of their own making . Let's not get too caught up in the auteur theory however because much of it is simply down to movie studios assigning scripts to well suited directors " Hey Marty , we've got a script here featuring a deranged loner wanting to join the mob . Bob and Leonardo have already signed on the dotted line . You interested ? " . Nevertheless it's obvious that Nick Love in the years ahead will be honoured in this fashion if only because his films feature blackly comical stories of working class British males fed up with the state of the nation In terms of style and execution THE FOOTBALL FACTORY isn't a million miles away from the likes of TRAINSPOTTING and TWO SMOKING BARALLS . It's very quirky , rather episodic , fairly violent and oh so bloody entertaining . You could say it contains all the flaws of recent British movies like an overuse of the words " FAHKIN ' " and " KANT " but we are talking about the notorious Chelsea headhunters football hooligans and there are admittedly some unlikely coincidences involved such as two of the headhunters burgling a house that belongs to . . . but unlike Love's later OUTLAW you never feel at how contrived these plot twists are which probably says much of the film's entertainment factor . It could also be that the original source was strong in the first place since I get the feeling that Love totally fails as a screenwriter of original material , certainly the problem with OUTLAW was an underdeveloped script with very underwritten characters who lacked a recognisable motive . Here it's obvious but never overstated that the motivation of becoming a hooligan is to belong to something . And unlike in OUTLAW when something funny happens in THE FOOTBALL FACTORY you genuinely do laugh instead of scratching your head wondering if in fact it's supposed to be funny I have to confess that I've seen the feature films of Love back to front . I saw OUTLAW when it opened in the cinema in March , I saw THE BUSINESS a couple of months after that and saw THE FOOTBALL FACTORY for the first time last week . If Nick Love had released his films in that order then I would have said that here is a film maker who is really hitting his stride as his films just get better and better . Unfortunately what this means in reality is that Love is on a downhill curve and that nothing has come close to matching THE FOOTBALL FACTORY . One can only hope that the big screen remake of THE SWEENEY , a TV show well remembered for its mixture of black comedy and violence , will see a return to form for an underrated auteur
469569	1532177	102926	8.0	Very Effective Thriller But Ultimately Overrated	It's impossible to comment on SILENCE OF THE LAMBS as being a mere film . Its release was a watershed in popular culture and has influenced a myriad of imitations that are far too numerous to mention . Much of this success is down to director Jonathan Demme who has made the film so effective by coming up with the strikingly simple idea of filming everything in dim lighting which gives SILENCE a moody and brooding atmosphere that was absent from movies in the previous decade . Ironically enough this is as typical of 90s film making as MANHUNTER was of 80s movies . Howard Shore's score also helps the proceedings and Jodie Foster gives a sublime nuanced performance as vulnerable heroine Clarice Starling . Watch the scenes closely when Clarice is in the company of men , don't you get the feeling she has a phobia about the male of the species . Is she a victim of sexual abuse in her childhood ? A lesbian ? We never find out but Foster's performance is multi layered and it's a pity this aspect is never explored in HANNIBAL which sadly deletes this aspect to Clarice Sadly SILENCE was released with a tidal wave of hype which the film doesn't live up to . Who can forget the stories that upon seeing this at the cinema certain audience members wanted armed escorts back to their cars ! I'm sorry but despite being a good thriller it's not that good and I fail to see how people were turned into quivering jellies unable to sleep with the lights off . I'm also afraid to say that much of the awards heaped upon the film aren't that well deserved either . Foster deserved the Oscar as did the film and possibly Demme too but did Ted Tally for his adapted screenplay ? All he seems to have done is to copy the best bits of Harris's novel wholesale into the screenplay without making an effort to improve anything . and i'll probably be accused of sacrilege but the more times I see this film the more times I ask myself how did Hopkins win the Oscar for Best Actor ? I don't even think Hopkins should have qualified for the Best Actor category since the role isn't on screen long enough and his performance is slightly hammy . Hannibal as played by Hopkins resembles something along the lines of a paedophile rather than a serial killer who has maimed , murdered and munched on adults . Despite having some reservations of Brian Cox as Hannibal in MANHUNTER you do believe his burly presence does have the physical strength to overpower his victims , not so Hopkins I know it's very difficult , perhaps even impossible , but the best way to enjoy this movie is to erase from your mind the fact that it's one of only three movies to have picked up the Oscar in all five main categories , the fact that it made headlines about being the most terrifying film committed to celluloid , and the fact that it stands as the 28th best movie ever on this website . It is a very good thriller but one that is ultimately disappointing after hearing of the hype surrounding it
468462	1532177	275235	8.0	I Remember This Haunting Political Thriller	SPOILERS TO PLOT I remember this being shown on Channel 4 in 1987 . It starts off with a young student played by a then unknown John Hannah jogging through the streets of Glasgow to the accompaniment of a wonderful pseudo operatic sound track . Stopping at a bridge the student witnesses the murder of a child by the mysterious Brond . As the story progresses the student finds himself used as a pawn by Brond to trap a Scottish nationalist terrorist cell and a top IRA terrorist END SPOILERS BROND is a political thriller you'll either love or hate . It was similar to several serials at the time like THE ONE GAME or WIPEOUT where you could easily find yourself confused as to what's happening as the plot unravels . You could also find Michael Caton Jones directorial style very pretentious and irritating but I loved it . I especially loved the haunting operatic sound track and feel slightly sad that no one has updated this page as to who composed the music for the show . And watch out for the appearance of a Special Branch officer who is played by Christopher Ellison . It's very easy to see why he was cast as Frank Burnside on THE BILLI can't wait to see this again . Any chance of a repeat Channel 4 ? Update Oct 2005 : Thank you very much for the info about the title music
469855	1532177	129387	9.0	One Of The Funniest Films Ever Made	I don't like comedies but I do enjoy much of the Farrelly Brothers stuff and THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY is their greatest achievment which is probably down to their casting . Ben Stiller is perfect as Ted while Matt Dillon is absolutely outstanding as sleazy ( And boy do I mean sleazy ) private investigator Pat Healy . My only criticism is of Cameron Diaz who's slightly bland , but she is attractive and that's all that mattersI suppose how funny you'll find this film is down to your own subjective opinion of what should or shouldn't be made fun of . I'll be honest and say that jokes featuring stalking , serial killers , semen , spiking doggie snacks with drugs and learning difficulties are all fair game , and perhaps I'm being too honest in saying I laughed out loud at these serious subjects being made fun of ? Sorry if this review has been very short but I find it difficult to write hundreds of words about a film I love
468381	1532177	75314	9.0	Explains What It's Like To Be Male	SPOILERS How would anyone be able to relate to Travis Bickle ? He's a freak show , a fantasist and a loner who watches porn films in cinemas with a cola in one hand and a candy bar in another and to all intents and purposes is an assassin and a stalker , but he also strikes a cord with any man who's been angry and young and rejected . He's an outsider that society has turned its back on : " Why won't you talk to me " is the heartbreaking question every young angry man screams at the world when he's very aloneScorsese directs Paul Schrader's low concept script on a shoestring budget - That's not a criticism , quite the reverse because this leads to a hyper-realism and it'd be impossible to think that a major Hollywood studio would produce something like this nowadays where everything is about making money while playing it safe : A character study of a disturbed loner ? 12 year old prostitutes ? Vigilante executions ? Too controversial , not enough explosions , not enough CGI . If there's a flaw in the screenplay it's at the end where Travis wipes out the pimp business and becomes a hero which left me confused . Doesn't society punish murderers even if they kill scum that use 12 year olds as prostitutes ? Even if he was cleared by the jury surely Travis would still have stood trial for murder ? but this is never referred to in the closing scenes , but I guess this is a comment on how society can quickly make a hero out of a villain and how a nobody can become the talk of the town , but still it seems to go against the grain of the script where we - Or at least the young males in the audience - recognise that an uncaring society is the villain where as Travis is the hero all along Despite the flawed ending of the screenplay ( Which is superb untill the last ten minutes ) this is still a movie masterpiece with Scorsese getting an acting tour de force from his cast . Jodie Foster as a child who sells her body on the streets of New York , a totally disturbing , brilliant performance , and DeNiro and Keitel in the same movie ! I've no idea if this is just hype but I heard all the stage schools in the USA were swamped at the time by applications from applicants in Compton , Hell's Kitchen , South Central and The Bronx who'd seen DeNiro and Keitel in the " I'm hip " scene ( A scene that was totally adlibbed by the actors ) and decided that acting could be cool and macho after all . As I said I don't know how true this is but the performances of these two actors has given a massive amount of credibility to the acting profession and it really is sad to see the DeNiro of today churn out so much garbage . This his greatest performance . I also rate it as Scorsese's best movie As a footnote may I recommend to all the angry young men reading this review to track down the albums of Matt Johnson aka The The especially the mid 80s albums SOUL MINING and INFECTED which have lyrics that could have been written by Travis himself . Matt is a great fan of Scorsese and it shows
469782	1532177	68435	9.0	A Great Film That Has Jerry Bruckheimer In The Credits !	I normally hate westerns but I could watch THE CULPEPPER CATTLE COMPANY over and over again . This a bleak nihilistic extremely well written western that's also understated . Don't you get a feeling that Frank Culpepper built his cattle business through illegal activities ? This is never disclosed but the signs are there . Best of all is the characterisation , man there's some really nasty people here , imagine the school bullies from hell riding about on horses and you've got the idea and the cast make the most of their roles , special mention goes to Geoffrey Lewis and Bo Hopkins . The only reason I can think off why IMDB members have given this film a relatively low vote is because they're turned off by the violence and amorality of this film . Well I guess if you were brought up on the all American values of John Wayne's wild west THE CULPEPPER CATTLE COMPANY may very well shock you . Perhaps the most shocking thing is the fact that the associate producer is one Jerry Bruckheimer ! Yes it's that Jerry Bruckheimer the man who produced shallow popcorn blockbusters like BEVERLY HILLS COP , TOP GUN , ARMAGEDDON and PEARL HARBOR and who is probably the most powerful figure in Hollywood today But don't let the name of Bruckheimer put you off this great film , this is every bit as great as THE WILD BUNCH which also featured Bo Hopkins in a similar role
468858	1532177	167260	10.0	A Breathtaking Conclusion To Cinema's Greatest Fantasy Epic	It takes a miracle for me to go the cinema since smoking is banned in cinema chains but Peter Jackson is a miracle worker . How else would he be able to make me forget my filthy and disgusting nicotine addiction ? He made me forget all about cigarettes for three hours with THE TWO TOWERS and I knew that with RETURN OF THE KING he could make me forget all about ciggies for a record breaking three and a half hours . I booked my ticket for Rothesay winter gardens cinema and sat down to be enthralled ! ! ! ! ! SPOILERS ! ! ! ! ! I do conclude there are some people in the world who can't see what the fuss is about with the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy . My parents seem slightly puzzled that their cynical critical son loves LOTR . It's simply explained , these epic movies aren't a childish fantasy , they're like David Lean filming a Shakespeare play , but I do take onboard the criticism that the story structure of the movies can be irritating . FELLOWSHIP is very stop-start while the action intercutting in TTT can be annoying but ROTK has probably the best pace and structure of the three . ROTK starts with a sequence showing Smeagol murdering his friend in order to get the ring . This gives some needed backstory to Gollum . It also sets up its stall that it's not a family film never mind a " childish fantasy " . In fact I predict that many of the children in Rothesay cinema will be having nightmares tonight due to the scenes with that horrible big spider , it made my skin crawl and the woman sitting next to me was gasping out loud as it prepared to cocoon poor Frodo , you should have seen the Q for the toilet after that scene which tells you how convincing the FX are in this movie , nothing appears CGI : Gollum isn't computer generated he's a living being and Peter Jackson doesn't use camera trickery for fight scenes he uses million upon millions of extras . He is David Lean reincarnated . No he is David Lean AND Will Shakespeare reincarnated , look at the way the cast act their parts , it's like they're appearing in the greatest play of the bard . Their performances are superlativeThere are some flaws . I did mention the script gives background to Smeagol but the script - Like the other films in the trilogy - is somewhat uneven . John Noble's character Denethor seems somewhat underwritten and I wasn't sure what his motivation was . Also as everyone else has mentioned the false endings are very irritating . When Aragorn is crowned king and the screen faded to black the audience reached for their Jackets and bags then we're shown another scene lasting several minutes which faded to a blaze of music . Everyone reached for their bags and jackets , then another scene which . . . It would have been better to have seen Aragorn crowned King and then seen Frodo sailing into the distance but I guess after the screenwriters have irritated us with the abrupt endings of the first two movies it's somewhat traditional to irritate with the end of the trilogy . These faults I can forgive but there is an unforgivable cop out of having an army of the undead charging to save the race of men from the Orc army at the end . It didn't ruin the movie for me but it just seems so lazy and contrived which stopped me from thinking it was the best movie in the trilogy , it's not , FELLOWSHIP is . But still this is a masterpiece of cinema which like cigarettes left me breathless and satisfied and hopefully we'll see it sweep the Oscar ceremony at lastAs for the Oscars themselves I'm puzzled about a couple of things . Howard Shore's score is beautiful and haunting but it's far from original with much of the music in ROTK re-used from FELLOWSHIP ( The Gondor theme ) and TTT ( The Celtic music ) while the omissions are even more surprising . No nominations for any of the actors ! I know that all the great performances would cancel each other out but it's shameful Andy Serkis wasn't nominated as best supporting actor . Can anyone name a more unlikable baddie than Gollum in recent cinema ? Me neither and no nomination for cinematography ! I've no idea how John Lesnie's camera was able to keep up with the action and he deserved at least a nomination so maybe we'll see the third instalment robbed on Oscar night like FELLOWSHIP was . Even if it is that doesn't stop me and millions of other film fans from recognising the genuis of Peter Jackson . I bow to you Sir
469057	1532177	772457	10.0	An Absolute Classic	Even an old cynical DOCTOR WHO fan like myself can be left breathless by watching an episode of my favourite show . It happened previously during Eccleston's finale and it happened watching this episode . It doesn't happen often though but The Impossible Planet is an example of both the show and of television at its very , very best . This is stunning television The Doctor and his companion land in a mysterious place where they see strange writing on the wall and the audience ( Many of who will be moving behind the sofa ) are instantly transfixed . A door opens and horrible monsters start stalking the time travellers . This might have taken up an entire 25 minute episode in the original show but all this takes place in he pre title sequence . You may miss the longer drawn out format of the original show but at least this new series is tightly plotted and if we're treated to a disappointing story then at least it's usually only for one week There is nothing to disappointment a viewer here . It is DOCTOR WHO at its most traditional best . Writer Matt Jones and director James Strong have gone out of their way to make a story that will be regarded for years to come . They do this by constructing a doom laden narrative . The Doctor and Rose lose the Tardis and they're stuck with the protagonists in the far flung future . It's interesting how many stories never feature this type of plot point where the Doctor and his companions no longer have access to the Tardis which makes for a more intriguing type of story . Without doubt the highlight is the scene where Scooti goes to look for Toby only to find him standing on the surface of the planet where he turns and beckons her outside . Everything from acting , make up and Murray Gold's music makes this a scene that genuinely shocks its audience I can imagine immediately after this episode the BBC switchboards received a tsunami of complaints for distressed parents saying how traumatised their children were . That it took them several hours to get them from behind the family sofa and that they're now refusing to sleep with the lights out . To do this complaining would be to deny the magic of DOCTOR WHO . Yes it can terrify and yes such images will burn themselves in to the mind of a child , something they will never forget even if hey live to be a hundred . But I will bet my life that these same " traumatised " children would have spent the week begging that no matter what they'll be allowed to watch the next episode
469697	1532177	288481	10.0	The Greatest Computer Game Ever	CALL TO POWER is turn based computer game but be warned - It's totally addictive . You can choose many nations and many terrains . You start off with a couple of settlers ( That's if you decide on an easy level . For the harder levels you only get one settler ) and build a city then the more you progress your cities the more resources you can get and you have more choices as to what sort of government you can place your civilization under . You can also decide how you want to win the game via defeating your enemies in conflict or getting hold of some alien DNA , but defeating your enemies is much simpler and much more fun . Everything about the game is a joy , the contrast in terrains is good , the colours are good , there's some excellent atmospheric ethnic background music and unlike some other turn based games that I won't mention the game play is relatively fast . The only downside I can think of is that CTP is pretty difficult , it took me months playing it non stop to finally win a game . Oh and it's so involving you might be in danger of losing touch with reality
