468817	1532177	372743	1.0	The Trouble With Democracy . . . .	. . . . Is that any idiot can cast a vote . Take THE 100 GREATEST MOVIE STARS OF ALL TIME yet another list show from Channel 4 . If we're talking about movie stars we're talking about movie stars from all eras of cinema , people like Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy , Spencer Tracy and Kirk Douglas none of whom actually appeared in the top 100 list That's bad enough but Ewan McGregor landed at number 9 ! What an actor who is only convincing playing an Edinburgh junkie is the 9th greatest movie star ever ! I'd thought maybe STAR WAR fans had stuffed the poll but that theory collapsed when I realised Alec Guiness didn't make the list . If McGregor deserves to be number 9 then the entire cast of EASTENDERS deserve to be in the top 50 somewhere . Kevin Spacey landed at the lofty heights of number 4 , another travesty . I will give some of the voters credit for NOT voting DeNiro ( Number 2 ) as the greatest ever movie star . Bob has shamefully let himself down by continually appearing in B movies for many years whilst the winner of the poll Al Pacino does give the impression he has some standards when it comes to appearing in films A very flawed list and I'm getting really fed up with these type of shows from Channel 4 . That's why I didn't vote in their meaningless poll
468499	1532177	249238	1.0	Why Does Britain Bother . . . .	. . . to continually produce badly scripted movies ? Make no mistake , the core problem with THE WEDDING TACKLE is the screenplay . Didn't anyone notice before they started shooting that this film has no premise , no plot and is full of under developed characters ? As soon as the movie started I thought I was going to be watching some sort of bitter / sweet rom-com , then I thought I was going to be watching a bawdy sex comedy , then I thought I was going to be watching a comedy thriller , then I thought I was going to be watching a farce and all these conclusions took place within the first 15 minutes of the movie , which incidentally feels like it was made by a bunch of under talented film students . If people in Britain can't be bothered to develop a script for a cinematic release why should people flock to the cinema to see their movie ? " Anything else you want to warn us about Theo ? " Yes . You know the worst actor in Britain ? , the one from EASTENDERS who got shot by a bunch of daffodills in 1988 then returned to the show last year , you know the actor who's so wooden he only gives a good performance as a forest . Well he plays the villain in THE WEDDING TACKLE which that alone is reason enough to give this thoroughly unentertaining movie a miss " TAXI "
469044	1532177	66212	2.0	I Can't Believe The High Rating	Heist movies play out in an identical formula : Character A meets character B who introduces them to character C . They pull off a scam and it becomes a race for characters A , B and C to stab each other in the back The only difference between PERFECT Friday and other heist movies is that this one is possibly the worst directed one of the lot . Watch the scene near the start when Britt is introduced to Mr Hall in the bank . There supposed to be facing each other but by some ridiculous editing it looks like they're talking to each other's backs when the camera cuts between them . I also couldn't help noticing the poor sound editing which makes every interior scene sound like it was filmed in an empty room regardless of the location Even people who liked this movie mention Peter Hall's bizarre directing . I'm not mentioning it - I'm complaining about and helps make an already boring and unlikely story unwatchable , and I'm shocked that PERFECT Friday has an average user rating of 6 . 9
470188	1532177	281811	2.0	A Real Disaster Of A Movie	! ! ! ! ! MILD SPOILERS ! ! ! ! ! Suppose you were in deadly danger and needed to be totally anon , what would you do ? If you answered " Hide in a cave " you'd probably be right . If you answered something along the lines of " Become a singing sensation at a Las Vegas casino " then you'd probably be carted off somewhere to be force fed anti-psychotic pills . Alternatively you could also be invited to write a script . Guess what ? someone was invited to write a script and it's called DISASTER . Tracy is on the run from a Cult ( That's not a spelling mistake by the way ) and decides to hide out in Vegas as a star singer who's so famous her posters are plastered everywhere . Oh and she doesn't even bother to change her name , only her hairstyle . Do you think this is credible ? Can we expect to see a duo called Osama and Saddam singing The Desert Song at a downtown casino in the near future ? but who needs credibility when you've got Yossi Wein as director Yossi Wein directed such fare as DEATH TRAIN , US SEALS and OCTOPUS 2 so you know what to expect ie not much . If DEATH TRAIN resembled UNDER Siege 2 then DISASTER resembles the original DIE HARD except it's set in a casino , has little in the way of budget , with an unimpressive cast . It's also obvious the bad guy was written with a slimy limey actor in mind but couldn't get Rickman , Oldman or Bean ( Possibly because they saw the script ? ) so a plank of wood was cast instead . In fact I felt really sorry for Mr plank because there's so many flaming explosions in this film ( That's all there is in this movie - explosions ) and I was really worried he might get turned into charcoal Which reminds me the special effects of cars , helicopters and buildings going up in flames are obviously achieved by setting fire to toys - Some child is going to be very upset on Christmas day - while the more convincing . . . sorry less unconvincing effects seem to be stolen from other movies I think Despite all this I couldn't help noticing Tracy has a well developed pair of lungs so maybe her career as a singer isn't as ridiculous as it seemed at first . Tracy's lungs were the only reason I didn't off the TV
469478	1532177	118698	2.0	Pretentious Rubbish	If like me you live in Britain and stay up late you often find obscure films being shown on Channel 4 . One night I stayed up and by chance watched BENT . After I watched I realised I should try going to bed earlyBENT starts off bizarrely with transvestites parading around one of which is Sir Mick Jagger so I was expecting a sort of camp version of CABARET , but explicit scenes of gay sex followed and after that the film descended into a very pretentious and obvioulsy stage based drama where Clive Owen looks grim faced and keeps repeating " This can't be happening " over and over again . And despite what other reviewers have said about this film I found myself feeling nothing except terminal boredom . In short this is the type of film that ruins the British film industry but which Britain continues to make despite a very limited market . And no I'm not being homophobic . If the characters had been , Jews , Slavs , trade unionists , communists or any other type of victim of Nazism I would still have hated this film
468646	1532177	105344	2.0	Not THE BREAKFAST CLU	A few people on this page have compared SECRETS to a sort of Aussie 60s version of THE BREAKFAST CLUB but I have to steadfastly disagree . THE BREAKFAST CLUB was one of those productions that Hollywood used to churn out in the mid 1980s in order to sell a few records . SECRETS has an entirely different feel to it , in many ways it feels neither like a cynical marketing excersise nor a feature film but more like a theater play , and even though I haven't bothered to check I'm probably right in saying SECRETS started life off as a play . Check out the character of Randolf who starts off by speaking in a scouse accent then when he gets found out reverts to an Australian accent . This type of deliberate internal logic gaffe is not uncommon in stage plays since it gives actors the chance to show off a bit and of course the story is entirely low concept just like you'd expect from a stage play . This is a very uncinematic movie and the director seems to be lost in what to do with the characters . Check out the early scenes where Didi sits alone drawing . She's been down the basement with Danny but neither of them have said two words to one another . Very difficult to believe . But I guess the selling point to this movie is more to do with the music of The Beatles rather than character interaction but the music featured here is of the band's early stuff and I much prefer their later materialAs a strange footnote last year Paul McCartney's daughter Stella was married on the island of Bute where I live . We had some really big name celebs like Madonna and Gyneth Paltrow over for the wedding and the local population were totally star struck just like the characters in this film . Quite pathetic really
469709	1532177	113074	2.0	Was This Ever A HELLRAISER Sequel ?	Director of FIST OF THE NORTH STAR Tony Randel and screenwriter Peter Atkins were the two men who made HELLBOUND : HELLRAISER 2 . They were also the two men responsible for making that movie an incoherent mess , a good description of this movie too since I had no idea what this movie was supposed to be about or indeed where the plot was going and that was despite much voice over exposition . After seeing the movie I can't explain what on earth it is about I do have a sort of sneaky suspicion that Peter Atkins may have originally written FIST OF THE NORTH STAR as a HELLRAISER sequel . I can just imagine that there's been sort of disaster ( I'm not talking about the disaster that is this script ) where mankind has finally been defeated by the Cenobites and it's up to a mystical hero to confront Pinhead and save the wretched survivors of humanity from his evil clutches . That might have been a good plot , even if it wasn't it still would have been a plot of some description , there's no evidence that I can see that this movie has a plotAs a lot of other people on this page I noticed this pile of crap was marketed as " A martial arts action story " so right away I was expecting a Chuck Norris or Steven Segal type plot of people getting punched on the nose and falling down is a very violent manner but not even my own low expectations prepared me for the unconvincing manner of the fights where a whole torso changes shape due to the impact of the punch , and of course a bad guy with a gun watches his fellows getting killed in unarmed combat and never thinks of shooting the good guy . I also couldn't help noticing that despite being well buffed the hero is in some dire need of acting lessons , everytime he is called to give a pained expression it looks like he's having an orgasm I would have given FIST OF THE NORTH STAR but I awarded it an extra point because of the ironic dialogue such as when Malcolm Mcdowell says " I remember before my body died " I shouted out " I remember before your career died " and the scene where Chris Penn " shouts " let's kill someone " I shouted back " Let's start with the producer , the director , the screenwriter . . . " Oh and there's a scene where a character says " You're already dead " which led me to believe it's a line stolen from HELLBOUND reinforcing my suspicion that this was a HELLRAISER sequel at one point
469170	1532177	105428	2.0	Based On An Unpublished Stephen King Story . . . .	. . . . And after seeing this pile of crap you won't be surprised that it wasn't published ! ! ! ! SPOILERS ! ! ! ! This is a terrible movie by any standards but when I point out that it's one of the worst movies that has the name Stephen King in the credits you can start to imagine how bad it is . The movie starts of with two characters staring open mouthed at a scene of horror : " My god . What happened here ? " " I don't know but they sure hate cats " The camera pans to the outside of a house where hundreds of cats are strung up dead and mutilated . Boy this guy is right , someone does hate cats and with a deduction like that he should be a policeman . Oh wait a minute , he is a policeman and when a movie starts with a cop making an oh so obvious observation you just know you're going to be watching a bad movie The reason SLEEPWALKERS is bad is that it's very illogical and confused . We eventually find out the monsters of the title need the blood of virgins to survive . Would they not be better looking for a virgin in the mid west bible belt rather than an American coastal town ? Having said that at least we know of the monsters motives - That's the only thing we learn . We never learn how they're able to change shape or are able to make cars become invisible and this jars with the ending that seems to have been stolen from THE TERMINATOR . Monster mother walks around killing several cops with her bare hands or blowing them up via a police issue hand gun ( ! ) but if her monster breed is immune from police fire power then why do the creatures need the ability to change shape or become invisible ? The demise of the creatures is equally ill thought out as there killed by a mass attack of household cats . If they can be killed by cats then why did the monsters not kill all the cats that were lying around the garden ? There was a whole horde of moggies sitting around but the monsters never thought about killing them . I guess that's so the production team can come up with an ending . It was that they started the movie my complaint lies We're treated to several scenes where famous horror movie directors like John Landis , Clive Barker and even Stephen King make cameos . I think the reason for this is because whenever a struggling unknown actor read the script they instantly decided that no matter what , they weren't going to appear in a movie this bad so Stephen King had to phone up his horror buddies in order to fill out the cast . That's how bad SLEEPWALKERS is Unbelievable as it seems that wasn't the worst line in the movie . The worst line is - " That cat saved my life "
468849	1532177	105217	2.0	Very Unlikable	Oh dear , a thriller about a deranged man who kidnaps children . What's not to like ? Apart from the premise you mean ? Three other things1 ) Dream sequences - The film drowns in these sequences . Someone dreams they're being murdered and they wake it and discover it was all a bad dream . I was actually shocked that the ending didn't revolve around the cop out ending but that would have been just too obvious . It should also be pointed out that because of these sequences the narrative ends up confusing the audience . For example a couple commit adultery by having sex in a woods but they have sex for a ridiculous amount of time which led me to believe it was another dream . But it wasn't . At least I don't think it was . Oh I'm so confused 2 ) John Lithgow's performance - Oh dear . Remember Jon Voight in ANACONDA ? I think Voight based his performance on Lithgow's style in this movie3 ) Brian De Palma's direction - CARRIE was very memorable due to De Palma's slow motion photography , his tracking shots and characters talking without any dialogue being heard . However it seems that he's a one trick pony . Nearly all his films contain this idiosyncratic technique , THE FURY contained it as did DRESSED TO KILL and THE UNTOUCHABLES and CASUALTIES OF WAR was almost ruined by it and here it's totally unnecessary . I should also point out that a pram features in the climax like it did in THE UNTOUCHABLES . Time to move onto some other directing style Mr De Palma
469411	1532177	256155	2.0	The Horror	To say this is a JAWS rip off does not do justice as to how bad this is , in fact the only compatant bits are the monster P . O . V shots stolen from the JAWS franchise . This is film making at its absolute nadir , it'd be impossible to make a film worse than this on purpose . Everyone has already commented the mistakes like the American ambulances and the god awful ( Non ) Scottish accents , the poor acting etc , but has anyone mentioned the goof that dynamite ISN'T freely avalaible in Scotland ? Or that the police uniforms aren't the same ones seen in Scotland ? And has anyone pointed out how poor the dialogue is ? " A lotta people want you out of here " Aye Scottish film goers obviously " You not wanted round here here " Aye definately scottish film goers " I'm really sorry for what happened " No doubt said by everyone involved in the making of this tripe " I could do better with a ( A high St brand of camera ) " No doubt said by everyone who's seen this tripe . Also notice the product placement . So that's how this film was funded " We need something that'll keep us in work " Subtle post modernist excuse for making this tripe " We don't need any help round here " Oh no ? What about acting lessons , screenwriting classes , film school etc ? " Why don't you go back to the States to find bigfoot or Elvis Pressley ? " Maybe they could also find a decent script , director , editor , producer and actors while they're there " Sheep got a headache ? " Oh right like the Welsh , Aussies and New Zealanders the Jocks are sheep lovers are they ? Doubt if anyone in this film would have the guts to say that in Scotland especially after watching this tripe it's obvious they have no idea where ScotlandPS A flock of sheep with headaches could have made a better film than this
469325	1532177	106453	2.0	One Of The Worst Courtroom Dramas Ever Made	If you're still unsure that Hollywood execs have no creative ideas then get yourself a time machine and go back to the early to mid 1990s to a time when nearly every studio release was composed of a " person from hell movie 2 be they a doctor , a cop , a flatmate , a jilted lover etc who would terrorize an innocent or not so innocent victim . When cinema goers weren't putting with that crap we also had to put up with BASIC INSTINCT clones . BODY OF EVIDENCE was probably the most infamous clone mainly down to the fact that it's both unoriginal and painfully bad . The worst aspect is the script which lacks any type of sense or logic or decent dialogue . Yeah the lines are memorable all right but for the wrong reasons . Take this line of dialogue for example : " Have you ever watched animals making love ? " Does anyone else feel their mind boggle at such a ridiculous comment ? Animals making love ? Is that why there's so many insects in the world - They're the most romantic creatures on Earth ? Madonna is one of the great female icons of the 20th century but she is no actress . Madonna's performance is the second worst aspect of the movie . It's so bad that other well respected actors like Archer , Moore , Defoe and Prochnow sink to her levelSimply one of the worst courtroom dramas ever made
469323	1532177	339789	2.0	Techno-Babble	I can't remember much about this TVM except for the fact I hated it . This was down to two things 1 ) The techno-babble . In order to fool the audience into thinking they're watching a high brow sci-fi movie the writer has introduced reams and reams of big words in the dialogue and there's no way I can quote it because I've no idea how the spell the words . It doesn't matter if they're real scientific expressions or just made up because the audience will be totally confused either way2 ) The gore is rasther off putting . You see being a TVM I was expecting a PG certificate but we see things like killer moths from outer space burrowing out of peoples ' limbs . Yuck
468521	1532177	48474	2.0	Not Worth Watching	Is there anyone else out there fascinated by the octopus ? Strange creatures they are , almost like something out of a sci-fi comic book with their giant heads and their tentacles grabbing anything that looks good enough to eat . Did you know the female octopus dies after laying her eggs , her contribution to the species has passed at this point . Fascinating . So when I heard the climax of PEARL OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC involved a giant octopus I eagerly sat down to watch this movie . Big mistake because sitting through this is an ordeal . It's poorly acted with a cast who look like they're going to burst into song at any minute , pitifully written with atrocious dialogue ( " I feel like I just swallowed an octopus " Gee don't get too ironic ) in a movie that can best be described as HEART OF DARKNESS lite . If I have anything good about this film it's that the battle with the giant octopus is very well done , much better than say the giant squid from REAP THE WILD WIND and that the battle takes place about two thirds of the way through which means you've already seen the best bit and can turn off without having to endure another 30 minutes of crap
470142	1532177	110632	2.0	" Why Are They Making Fin ' Stupid Movies " . . .	. . . asks Woody Harrelson's character Mickey and was the one and only time in the movie I found myself agreeing with him . Not that NATURAL BORN KILLERS is a stupid movie - It's worse than a stupid movie , it's an egotistical one as Oliver Stone shows through one movie how many directing styles he learned at film school . It goes without saying that as a director he fails with this , the only exceptions being " The Mallory home life sit com " and the title sequence that features a pumping soundtrack , but it's saying something when the impact of the film is down more to a Patti Smith track than the director . Oh and can anyone explain any contextual reasons for all the differing styles ? For a film that claims to be a satire the script lacks any type of intelligence , wit , or even satire , a problem I would have thought in a satirical film . The script can best be described as " BONNIE AND CLYDE on acid " which probably suits the " MTV on cocaine " type of directing . What's the subtext ? Everyone has the capacity to be a killer ? Yeah like I've never seen an edition of the news or seen quiet guys - Girls too - go violently mad after a few drinks . Yeah I managed to work out man is a noble savage devoid of nobility and that was before I saw this OTT crap . There also seems to be a bit of a flaw to the structure , you know that oft shown clip of people around the world praising Mickey and Mallory ? I was totally convinced before seeing NBK this scene would take place at the very end of the movie ( Logically it should ) but it takes place roughly 25 minutes into the running timeAs for the controversy the only death NATURAL BORN KILLERS was responsible for was killing Oliver Stone's career , but he's only got himself to blame
469342	1532177	475683	2.0	Totally Immoral	Paul Cunningham is a man who is in serious trouble because he owes a bookie money who is perhaps not the sort of person who will go through the courts to get his money back . Paul has till the end of next week to pay back £1800 or else . On his way home he witnesses a homeless man being beaten up ! ! ! ! SPOILERS ! ! ! ! I don't care if I'm upsetting anyone who reads this but I absolutely hated Jamie Palmer's short film PAUL'S LUCKY DAY . It gives immorality a bad name . Paul takes a homeless man , a victim of a mugging back to his flat and when he finds out he has the winning numbers on a lottery ticket he suffocates him . There you go , we're asked to empathise with a murderer , we're asked to feel happy that a murderer has won the lottery , I don't think so . There's also a massive plot hole involved here because if you suffocate someone with a pillow this will show up in a post Morten . Considering the homeless man has died in very suspicious circumstances a post morten would be compulsory and yet the pathologist hasn't noticed the cause of death Morality - Or rather the lack of it - aside , PAUL'S LUCKY DAY is something of a failure on the technical side . This short is filmed in murky monochrome which isn't pleasing to the eye but it's the sound mix which is the major irritant since I could hardly make out a bloody word that was being spoken Paul might have been lucky . I doubt if anyone watching this will feel the same way
469902	1532177	167150	3.0	Even By Roberts Standards This Is Poor	Oh dear , a week after reviewing STILETTO DANCE I said I thought Eric Roberts deserved better films then along comes RESTRAINING ORDER which made me think he deserves all he gets POSSIBLE SPOILERS On the surface this film may sound similar to I CONFESS or ABSOLUTION but whatever potential intelligence that may have been found within the premise is soon forgotten as the film becomes more and more dumb . In fact it becomes downright offensive in the way it treats its audience . A good example is the bit where the plot revolves around a video recording which is seen to be destroyed , then without any explanation whatsoever another video recording suddenly comes into possesion of the hero ! What , he made another recording ? Why wasn't this mentioned on screen ? Or the bit where a character puts the silencer on a gun meaning he must be a villain about to commit murder - but then it's revealed he's a good guy who saves the hero's wife . In that case why did he need a silencer ? So you see there's no type of internal logic in this movie . Note to Eric Roberts : Can you change both your agent and hairdresser please ? Note to Tatjana Patitz : Stick to modeling because you're no actress
469233	1532177	179443	3.0	It's Rancid Alright	This is a film that had a lot to live down to . on the year of its release legendary film critic Barry Norman considered it the worst film of the year and I'd heard nothing but bad things about it especially a plot that was criticised for being too complicated To be honest the plot is something of a red herring and the film suffers even more when the word " plot " is used because as far as I can see there is no plot as such . There's something involving Russian gangsters , a character called Pete Thompson who's trying to get his wife Sarah pregnant , and an Irish bloke called Sean . How they all fit into something called a " plot " I'm not sure . It's difficult to explain the plots of Guy Ritchie films but if you watch any of his films I'm sure we can all agree that they all posses one no matter how complicated they may seem on first viewing . Likewise a James Bond film though the plots are stretched out with action scenes . You will have a serious problem believing RANCID ALUMINIUM has any type of central plot that can be cogently explained Taking a look at the cast list will ring enough warning bells as to what sort of film you'll be watching . Sadie Frost has appeared in some of the worst British films made in the last 15 years and she's doing nothing to become inconsistent . Steven Berkoff gives acting a bad name ( and he plays a character called Kant which sums up the wit of this movie ) while one of the supporting characters is played by a TV presenter presumably because no serious actress would be seen dead in this The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it's utterly forgettable . I saw it a few days ago and immediately after watching I was going to write a very long a critical review warning people what they are letting themselves in for by watching , but by now I've mainly forgotten why . But this doesn't alter the fact that I remember disliking this piece of crap immensely
470230	1532177	113540	3.0	More Controversy For Controversy's Sake	Larry Clark might think he's made a movie that will get people all over the world talking . It got me talking . It made me say " More controversy for the sake of it " YAAAAWWWNNN . But to be fair to Clark there's no such thing as bad publicity so any movie that sickens an audience with AIDS , rape , drug taking and violence all involving characters in their early teens can only be a good thing . Right Larry ? Clark might also think he's making a naturalistic movie by using a cast of total unknowns many of whom have no acting experience but the performances aren't natural - They're simply awful . Look at Leo Fitzpatrick who plays Telly , have you ever seen a more irritating performance ? Fitzpatrick does deserve some faint praise since he's the most outstanding non actor in a movie overwhelmed by outstanding non actors I have tried to appreciate Clark's later works like TEENAGE CAVEMAN but this director always goes out of his way to shock his audience usually with 15 years old saying " I want to fck you so much baby " and then getting down to the dirty deed while taking drugs . This very quickly becomes puerile and unworthy of discussion . How about making a movie with a plot and no sex Larry ? Or is that beyond your talents ?
468617	1532177	74881	3.0	Seen It All Before	I can imagine the pitch at the TV execs office went something like this " You know what everyone watches at the cinema these days ? Disaster movies , so let's get everyone out of the cinema back into the home with a disaster movie for TV " " Great idea . We'll get a well known TV actor and some Oscar winning actor everyone has forgotten about . How we gonna come up with a new slant on the genre ? " " that's easy we set it on a plane just like in AIRPORT except , except there's a mad psycho killer aboard the plane . We could even get that crazy guy from EARTHQUAKE to play the psycho " " With an idea and casting like that that there's no way we can fail with this TV movie " I beg to differ because as someone who's seen MAYDAY AT 40 , 000 FEET it is a failure because someone forgot to write an interesting script
469181	1532177	131352	3.0	If This Isn't Unoriginal I Don't Know What Is	" Something is missing " whines John Larkin . I quite agree , an original script is missing , not to mention a big name star , a director who has made more than just TVMs , and a big budget . For the first ten minute of the film - oooopps sorry I mean TVM . There is a difference - the plot involves an everyman type suffering from strange dreams , finds his wife and lifestyle are not what they seem and discovers himself to be a hunted man . At any second I was expecting the line " If I'm not me then who the hell am I ? " to come out . Guess what film I'm referring to ? Sorry but Timothy Hutton isn't big Arnie or Jean Claude Van Damme , but he's not Steven Segal either so I guess DEAD BY MIDNIGHT could be worse and it does contain a mind blowing scene where the bad guy turns up at an orphanage and gives the long suffering TV viewer a good laugh with some of the worst acting I have ever seen
470209	1532177	120834	3.0	I Almost Fell Asleep	An American man is found dead and the question is was he murdered by a white man or was his death an accident ? But maybe a better question would been how can anyone make such a dire film ? Okay dire is maybe too strong a word but SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS is a very boring film badly structured . The victim's body is found then the action ( I use the word action in in its loosest sense ) cuts to the trial , then cuts back to a character more than 20 years ago , then moves forward to 9 years ago during the second world war . What this all means is we're not introduced to the characters properly which makes for a very uninvolving film . It also leaves me at a loss as to what genre the film falls into , it's not a court room drama , or a romance , or a war film . What is it then ? A good cure for insomnia I guess
468979	1532177	131646	3.0	I've Never Played The Game But . . .	. . . I imagine it must be a hundred times more entertaining than this sorry excuse of a movie and I make no apologies for pointing out what a terrible piece of film making it is . An alien invasion force launches an attack on the human race and proceeds towards planet Earth and it's up to some fighter pilots to stop them . Well hope the defenders put far more effort into stopping them than the producers put effort into making this movie - It's really awful . I mean what's the point of hiring such talented actors as Suchet , Prochnow and Warner if you're going to give them a zero dimensional character and stilted lines ? having said that the decent cast members still give a performance good enough to show that the rest of the cast like Burrows and Prinze Jr are pretty rank . Yeah okay maybe it's not a film that an audience are going to watch for the cast but I imagine the original video game had much better FX and graphics as seen here . Words fail to describe how painfully bad the technical attributes of this movie are . When I say THE MUMMY RETURNS had better CGI that says everything you will ever need to know about WING COMMANDER
468545	1532177	120915	3.0	The Farcical Menace More Like	Never been a STAR WARS fan and I fail to see what the fuss was about with the original trilogy , but I'm shocked as to how even the most die hard fan could have enjoyed this movie . In fact I'll be even more blunt - I'm surprised as to how the film company allowed George Lucas to release this movie ! First of all there's absolutely no coherance to the script . The first 25 minutes are composed of characters escaping from CGI monsters only to be confronted by other CGI monsters ( Is this why it's called THE PHANTOM MENACE ? ) then some vague mention of trade wars then it's back onto the FX again . Not that the FX are up to much even the explosions are obviously done by CGI , no technical triumphs here . And the other technical aspects are very poor especially the editing . Has everyone failed to notice the tme discrepancys between scenes ? We see one character captured by war droids then it cuts to another scene which seems to last several minutes then it cuts back to the war droid scene where it seems no time has passed at all . THE PHANTOM MENACE is full of this haphazard editing which leads me to believe it wasn't edited at all . But the two things that really got my goat were the war driods and the acting . First of all the war driods are complete wimps ( And yes they are CGI ) I mean we have about three dozen droids armed with lazer guns trying to kill a couple of Jedi knights armed with light sabres . Guess who wins ? Correct . This lack of a credible enemy undermines an already poor film where we know that our heros will never be in serious danger now matter how many driods they come up against . A few people have made similar complaints about FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS , but the enemy in FELLOWSHIP have identical weapons whereas here the good guys are heavily outgunned as well as being heavily outnumbered and it's laughable to watch a small handfull of people waving their light sabres against hundreds of well armed droids . Secondly the acting . We can sit here and discuss what " Bad " acting is . For me the worst type of acting is wooden acting . Gasp in amazement as a host of well regarded stars read their lines as if they're reading out a shopping list . Neeson is wooden , Jackson and Stamp make no impact but worst of all is Portman whose performance is so bad it has to be seen to be believed and which left me scratching my head puzzled as to why she got payed for her performance . The only two performances that stuck out was Frank Oz and Ewan McGregor and even then that's down to his implaceble irritating accent . And before anyone accuses me of not liking the fantasy genre I will say I absolutely loved FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and will be booking my ticket to see THE TWO TOWERS when its released . New Line Cinema know a masterpiece when they fund one
468757	1532177	110419	3.0	Some People Might Like It	This starts with Angus MacGyver and his old college professor Fat Shouting Actor Atticus going on a little jaunt to the Balkans to pick up some artifacts . You think being educated men Angus and Atticus would have picked up the artifacts before or after everyone in the region started killing one another but if they did that we wouldn't have a story . Strangely enough the first act is completely disposable and seems to exist only as a social conscience so we can hear MacGyver spouting lines like " mYou're committing ethnic cleansing , racial genocide " . Perhaps the worst thing about this is that you find yourself questioning if this is the right platform for people to be making these kind of speeches , I mean MACGYVER is supposed to be a fun show so should it be concerning itself with real life geo-political issues ? I mean in THE A TEAM no one came out with " The Republicans are obesessed with neo liberal market forces , so by helping ourselves we're not doing anything Reagan isn't doing " . You also can't help noticing that " The Balkans look suspiciously like Battersea Power Station in London . Guess where this sequence was filmed ? After being hit over the head as to why ethnic cleansing and racial genocide are bad things MacGyver and Atticus depart " The Balkans " and go to London ( Ha Ha Ha But they've been in London the whole time - I meant another part of London ) where the plot is explained and Angus and Atticus embark on an adventure to an exotic location - Actually a quarry . A lot of people describe this TVM as an Indiana Jones rip off but it's more in keeping with DOCTOR WHO since no matter where in the universe the characters go it always ends up looking like a few minutes drive from London Fans of MACGYVER might like this feature length adventure ( Most probably the 100 or so people who worked on it and gave on this site ) but I didn't
469430	1532177	66958	3.0	Don't Know About Terror But It Is Terrible	A cheaply made British film from the early 1970s is what CRUCIBLE OF TERROR is , but you'll never believe how bad it is untill you actually watch it . The plot is just basically a whodunnit where it's so obvious that you know straight from the first murder who's behind the killings , except at the very end there's a plot twist that will have you reeling and not in a good way either . It's as though the producer realised how obvious the killer was that he instructed the screenwriter to forgo any credibility to make ( You'll never guess who ) the murderer at the very last minute . The other thing that had me reeling was the performance of Mike Raven who struck me as a cross between Roger Delgado ( The original master from Doctor Who ) and Christopher Lee . It's not too difficult to believe that Mr Raven disappeared from the acting world after making this crazy movie
469438	1532177	120531	3.0	Dire Ethnic Sex Comedy With little Redeeming Features	The premise of WOO centers around a mismatched couple who meet via a blind date . The eponymous Woo turns up at the flat of Tim who is a bit of nerd and a complete contrast to Woo . Right away you realise that this isn't a groundbreaking sex comedy and perhaps needed something to set it apart from other movies in the sub genre and there's nothing here that does But what really ruins the film is the ethnic stereotypes and I don't think I've seen so many unlikely characters since watching black exploitation movies like SHAFT and Hit-man . The audience are really smacked over the head as to just how funky these black people are which will probably cause offence to black people and white liberals and will certainly irritate everyone else , so from having a movie that from the outset would merely have been very run of the mill we have a movie that is embarrassing . If you're going to populate a film with black people at least give them non stereotypical quirks
468674	1532177	110695	3.0	No Reason To Watch	Oh a vaguely once famous actress in a film where she plays a mother to a child . It's being shown on BBC 1 at half past midnight , I wonder if . . . yup it's a TVM You've got to hand it to TVM producers , not content on making one mediocre movie , they usually give us two mediocre movies where two themes are mixed together and NOWHERE TO HIDE is no different . The first theme is a woman in danger theme cross pollinated with a woman suffering from the pain of a divorce theme which means we have a scene of the heroine surviving a murder attempt followed by a scene having her son Sam ask why she divorced ? And being a TVM she answers that the reason is " That people change " rather than say something along the lines like " I'm a right slapper " or Your daddy cruises mens public toilets for sex " as does happen in real life divorce cases . And it's young Sam I feel sorry for , not only are his parents divorced but he's as thick as two short planks . Actually since he's so stupid he deserves no sympathy because he's unaware that a man flushing stuff down a toilet is a drug dealer , unaware that you might die if someone shoots at you , and unaware that I LOVE LUCY is painfully unfunny . If only our own childhoods were so innocent , ah well as Orwell said " Ignorance is strength " . Oh hold on Sam is suddenly an expert on marine life ! Is this character development or poor scripting ? I know what one my money's on . And strange that Sam the boy genuis hasn't noticed that if the story is set in 1994 then why do people often wear clothes , drive cars and ride trains from the 1950s ? But as it turns out during a plot twist it's the mother who's the dummy . Then there's a final plot twist that left me feeling like an idiot for watching this
469676	1532177	65184	4.0	Not Much Of A Tribute	Peter Ustinov died a few days ago and is traditional with stars dying the BBC showed a film as a hasty tribute , and what film did we get as a tribute ? SPARTACUS where Ustinov gives a show stopping performance as a slave trader ? Nope . Another Oscar performance this time from TOKAPI ? Nope . What about ASHANTI ? , it's a film a lot of critics can't stand but Ustinov's politically incorrect performance had me in stiches . No can do . The film we got was VIVA MAX a slap stick comedy that seems a bit of a slap in the face as far as tributes go Ustinov plays the title character of Max very well but to be honest VIVA MAX isn't much of a comedy . It might be politically incorrect but it's also very unsophisticated . The Mexicans decide to recapture the Alamo . Let's be honest , does that sound like there's going to be a lot of milage in this premise ? You're right there isn't so we're treated to scenes featuring silly Mexican soldiers fighting off silly American soldiers with fire hoses and exchanges of dialogue along the lines of " Drop your weapons - No you drop your weapons - No you drop your weapons - No you drop your weapons " and it's all done with the subtlety of THE BLUES BROTHERS another film where I didn't start laughing
469354	1532177	83511	4.0	A Buddy Movie	Buddy movies were very popular in the 1980s , less popular in the 1990s and non existent at the turn of the century . I think the reason they're non existent these days is that it's a genre that is very , very limited as anyone who has seen more than a very small handful of buddy movies can testify . It all comes down having a hard boiled cop matched up with a contrasting character and there you have it 48 HOURS is better than most simply down to the fact that it was a fairly original idea at the time and where the movie works best is with the violent thriller element . Some of the violence is quite shocking down to the fact that it's so cold blooded . Take the " Nice gun " scene which is an uneasy scene to watch down to the cold calculating way the violence is dispensed . A murder scene doesn't have to gory for it to be disturbing , something that I hope directors will take note of Where the film is less successful is when it's trying to be amusing . I do confess I've always disliked Eddie Murphy down to the fact that he always seems to play the same wise cracking urbane black dude in every movie he's appeared in and here he's every bit as irritating as every movie he's been in . Oh and did I spot a blunder where Murphy and Nolte's characters are introduced at the prison cell block ? Nolte's cop asks Murphy's con to help him find a fugitive - Right in front of a crowded prison wing and Murphy agrees ! I was under the impression that if anyone did that in real life they'd get capped by the inmates before they left the gates . Failing that they'd be watching their back for the rest of their life on the outside , no one likes a prison stoolie How much you enjoy 48 HOURS comes down to how much you enjoy buddy movies . I enjoyed it in parts but as some people have already pointed out you can get too much of a good thing
470067	1532177	485617	4.0	Tonight Matthew I Shall Be Ripping Off Famous Thrillers	This was well publicised due to the fact it featured STARS IN THEIR EYES presenter Matthew Kelly in a straight acting role as a convicted serial killer . No don't laugh , Mr Kelly has appeared in several sitcoms and spends Christmas time acting in family pantomimes and I hear he's very good at playing Captain Hook in PETER PAN down by the seaside . You think he's a camp TV presenter ? Oh no he isn't It's Kelly's role that's the most talked about aspect to this TV drama and one can't thinking it's talked about for the wrong reasons . Clean shaven and bespectacled Kelly plays Brian Wicklow a serial killer sentenced to the rest of his life in prison . Alas Wicklow resembles Timothy Lumbsden from BBC sitcom SORRY rather than a cold blooded killer and this makes the story unintentionally laughable . The other convicts aren't exactly terrified by him either and they break wind in his general direction . I was expecting the insult of " Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberry " to be hurled at Wicklow . Oh and Wicklow takes hissy fits at the other prisoners . I defy you to watch this without tears running down your legs No doubt the producers were hoping COLD BLOOD was going to be a disturbing and haunting adult thriller but instead of coming up with ideas of their own they ripped off other superior thrillers , I mean the plot line involves things we've already seen before in MESSIAH ( he's not the messiah he's a very naughty boy ) , CRACKER and most obvious of all SILENCE OF THE LAMBS where the cops delve into the mind of Wicklow to find out how a serial killer acts ( Hopefully better than anyone else in this production - That shouldn't be too difficult ) which leads me to ask if we'll ever see Sir Anthony Hopkins presenting a TV talent show where the contestants dress up as their favourite pop star and belt out their hits ? I should hope not
469388	1532177	175771	4.0	I Guess It Could Have Been Good	INFERNO starts off with a fairly impressive for a TVM starscape effect . We're also introduced to a scientist who's called Heller . Don't you get it ? Heller , Hell-er , Inferno . So I guess someone on the production had some intelligence . However it does become more and more obvious as the TVM progresses that intelligence has been discarded throughout the storyline in order to appeal to an American TVM audience The story itself is overwhelmed by subplots featuring umpteen stock TVM characters like the tough liberal schoolteacher who's trying to save a home boy from a life of crime , the doctor who's lost his medical licence etc . In fact the story concentrates far more on these characters than the approaching disaster that all the potential tension and drama the scenario might have had soon goes up in a puff of smoke , and being a TVM we just know that there won't be a downbeat ending There is an onscreen problem I noticed and that is everytime there's an explosion there's a massive fireball which looks ridiculous not to mention physically impossible . Look at the scene where the national guard are in a fight with a gang . A soldier fires a grenade into a tower block and the whole building explodes in a fire ball . What a small greanade containing no more than a few ounces of high explosive can do that ! No it can't . There's also another scene of army engineers blowing up a dam with plastic explosive and the same fireball effect is seen . Can directors please note that high explosive is not the same as napalm Having said that I did find INFERNO highly watchable for a TVM and at no time did I find myself wanting to turn it off . It did have some potential and let me repeat the special effects are fairly good considering the budget and it's not as bad a TVM as some people are making out
469892	1532177	117774	4.0	Very Silly	Anyone remember Tom Berenger ? He was quite a prolific actor in the late 1980s fresh from his success as the bad guy in PLATOON , and was in my humble opinion one of the more convincing tough actors of that era , but for some inexplicable reason soon find himself starring in more and more low budget , low quality projects . Worse he now finds himself playing supporting roles in low budget , low quality straight to video projectsTHE SUBSTITUTE was made when Berenger's career was in free fall and as you'd expect it's hardly impressive material . Some of my disappointment might be down to how the story plays out , seeing as it's about a former merc becoming a teacher in an inner city ghetto school in Miami I was expecting something along the lines of DANGEROUS MINDS , but this movie plays out totally different . In many ways it's like a revenge thriller produced by Cannon from the 1980s with some absolutely ridiculous plot twists and bizarre scenes which is unforgivable because THE SUBSTITUTE is a good film in parts , namely when Mr Smith talks about his experiences in ' Nam . This would have worked far , far better as a drama rather than a thriller
468891	1532177	78350	4.0	A Guilty Pleasure	Yeah fair enough , this is reckoned to be the worst disaster movie ever . Agreed there's some really terrible acting involved with Michael Caine either OTT or totally wooden from scene to scene with the kid playing Paul giving a " I'm really terrified because I'm waving my head from side to side and saying no , no , no an awful lot " acting style . That said I do have a soft spot for THE SWARM because it is rather enjoyable due to the lapses in logic and science , and who can fail to be emoured by the laughable dialogue like " We've been losing the war against the insects for 15 years but I'd never thought it'd be the bees - They've always been our friends " or " Has this nuclear power plant made any provisions against killer bees " ? Don't take it so seriously and you might just enjoy it
468402	1532177	104779	4.0	Man Brags About Sex Life	This story is about an English couple , Nigel and Fiona Dobson on a cruise ship where they meet a crippled American called Oscar who tells them of his relationship with the love of his life a young French woman called Mimi Is there anything less compelling than someone discussing their sex life ? I know a lot of people detest having to look at their friends holiday picture snaps but having to listen to other peoples sex lives really take the biscuit and who thought this would have been a good idea for a movie ? I guess since the director is Polanski many people watched this for voyeuristic reasons to see if it explains Polanski's psyche but it's a fairly dire uninvolving movie with unsympathetic characters , I mean we've got Mimi who is what the Brits would call " A bit of a slapper " going out with someone old enough to be her father . Did I mention Roman Polanski is the director ? And after losing Mimi Oscar decides to seduce women he meets at the supermarket . Did I mention the characters are unsympathetic ? Oh and Oscar gets back with Mimi after he's been crippled and she embarks on an affair with a dancer . Did I mention she's a bit of a slapper ? The ending is rather depressing and as the credits roll you feel that the movie has been a waste of time
470100	1532177	47376	4.0	Rather Simple Story With Effective Moments	THE PURPLE PLAIN is a British war film which means it's rather understated when compared to its American counterparts . There's not a massive budget involved which means little in the way of spectacle and if truth be told the special effects involving a RAF fighter-bomber coming under attack from Japanese flak is somewhat unconvincing . It also contains a few too many stiff upper lipped chaps I do give credit to the movie for bringing some type of psycological thought to the story though . The movie revolves around Canadian RAF pilot Squadron Leader Bill Forrester who is a suprisingly complex character for this type of movie . Forrester is a man who knows what grief is and it threatens to tear him apart . However the complexities and characteristics of Forrester soon become pushed into the background as the story concentrates on the adventure antics of the hero trying to escape from behind enemy linesTHE PURPLE PLAIN isn't a movie that's dated well . No doubt when it was released in the mid 1950s audiences ( Especially those who crewed an aircraft or fought in the Far East ) could relate to it more but it seems slightly cliched now . But like I said it does try to be a character study instead of a straight forward war movie and it does contain some effective moments
470000	1532177	117628	4.0	Not One I'd Watch	Some people have criticised the way this film is directed but my own complaint is the way it's produced and it's probably not a valid complaint because it's produced unreservedly for a female audience , though strangely enough male voters on this site have awarded it a slightly higher mark than females Apart from being the kind of movie that twenty something females can get together and watch on a Friday night with a bottle of wine it's difficult to understand the thinking behind it . Is it a star vehicle for Jennifer Aniston and Cameron Diaz ? If so why put two up and coming actresses in the same movie because they cancel each other out and Diaz role as Heather does seem slightly underwritten . In this type of movie people in general and men in particular never really act as they would in real life and while I'm not a fan of " social realism " in movies neither am I a fan of romantic comedies / chick flicks either Not to be to negative I did smile at at the line : " She looks like she came from an island " " Yeah Rhode Island "
469228	1532177	87032	4.0	Very Dumb	Despite being a very silly film I did think the original CANNONBALL RUN did have several amusing moments . Unfortunately this sequel takes all the bad points of the original and modifies aspects of its own that make it a far lesser film One aspect is the whole feel of the movie . The original was produced as a straightforward road movie similar to THE GUMBALL RALLY whilst here we see post referential lines and parodies of other movies like THE GODFATHER and SOME LIKE IT HOT which makes it resemble something more akin to HOT SHOTS and Repossessed while still retaining bits that are almost identical to the first one . For instance did we really need another set piece battle involving Jackie Chan and a bunch of bikers ? CANNONBALL RUN 2 does have a very funny scene where a bogus nun whispers into Dean Martin's ear who gives a shocked expression . He turns to Sammy Davis Jnr and whispers what was said . Sammy's jaw drops . " You are sick " . I genuinely thought that was amusing . Oh and we get the final silver screen appearance of old blue eyes though strangely I couldn't help thinking that someone edited this via another film . Perhaps Joe Pesci might consider that this wasn't a fitting swan song for Sinatra and he might do another film after LETHAL WEAPON 4 , certainly Sinatra deserved better as his last cinema role
470220	1532177	71569	4.0	Probably Harryhausen's Least Impressive Effort	Ray Harryhausen is a special FX god who knocks todays CGI wizards into a corked hat . Compare the skeleton scenes of JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS with many of today's movies and tell me what effect is more convincing ? No contest is it ? Unfortunately the problem with THE GOLDEN VOYAGE OF SINBAD is that the audience is sitting there waiting for some great stop frame animation to come along and the film drags its feet in this respect . Twenty five minutes into the running time and there's only one small sequence featuring the Harryhausen effect , instead the audience have to put up with a bunch of not unknown British television actors standing around talking . The stop frame animation sequences do eventually come but how many children would have been bored senseless by this time ? Watching THE GOLDEN VOYAGE OF SINBAD today is of interest for only two reasons . One is that the heroes are obviously Muslim which you probably won't be seeing in too many movies these days while the other is that the producer of DOCTOR WHO at the time Barry Letts decided to cast Tom baker in the title role after seeing him in this movie
468406	1532177	94208	4.0	Plot less Love Story	For the life of me I have no idea what type of movie director Diane Kurys was trying to make here . It centres around the relationship between American director Steve Elliot and English actress Jane Steiner . It contains long - Too long - scenes of romantic European cities with romantic music in the background but at the same time is possibly too explicit to be a simple love story . For example Steve gets Jane to tell him an erotic lesbian fantasy " I can feel her lips on my nipples as I rub my hand between her legs . . . " and there's some nudity . But the problem with MAN IN LOVE is that there's zero plot . Okay I wasn't expecting car chases or Bruce Willis crashing through windows but the story ends up going nowhere . In many ways it's like a meaningless Mills & Boon story that might strike a cord with women who have just experienced a holiday romance . No doubt French film students will think this some sort of romantic masterwork but I didn't care for it apart from the lesbian fantasy monologue
469541	1532177	120912	4.0	Instantly Forgettable	! ! ! ! ! MILD SPOILERS ! ! ! ! ! ! I saw MIB 2 a couple of hours ago and it wasn't untill I typed this review that I suddenly realised I can hardly remember a thing about it ! Now let's see I remember special effects . . . . . well CGI which is so common nowadays I'm not sure if it's classed as a special effect anymore . Oh and the usually impressive Tommy Lee Jones is in it , but he doesn't actually appear until the mid way point of the film and this leads to a subplot with Agent K teaching Agent J what M . I . B operations involve . Oh yes those cute worm guys are in it just like in the first film , oh and so's that guy who can grow a new head . Ah I'm starting to remember what's wrong with this sequel - it's very very similar to the original . In fact it covers very little new ground which is okay if you loved the first MEN IN BLACK film but I didn't , I found it typical Hollywood Summer blockbuster FX laden fare . And I found the sequel worse in this respect
468559	1532177	75845	4.0	What Went Wrong ?	On paper this should have been excellent . We have Robert Aldrich who made some very intelligent , cynical movies like ATTACK , THE DIRTY DOZEN , TOO LATE THE HERO and ULZANA'S RAID directing a novel by acclaimed author Joseph Wambaugh and featuring amongst others notable actors like Louis Gosset Jnr and James Woods before they became well known . But since it was made on celluloid and not on paper that doesn't appear to count for very much THE CHOIRBOYS is a mess . There's little plot to speak off and is so cluttered up with characters that it's impossible to understand where the screenplay is going and of the characters themselves they're very unlikable . Since the characters are amoral policeman I thought perhaps someone had the idea of making this as a precursor to HILL STREET BLUES and I guess somewhere along the line that's what the intention was , of an off beat black comedy but the writing , directing and acting is so heavy handed it's like watching a very bad adult version of POLICE ACADEMY with only the sequence of a man taking his pink poodle in the park coming close to raising a smile Did I start this review by asking what went wrong ? After seeing the movie in its entirety I feel I now have to ask did anything go right ?
469069	1532177	63035	4.0	Interesting In One Aspect	Lets not kid ourselves , Big John Wayne didn't do this as a war film he did it as a western . Look at the actors here they're far too old to be elite combat troops , they're all Victor McLaglen wannabees but without the talent . If they'd cast totem poles they wouldn't have been as wooden as this cast . The dialogue is straight out of a very bad B western - " That packs our pistol " - and the battle scenes are a parody of an indian attack . Watch the scene where the injuns are attacking the fort , oopps sorry I mean where the VC are overrunning the American base , Injun music suddenly appears on the soundtrack as the VC raise the North Vietnamese flag . When someone told big John the VC were reds he must have thought they were redskins . You got a better explanation ? Despite this atrocity of film making THE GREEN BERETS does have one bizarre aspect that makes it compelling . George Beckworth undergoes a character arc . 10 years later we'd see the same type of formula character arc take place in THE DEER HUNTER , PLATOON etc . The important difference here is that Beckworth starts off as a liberal opposed to American intervention but ends up being so pro war he mans a mortar team . Compare this to the story narrative of APOCALYPSE NOW . No doubt Colonel Kilgore went on to become a peace campaigner and flower arranger
470228	1532177	85636	4.0	Not Really A Nigel Kneale Script	I knew the studio politics before I saw SEASON OF THE WITCH . That is I knew that the producers had decided to release a film every year under the Halloween banner that had absolutely zero to do with Michael Myers so there was no disappointment on my part that this wasn't a stalk and slash sequel . What disappointed me was the credits reading " Written by Tommy Lee Wallace " when I knew fine well who wrote the screenplay . However after seeing the movie I could see that Kneale's contribution had been diluted to death and that's why he wanted his name removed ! ! ! ! ! ! ! MILD SPOILERS ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! It's easy to see what parts of the plot belong firmly to Kneale , namely the central story of Stonehenge being used to destroy the children of America ( Similar to QUATERMASS ) and of a sinister factory being used for a covert invasion ( Similar to QUATERMASS 2 ) along with concepts welding the supernatural and science together . Unfortunately the rest of the script lacks Kneale's strength of painting strong characters and making memorable dialogue . Worse the script shows signs of being so written to death someone has forgotten to explain why the bad guy is planning to kill all the children on Halloween , or at least that's how it seems on first glance The producers deserve some credit on trying to do something different to a movie franchise , but it's obviously a failed experiment . If only they'd let Nigel Kneale do his own thing
468784	1532177	126250	5.0	Perhaps Too Cluttered With Too Many Characters	I have to be honest and confess that I'm not a Robert Altman fan . His movies suffer from being cluttered with too many characters having their own sub stories which detract from the narrative COOKIE'S FORTUNE can be used as a good example . For the first half hour of the movie we're introduced to the characters of a small deep south town called Holly Springs , yes that's right a film that lasts two hours wastes quarter of its running time on umpteen different characters . After this has taken place an event happens which sets up the main plot of where a black man is blamed for something he didn't do and if you're able to stay awake at this point you're doing well Did I mention this was a comedy ? I thought I have to mention it since some people might be confused that this might be some type of hard hitting drama like IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT and the movie continues in the same type of unlikely manner of blackly comical characterisation and plot twists . But if you like Altman you'll probably like this movie . I don't much and I didn't much
468647	1532177	118528	5.0	Not Too Impressed . Know What I Mean ?	After reading all the glowing praise about this remake of 12 ANGRY MEN I sat down hoping to see a reinterpretation of a classic film , but it's more or less the same script filmed in colour with a different cast . No doubt one way of looking at it is that the original Reginald Rose script hasn't been destroyed by radical rewriting but like the remakes of THE GETAWAY and PSYCHO it seems a waste of time making something that's almost the exact same as the original shot for shot . The producers do deserve some credit for making the rabid reactionary racist a black muslim thereby saving the viewer from some patronizing PC garbage but at the end of the day the original movie didn't need remaking and this TVM proves it
469708	1532177	352247	5.0	Where's Dave ?	I didn't have any idea what THE CICERONES was going to be about before watching it but after seeing it I can only describe this short film as " LEAGUE OF GENTLEMEN Go To A Slavonic Country " An English art lover travels abroad during the inter-war years and visits a cathedral that is inhabited by an assortment of weird characters . Can you see the parallels ? When I say the art critic is played by Mark Gatiss you can't help but be reminded of the cult BBC comedy and the only thing missing is the guy done up like a black minstrel wondering where Dave is I wouldn't go as far as saying THE CICERONES will only appeal to LEAGUE OF GENTLEMAN fans but Bob misses the point . If he was a regular viewer of the cult BBC comedy he would have noticed the structure and atmosphere is identical to LEAGUE . Thankfully Gatiss and co aren't a one trick pony but this is fairly disappointing short film
470202	1532177	105226	5.0	The Most Unlikely Coincidences Ever Seen On Film	SPOILERS - AND NO I'M NOT MAKING THEM UP Michael , a drifter , comes across someone who thinks he's a hitman and pays Michael a large sum of money to murder his wife's lover , but Michael decides he's going to take the money and run . So Michael's driving away from town and accidentally runs a man down . It's at this point I wish to plead to the reader to believe me because this actually happens in the movie , the man Michael ran down is the person Michael is supposed to kill , but being a decent man ( Remember he's a drifter , not a hitman and he ran the person down by accident ) he drives his victim to hospital where it's revealed the victim was shot twice in the stomach before getting run down . The police are called and when the sherrif arrives Michael recognises him as the man who paid him to do the hit . So the sherrif takes Michael out to the desert to shut him up forever but Michael escapes and nearly gets run down by a passing motorist who it turns out is the real hitman , who makes an off the cuff comment about Michael being " One lucky son of a bitch " Considering all this takes place in the first 30 minutes of RED ROCK WEST I'd have thought Michael must be the most unlucky SOB ever to have appeared on celluloid . Think about it As you can imagine RED ROCK WEST takes some swallowing , too much in my humble opinion , to work as a classic thriller . It is enteraining though mainly down to the silly plot twists and it also has a good cast . In fact you've got to admire the actors for all keeping straight faces because if I appeared in this I'd be killing myself laughing at all the unlikely coincidences
468461	1532177	113552	5.0	Good Cast In Very Average Film	Nicolas Cage , Helen Hunt and Samuel L Jackson in a film from the 1990s ! Must be good I thought . Well actually KISS OF DEATH is not all that good , it's by no means bad it's just that the three afore mentioned stars were well known at the time but weren't stars yet . The film was made around the same time as David Caruso was trying to break into films and is really a star vehicle for him . Helen Hunt is fairly effective for the short screentime she gets , Samuel L Jackson is just okay but Nicolas Cage is far too over the top to be taken seriously and will never make a convincing screen villain which is why you'll never see him play a baddy these days . As for Caruso . . . well can anyone name anything he's been in apart from NYPD BLUES or JADE ? Bottom line is KISS OF DEATH is a mediocre remake let down mainly by its star and a very weak script
469758	1532177	64840	5.0	The Problem I Had With This . . . .	. . . . is the same problem I have with DEAD POET'S SOCIETY or any other film set around school - I couldn't relate to it . I've always found teachers to be crypto-fascists and yet as at least one other reviewer pointed out the idea of Miss Brodie being an admirer of Franco and Il Duce just doesn't ring true . In fact I didn't find anything about THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE to ring true . But I guess it's a film for females
468398	1532177	465966	5.0	Bizarre	This is a four minute short where the world is introduced to Eugene Hicks and for a male audience many of us feel we shouldn't have been introduced : " I have what every woman wants . trust me " Trust must be earned Eugene " I'm extremely intelligent and incredibly well paid " Ah that's where the trust must be earned Eugene , if you'd said something like " I'm a complete mug and incredibly well paid " then perhaps you would have got away with " I have what every woman wants " " I drive a Ferrari Enzo and an Aston Martin " What you mean you're able to drive two cars at once ? That must be very conveniant if you want to be in two places at once and not even Michael Schumaker can achieve this remarkable feat But as the story goes on it's revealed that Eugene is doing something very naughty . I won't give away the ending but isn't there a fly in the ointment here ? Eugene looks like he's of mixed race and if he's doing what I think he's doing won't the parents realise something is up if the parents are both white ?
469582	1532177	60355	5.0	Not As Good As I Heard	After reading some of the comments on this page I was expecting more . I sat down to watch DUEL AT DIABLO thinking I'd be watching something similar to ULZANA'S RAID or SOLDIER BLUE , but they're both Vietnam allegories or rather anti Vietnam war allegories from the early 1970s while this movie was made in 1966 when the war was still popular amongst Americans . To be honest I couldn't find any ' Nam subtext and I doubt very much if there was any to start with . Yeah there might be some sympathy shown to the injuns via a throw away line about living on the reservations being lied to , but once you see the tortured bodies of the white eyes you stop feeling sorry for them in any way There is a slight problem with the acting though . Bibi Anderson isn't a native English speaker which means when she delivers her lines like " I - was - better - off - with - the - injuns " they sound very strange coming from her mouth . Sidney Poiter is a good actor but seems strangely cast as Toller and does anyone else think the producers cast Dennis Weaver thinking he was Dennis Hopper ? It's not a bad film and I guess it was violent and sadistic when it was first released but as has been mentioned it hasn't dated well
469447	1532177	430484	5.0	Britain's Answer To Michael Moore's Conspiracy Fantasies	THE POWER OF NIGHTMARES is a heavily hyped documentary series by the BBC in three parts pointing out that America neo conservatives and Islamic terrorists are partners in arms with one needing the other in order to survive . It goes beyond shoehorning facts and ends up trying to out Moore the ridiculous style of Michael Moore with half truths and " facts " which aren't facts at all The series comes in three parts Part 1 - Baby It's Cold Outside Part 2 - The Phantom Victory Part 3 - The Shadows In The Cave I only caught some of the first part but the programme makes the very subjective point that the rise of Islam came about when a young Egyptian student studied in America and came to the conclusion that Western society was decadent , corrupt and meaningless and it was this that caused the culture clash . Most people would dispute this since they draw the conclusion that Khomeini's 1979 revolution in Iran which created the first theocracy in several centuries was the start of Islam Vs the West . The fact that I can't recall the name of this student from Egypt shows how how important he is in the scheme of things . The neo conservatives at the time also thought there was too much decadence and corruption and meaningless in Western culture . You might be shocked to know that that ALL ideaology is based upon the notion that the society we live in has no moral worth and needs to be changed . Communists believe this , fascists believe this , Maoists believe this , Nazis believe this , it's way of thinking that's not the sole preserve of Muslims or radical right wingers The first episode seems to be devoid of the mention of communism which was the bogey man of the American right for 50 years . The programme makes up for it be dedicating the second episode to the Reagen right wing admin supplying Islamists with weapons to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan . This edition is so sloppy in its research that you start to think it's been made to misinform the audience . It insinuates that Osama Bin Laden was a war lord in the conflict when he was only a visiting fighter similar to Western mercenaries who volunteered to fight in the Croat HVO in the early 1990s . The Mujahhedeen ( Literal translation " The soldiers of God " ) were split into 6 different factions , three of which were hardline Islamists : Islamic Party , Islamic society , Islamic Unity and three moderate factions : Islamic Revolutionary Movement , National Islamic Front , and National Liberation Front . None of these factions were led by Bin Laden and not all them were supplied by America , the hardliners were supplied by Pakistan , Egypt and Saudi Arabia . You might like to type in " Robert Fisk interview with Osama Bin Laden " and you'll see the last interview he gave to a Western reporter where he states he had no help from the Americans . Who are you inclined to believe ? This subjective pseudo documentary or Bin Laden himself ? The final part is again debatable where facts are concerned . Al Qaeda is not a cohesive structured organisation . Correct . But does this mean Islamic terrorism is not a threat to the West ? Does this mean for example the Israelis should stop searching Arabs at check points ? Does this mean people should be allowed to carry knives onto jumbo jets ? Again it's a ridiculous notion that because Islamic terrorism is aphallic in structure we've not to worry about terrorist atrocities . It also once again misses out important issues about Afghanistan , for example The Northern Alliance weren't a bunch of warlords but were the same Mujahedeen who defeated the Red Army , the Taliban ( Literal translation " Students of God " ) are Pashtuns from Pakistan not Afghans and it wasn't an Anglo - American invasion of Afghanistan , many countries including France and Germany took part in the invasion which was mandated by the UN . One last point is the suggestion that a " Dirty bomb " is used by Neo Cons in order to make the terrorists seem a bigger threat than they really are but this fear is actually driven by the media not governments . You might like to remember the BBC made a docudrama a couple of months ago called DIRTY WAR which had the scenario of a dirty bomb exploding in London , and let's not forget the BBc co-production called THE GRID . Perhaps a better title for THE POWER OF NIGHTMARES would be PEOPLE IN GLASS HOUSES SHOULDN'T THROW STONES
468458	1532177	109642	5.0	Too Depressing	It's not all that often that we get to see a Stephen King adaption with absolutely no supernatural or horror elements hit the big screen but DOLORES CLAIBORNE is far more disturbing than stuff like GRAVEYARD SHIFT , NEEDFULL THINGS or SALEMS LOT due to the subject matter . It involves trailer trash , unlawful killing , child sex abuse , mental breakdown , wife beating and alcoholism , so it's not got much in the way of entertainment even though it is very well acted by all the cast especially Kathy Bates in the title role . This is a very bleak depressing story which I found to be a total turn off and I'm in no great hurry to watch it again
468424	1532177	106292	5.0	It Wasn't Necessary To Make This Sequel	Talk about having friends in high places and merciful ones at that because what other excuse is there to make a belated sequel to STAKEOUT ? " Belated " is the operative word here because if it was made two years after the original movie I could understand this because that's the only reason the Hollywood industry exists - To make money and let's not forget that whatever the shortcomings STAKEOUT made a lot of money at the box office . So it seems very strange that the studio waited six years before making a sequel to the original , stranger still that both buddy movies and sequels weren't in fashion in 1993 Despite the lack of imagination in producing ANOTHER STAKEOUT it's nowhere as terrible as it could have been . In between episodic comedy adventure scenes the original heroes ( Dreyfuss and Estevez ) are given a new assignment where they team up with a female DA and have to go through a charade of being a family in order to find a witness to a very important trial . I suppose that's the problem the plot is a one trick pony and the further the film goes on it becomes clearer that the pony wasn't too healthy to start with and on the subject of animal euphemisms did anyone notice the jokes involving all creatures great and small ? There's an octopus , a fish , a cat and dog ! It's not a bad film and will pass the time on a rainy afternoon but it does demonstrate how lazy studios are at producing movies
469707	1532177	330929	5.0	What's It About ?	This centres around a sectary working at a firm called Funtime Inc but that's about all I can tell you because the narrative didn't make much sense to me and it's as if director Miranda Bowen is trying to film a shampoo advert ! The phone rings , the sectary picks up the phone then we get surreal scenes where the sectary is in a tropical rain forest surrounded by exotic animals where she's at one with nature I notice the other comments are similar to mine . I think the problem with making short films is that it's perceived as a director's medium . Like a feature length movie a short must have a decent script in order for it to work and that's the problem with STAGNATE - The audience are not drawn into the story
470031	1532177	59418	5.0	A Maverick Movie ?	After seeing MAJOR DUNDEE I was in something of a state of shock . It's not often I have seen a movie that suffers from such structural and contextual madness as this . I came to this site and noticed that people claim that the truth behind this movie is all down to director Sam Peckinpah making things up as he went along . No doubt Peckinpah loved the Western genre so allowing him total free rein over a movie like this is kind of like letting a child loose in a sweetie shop and will lead to one thing - Disaster No doubt if this had been filmed in the 1970s we'd have seen MAJOR DUNDEE analysed as being a very good example of how the director is the auteur of a movie but in the mid 1960s Hollywood studios didn't allow this type of maverick behaviour so it's highly unlikely anyone made this as freely structured art and the producers should be blamed for a lack of discipline . Plots and characters come and go as if Peckinpah just got bored with them and there's some relatively bloody action . I don't necessarily mean gory action but look carefully at the battle in the river where the river literally runs with blood . In reality how many people would have to die before the water turned that colour ? I also couldn't help noticing the ludicrous dialogue for the Indians , did I hear the last words of " That'll fix them " coming from the chief ? If you're aware of the films of Sam Peckinpah you'll know that he can make an absolutely outstanding movie when he's forced into it , THE WILD BUNCH is arguably the greatest western of all time while CROSS OF IRON is in my opinion the greatest movie set during the second world war but more often than not his films are bizarre exercicises in excess and MAJOR DUNDEE is a good example . It's also one of the few movies where American accents state " We ran from the French "
468591	1532177	160797	5.0	I'm Confused At The Lack Of Logic	Round about the same time as this film was produced there was a new international court of law set up as to how wars are conducted which led me to believe that RULES OF ENGAGEMENT would point out the ( Im ) practicalities and ( A ) moralities and possible hypocrisy of such an international court but all these important ideas are totally ignored in a bland courtroom drama that has gaping holes of logic . SPOILERS First of all if Col Childers is going to be used as a scapegoat then why on earth is he found not guilty , especially when he's got such a poor attorney like Hodge ? , even more confusing when he's being prosecuted by a hotshot prosecueter like Maj Briggs . This doesn't really make sense . Nor is the fact that several Americans were killed in the action . Does that not prove it was self defence ? And as several reviewers have pointed out American forces have done far worse in real life than the scenario seen here . I suppose the screenwriters were told to write a happy ending then the set the rest of the script round that . It doesn't feel like the script was well thought out So just to sum up this could have been a really good thought provoking anti-war pro-soldier drama on the nation state Vs international law , but it's just a dumb court room drama
469175	1532177	130089	6.0	At Least The Female Cast Are Hot	Thankfully the only dodgy thing about LOLITA 2000 is the title . Come to think of it it's a really stupid title for a soft core porn movie which may turn off a potential audience , but take it from me that the cast are well above the age of consent . I should know because watched this movie over and over again , made a note of the cast members names , typed them into an internet search engine to find out their dates of births and I can confirm it's all above board . We're not talking Traci Lords hereAs you'd expect in these type of movies there's a very basic premise that's just an excuse to show some soft core sex , but LOLITA 2000 is better than most simply because the cast look like they might actually be having sex , and boy are the actresses fit with special mention going to Gabriella HallIf I have any complaints it's to do with the sound cutting out during the sex scenes to be replaced by muzak which is my main gripe about all these soft core movies . But I musn't grumble too much because the cast are hot which is not something I can say about many hard core movies
468915	1532177	95484	6.0	Patchey Ghost Story	On FILM 88 legendary British film critic Barry Norman reviewed two " horror " movies . One was HELLBOUND : HELLRAISER 2 and the other was LADY IN WHITE . Barry hated HELLBOUND which is unsurprising since he is notoriouslyintolerant of gore and violence but he did praise THE LADY IN WHITE but after finally seeing it I have to admit it's a very patchy movie Much of the problem lies in the film trying to say a little too much . It's set in Willowpoint Falls in 1962 and of course the civil rights campaign is just getting in to flow which means there's a subplot that isn't actually needed . If it'd been set in 1988 you'd have a much more streamlined story . Considering the title of the movie the title character doesn't make an appearance until well into the second half of the running time and up till then GIRL IN PINK would have been a more appropriate title In fact nothing much at all happens until a subplot featuring a ring comes to the fore and when it does the story becomes compelling and exciting and a little bit disturbing . Unfortunately this doesn't happen until something like 15 minutes before the credits start rolling which gives you an idea of how much potential is wasted and that's a great shame
468429	1532177	70328	6.0	One Of The Better Bond Films	LIVE AND LET DIE is an improvement over the two preceding Bond films . Humour is kept in its place , Guy Hamilton doesn't reach the artistic heights of GOLDFINGER but improves on DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER , the plot has a relatively realistic idea with Yaphet Kotto playing one of the better villains with the right mix of charm and menace and with all the bad guys being black we get to hear lots of funky dialogue like " Yo , watch out bro you gotta honky on you're tail " . In these PC times you aren't allowed to write lines like that anymore which is a shame . Where the film falls down is Roger Moore as Bond . It's through no fault of his own but Sean Connery is an impossible act to follow , cinema goers must have been shocked in 1962 when they saw a violent anti hero killing bad guys in cold blood in DR NO . Here however there's no ruthlessness to Moore's Bond and therefore no real impact , but I suppose both the producers and Moore didn't want the part played as a Connery clone so this is forgivable and Moore is a lot better than Lazenby , and the series hadn't developed into farce as we'd see in later Moore Bonds like MOONRAKER and A VEIW TO A KILLSo an entertaining film to watch if you've got a couple of hours to spare . Probably Moore's second best film in the series after THE SPY WHO LOVED M
468907	1532177	325055	6.0	Better Than I Was Expecting	As soon as the opening credits started I started to have serious reservations about SYLVIA . The company credits read that this was a BBC film funded by the arts council which could only mean one thing - It's of little interest to anyone who didn't work on the movie , but to be fair I was pleasantly surprised as to how the story drew me in This is a bio-pic on Sylvia Plath the wife of famous poet Laurette Ted Hughes . I hate poetry and fail to see the merits of it and find poets to be the most self centered , esoteric and pretentious of writers and this is what I liked about SYLVIA - If you hate poetry you can still appreciate this movie which is an intense melodrama featuring neurosis , paranoia and sexual betrayal . Some people have criticised the movie for being too much of a " kitchen sink melodrama " but I fail to see how this can be a criticism and much preferred seeing a bleak and depressing film than one which concerned itself with poetry
468768	1532177	57244	6.0	Not Really The Film You've Read About	This is a rather obscure film that is rarely shown on television . Interestingly if THE LEATHER BOYS does turn up on television it usually is described as " A newly married bridegroom becomes besotted with a charismatic homosexual " which isn't really explaining the plot properly and also misses out on an important subtext . The subtext is that people we bond with aren't the people we think they really are The story revolves around recently married Reggie who has a 16 year old bride called Dot and unfortunately Reggie is starting to realise that married life isn't as he expected it and starts to hang around with a young free and single biker called Pete . It's this young free and single attitude that attracts Colin to Pete . Throughout the running time the narrative hints subtly that Pete may be gay - Dudley Sutton doesn't play Pete in a camp way either - but it's only revealed for certain that he is when Reggie waits for Pete in a closet gay bar with the optimism that they're both going to emigrate to America . As it turns out via Pete's gay associates in the bar that the boat they're supposed to be catching is bound to Liverpool , not America as Pete had promised . Cut to a devastated , disillusioned and depressed Reggie walking off into the sunset , still young enough to start a new life but with no one to start a new life with THE LEATHER BOYS is one of those films that may have seemed controversial at the time but probably wasn't . There's no overt sexuality on screen and you do notice in the final scenes how homosexuals are portrayed in a camp stereotypical manner so it's maybe a film that gays won't like due to dated stereotypes and many straights won't like because they're misled as to it being a gay love story ala BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN . It's the sort of British kitchen sink storyline that would be better suited to something like CORONATION STREET
468958	1532177	95863	6.0	I Never Saw The Original . . .	. . . . But did this stop me enjoying the sequel ? No not really , I have to admit I didn't have a clue what was going on but the bizarre happenings probably added to the fun The story starts with Reggie a bald middle aged man with a pony tail ( ! ) rescuing his teenage friend Mike from the midget monks that appeared in the Joy Division video of Atmosphere . Did I say I was unable to understand what was happening on screen ? They then go on a quest to hunt down The Tall Man who is the leader of the midget monks in order to save the world , a sort of LORD OF THE RINGS where the heroes have poor hair stylists . That's it as far as the plot goes and unless you've seen the original you'll be as confused as I was . Still I found this movie vaguely fascinating and it did remind me of HALLOWEEN 3 : SEASON OF THE WITCH in some parts along with THE EVIL DEAD . Being a 1980s horror movie the production values are relatively low while everything seems to be centered around the gore level . Thankfully the film never takes itself too seriously and has a certain amount of charm amongst the mutilations and murders - Just don't ask me to write a thesis on it
468484	1532177	106455	6.0	It's Not That Bad	I'm slightly puzzled as to some of the harsher comments featuring BOILING POINT . I will confess that it's not a thriller classic but I will defend it against the accusation that it's a terrible movie Red ( Dennis Hopper ) is released from prison and owes some mafia types money and so is given a seven day ultimatum . Jimmy ( Wesley Snipes - And no early 90s urban thriller is complete without Wesley Snipes ) loses a friend in the course of duty and the audience instantly know that these two unconnected characters will tie in with the plot somehow - And they do in a script that while not being the most tightly plotted screenplay you will ever see since there's a few too many characters involved is at least undemanding and easy to follow . On the style front it's not exactly in the same league as HEAT but probably contains more substance than an episode of MAIMI VICE while we also get to see an early supporting role from Viggo Mortenson . I rate BOILING POINT
469879	1532177	67525	6.0	Changes Are Justified	Many people most notably original author Richard Matheson have complained about the changes of this film adaption of I AM LEGEND , but I feel the changes are justified . The novel has few characters and little dialogue which doesn't make it an ideal candidate for film adaption , likewise the book's subtle subtext on deviancy which would ask us to empathise with the vampires would be too much for a cinema audience so I feel the changes to the novel are justified . THE OMEGA MAN is a fair film . The mutant villains are nasty enough though their calling each other " Brother " does grate after a while . There's plenty of action and Charlton Heston does make a good hero . I liked this film
470214	1532177	166013	6.0	Slightly Flawed With Its Polemical Viewpoint	Journalists in films are cliches . They're always shown as crusaders setting the world to right whatever the cost to themselves . This is a totally cliched portrayal as some of the worst vermin breathing are journalists , many of whom are driven by greed and ego and will print absolutely anything to sell newspapers , they're not too bothered what they print just as long as it it ties in with a misguided editorial line and sells a few more copies , and that's the problem I had with WHEN THE SKY FALLS , its heroine Sinead Hamilton is shown trying to take on Dublin's drug dealers almost single handed . I also had a problem with the black and white characterisation , everyone is either a nasty piece of work or a victim , the exception being MacKay played very well by Patrick Bergin who's a sort of Dublin equvilent of Jack Regan or Frank Burnside who's not below bending the rules to get results . He's by far the most interesting character in a film that suffers from a rather shaky view of drugs . Smack addicts are shown to be hapless victims at the mercy of their dealers , but is this actually true ? I was under the impression that many addicts also sell drugs in real life in order to pay for their addiction , not as shown here selling paintings to tourists . And there's no real attempt to address the wider issues of drugs and what to do about the problem in this film . As one reviewer has touched upon WHEN THE SKY FALLS tries to be a straightforward thriller and a socially aware film at the same time and by doing so it fails in trying two things at once . WHEN THE SKY FALLS isn't a bad film , in fact it was probably the best one I saw that night , but the other movies I saw were THE MUMMY RETURNS , SPECIES 2 and CODE RED so the competition wasn't up to much . Hopefully next time someone makes a film dealing with drugs they might like to take the unpopular view that people volunteer to become addicts , a point TRAINSPOTTING made very well
468426	1532177	51453	6.0	I Doubt Very Few People Watching This In 2005 Will Understand It	In 1960 Britain was the first European country to scrap conscription . This is not to be confused by the American style draft system because with very few exceptions all able bodied men who turned 18 had to serve two years in the forces regardless of social and educational background . The scrapping of conscription was a good thing because there's nothing more dangerously useless to an army than a soldier who doesn't want to be a soldier I'm pointing this out because that's the concept behind CARRY ON SERGEANT - A professional NCO who receives the worst possible raw recruits into his platoon and you find yourself questioning who you're supposed to feel sorry for the most , the recruits who don't want to be there or the sergeant who doesn't want them there but that wouldn't have been the case when this film was made , a 1958 audience would have related more to the recruits than to the sergeant . This sort of idea will go above the heads of a modern day audience and the film has dated very badly not least because it's the very first in CARRY ON franchise . Anyone expecting sexual innuendos will be very upset to see they're more or less conspicuous by their absence . In fact with the exception of a few cast members like Kenneth Connor , Charles Hawthrey and Terry Scott a lot of people would with hindsight have trouble believing that this was in fact part of the CARRY ON franchise I've got to be honest and say the lack of the CARRY ON trademarks is no bad thing because if double entredes is the selling point of a comedy then 1958 censorship rules would have meant the innuendo would have been curtailed and that would have meant no humour full stop . Instead this is a gentle but ultimately heart warming English comedy featuring a typecast but impressive enough William Hartnell training a platoon he thinks is destined for failure
469901	1532177	109686	6.0	Could Have Been Even Better	I did enjoy parts of DUMB AND DUMBER , notably the blind boy with the parakeet , the cop tasting the beer and the manly love in the toilets , but I can't help thinking it could have been a whole lot better if the two main protagonists played by Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels had a little more depth . As it stands they're both stupid , they both sport ridiculous hairstyles and they're both in love with the same women and that's about all the character naunces we get . It's very difficult to believe in them as real people due to their stupidity becoming just a little too incredible and it's not helped by Jim Carrey's slightly OTT performance , though to be fair he's not as bad as he usually is . It is good to see that the Farrelly brothers improved this protagonist flaw with their next movie KINGPIN and hit the button with THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY by having the main characters play everything straight in comedy situations All in all DUMB AND DUMBER is a fairly good comedy ( A genre I usually despise ) let down somewhat with silliness . Not a comedy classic but entertaining enough
470018	1532177	117090	6.0	Bad Enough To Remain Very Watchable	I didn't think THE HAUNTED HEART ( As this movie is known in the UK ) was going to be up to much and it wasn't but this didn't stop me from enjoying it immensely . As ElviraVixen pointed out it's awful but will hold your interest for most of its running time . The plot itself revolves around Olivia Hendrix a rather sad and lonely middle aged woman who has only one son Tom and only one friend Mrs Jay and because of her sad loneliness she smothers young Tom too much while she listens to Mrs Jay too much . When Tom decides to leave the nest things start to head for a collision course The production values are somewhat poor and if it wasn't for some strong language you'd think this was yet another TVM but what makes it so watchable is the performances and Michael Angella's disturbingly seedy script . Granted it's rather awful but I did enjoy Mrs Jay ( Superbly played by Olympia Dukakis ) attempted seduction of Tom and the quite laughable dialogue : " Fuchsia ? But I hate fuchsia " and " Do you think you can remember that you stupid bitch ? " It might be a good idea to wear a diaper while watching this since you might just wet yourself laughing . The climax is gloriously contrived and incomprehensible but sums up the movie perfectly and my only real criticism is that we never hear Pink Floyd's track Mother which almost certainly inspired this terrible but highly entertaining movie
470217	1532177	90756	6.0	Why Is David Lynch So Popular ? . . . .	. . . . Because he's easy to analyze . Look at the opening sequence to BLUE VELVET - A montage of shots of suburban America followed by a slow pan into the grass where insects crawl from the ground . Don't you get it ? Like the ground there's something ugly trying to break through the calm reassuring surface of suburban America . Gosh what a genius Lynch must be allowing the audience into the concept of subtext like that . But can anyone tell me why he continually casts Kyle McClachlan in his movies ? He's got a pretty face but not much screen presence . But BLUE VELVET isn't a bad film ( Though it's not as good as its high IMDB rating says it is ) , Lynch doesn't go overboard with his often pretentious style of directing and it's a film that would deserve the oft used tag of " Hitchcock style thriller " for the most part , though Dennis Hopper's show stopping performance as the villain is something better suited to a Scorsese picture . But it's Hopper who made BLUE VELVET so memorable for me
468438	1532177	59896	6.0	The Fight Scenes Are Good	Oh dear , take a look at the production values in the opening scene of THE WAR LORD . We see location long shots of the characters with their backs to camera so we can't see their faces then cut to a medium shot of Charlton Heston and co standing against back projection . This happens throughout the movie with shots of characters in long shot ( And who are obvious stand ins for the big name actors ) to jarring cuts of Chuck and company standing in front of studio sets or back projection or indeed stock footage of wild life . It's very annoying and oh so obvious There's several things that don't go together . One is Arabs and nuclear reactors , another is Steven Seagal and celluloid , but perhaps the two things that should never combine is American accents and ye olde world dialogue . Richard Boone especially is totally unconvincing as an 11th century warrior while Chuck is . . . well he's Charlton Heston , a man who shouts and has a strange looking hairstyle . I don't believe people looked or spoke like this in Normandy But what the hell , this is a Hollywood movie and Hollywood shows us what it's been doing best for decades : ignoring historical facts , giving us good guys and bad guys , a bit of romance and most of all - action . Despite the rather pondering nature of the script and the patchey production values the last third of the movie is taken up with some very impressive battle scenes as the bad guys try to storm the good guys castle . Okay we've been spoiled rotten recently by Peter Jackson's LORD OF THE RINGS and THE WAR LORD battle scenes might not seem that good in comparison but please remember this was made in 1965 have must have seemed quite breath taking at the time . Did anyone else feel watching the Vikings trying to burn down the doors that it gave Peter Jackson some inspiration for the battle of Helm's Deep ? As a footnote to the fight scenes I remember as a young child watching a movie that featured Vikings running about engulfed in flames after attacking a castle . It wasn't until last week at the grand old age of 37 that I realised while watching it again that the movie that impressed me all those distant years ago was THE WAR LORD , and I wasn't disappointed seeing the battle sequences again
469122	1532177	105813	6.0	Show , Don't Tell	A man has apparently committed suicide in he New Mexico desert and beside his body is a bag containing $500 , 000 so local sheriff Ray Dolezal decides to keep the dead man's rendezvous to unravel the mystery A lot of people have complained about WHITE SANDS being implausiable , contrived or over plotted . My complaint is that it's really none of these things but suffers from a fundamental flaw we're warned about at basic screen writing course " Show , don't tell " . For much of the screen time the plot twists and turns well enough but ion the last 15 minutes we have to listen to characters state " I'm not how you think I am , I'm really . . . . " or we listen to characters give away the plot which means the climax is very much spoon fed to the audience which is something of a shame since while not being a truly great thriller WHITE SANDS deserves to be remembered more than it really is . I guess the dislodge heavy last act conspires to make this a very forgettable movie
469645	1532177	411715	7.0	Kneel Before The Twisted Humour Of Robert Hammond	There's something so very poetic about this Pyramids Of Mars DVD extra . Sutekh , despite only appearing one DOCTOR WHO story is one of the all time great villains from the show while actor / writer Robert Hammond is one of the most remarkable characters from DOCTOR WHO fandom I do have a problem in discussing this sketch since it's only seven ( 7 ) minutes long and follows on from Sutekh's time as a destroyer of worlds and I'd only give away the best bits thereby spoiling the fun of watching . To give you a favour of OH MUMMY ! go and look up my review of TV OFFAL where I mention " Rob " who is the same Rob Hammond who wrote this funny sketch . Rob also used to edit a fanzine called Auton which really tore into DOCTOR WHO with a incisive and often cruel sense of humour . If you think someone phoning up 10 Downing Street asking how the Prime Minister can negoiate surrendering to Davros when there's no wheelchair access is funny then you'll find OH MUMMY right up your street DOCTOR WHO fandom's a more miserable place without the twisted mind of Robert Hammond
468370	1532177	268695	7.0	Pretty Good Remake	I was interested in seeing this remake simply to find out if it was as bad as a myriad of critics have suggested it to be . I did love the 1960 version and I am not keen on people remaking my favourite movies , but surely last year's remake of HG Wells romantic fantasy wasn't going to be as bad as painted was it ? Herbert George Wells wrote the source novel so why not call the hero Herbert or George ? It's also a Victorian sounding name so why's the hero got a name that resembles Steve Martin's character in THE MAN WITH TWO BRAINS ? This screenplay just like David Duncan's from the 1960 version lacks an opening hook but it does speculate that even if time travel did exist it would be impossible to change ones destiny , an interesting thought . ScreenwriterJohn Logan adds a post modernist sequence featuring both HG Wells and STAR TREK . I didn't think the humour worked very well but I had to admire his cheek , and since everyone cycles everywhere Logan suggests that in the mid 21st century America has elected a president from the green party which no doubt caused civilisation to collapse . Like most other movies set in the far flung future there are illogical gaps in the screenplay . For example remnants of the present day would still exist . Put it like this : The pyramids of Egypt are a few thousand years old and at the present rate of degeneration they won't exist in a few thousand years but Alexander goes 798 , 000 years into the future and the skeletal remains of 21st century New York still remain ! , but as I said this is a common flaw in time travel stories as is the ridiculous notion that hundreds of thousands of years into the future people will still be able to understand and speak English , so this can be forgiven on the grounds of dramatic license . My only real criticism of the screenplay is that John Logan borrows a bit too much from Duncan's earlier screenplay , otherwise this is a fairly good adaptation on Wells groundbreaking novel . Adding the ubermorlock is an inspired idea that works very wellI'm in two minds who to credit / criticise as director . As you may know Simon Wells left the project days before the project was completed and was replaced by Gore Verbinski so for the purposes of this review I'll refer to the director simply as " The director " , and the director does manage one show stopping moment as the camera pans out from Alexander at the end of the 19th century across an ever evolving landscape eventually stopping on a lunar colony . The most controversial aspect of the film seems to be the casting or more especially the casting of dark skinned actors as the eloi , but I fail to see what the problem is . The eloi live on the surface in bright sunlight so why shouldn't they be dark skinned ? It's also in keeping with the social darwinism of Wells novel . The eloi have evolved due to environment the same way as the ubermorlock has evolved , and social darwinism is totally amoral so there's no right or wrong , or good and bad involved . I do wish people would stop playing the race card . As for the ordinary morlocks they're superbly designed with some great make up involved but the director throws a massive spanner in the works by having them running a hundred miles an hour and being able to jump great heights which suddenly makes them unconvincing which is a great pity , they would have worked better as men dressed up rather than CGI supermen . I did like Jeremy Irons as the scene stealing ubermorlock though . A word of warning for those of you who suffer from photo sensitivity , sadly once again this is a movie that heavily features strobe lighting . I'm not epileptic which is just as well because I wouldn't want to risk a seizure watching THE TIME MACHINE . Sadly there seems to be more and more films being produced with this technique in style used and sadly I've had to keep saying - Stop using strobe lighting in movies . It's totally irresponsible for directors to do this . To sum up the 2002 remake of THE TIME MACHINE was light years away from the debacle I'd been led to expect . It's fairly good in its own right but not as good as George Pal's 1960 version , maybe because it lacks the charm of the former , a charm that movie had in abundance , but this version is still pretty good as remakes go
469953	1532177	112744	7.0	Too Liberal And Certainly Confused	I don't think much of Sean Penn as an actor , his OTT performance in CASUALTIES OF WAR almost ruined the entire film for me and it wasn't only that film that Penn yanked my chain , but despite this I can't help noticing that he does have some talent behind the camera . He's not flawless of course and his flaws are plain to see in his later film THE PLEDGE but I found THE CROSSING GUARD to be both very moody and very moving with some truly great acting on display . It does suffer from one deep flaw - Penn's script The problem is how the two protagonists are written . Freddy Gales daughter is killed by drunk driver John Booth so guess which character THE CROSSING GUARD portrays in a sympathetic light ? That's right , the one who killed the girl ! I won't go as far to say that Penn has painted Booth as the real victim , but why on earth does he paint Freddy as being such a harsh character ? He's vulgar , always in a drunken state and when it comes to women his attitude is disgusting , in fact he's a dirty old man and there's nothing to prove it's caused by the reaction to the death of his daughter . He is the opposite of Booth who is shown as a different character whose spell in prison has changed him into a profound man able to contribute to society . I see so the man bereaved by the criminal is actually the bad guy ? I'm not sure if this is what Penn is saying because the message is somewhat confused . But despite this serious flaw I'd like to see more films directed by Sean Penn , just as long as the producer keeps him away from a word processor
470234	1532177	66206	7.0	A Strange Combinition Of Good And Bad	I saw this the same night I saw THE HURRICANE a movie that claims to be a bio-pic on Rubin Carter but which is nothing more than total fabrication . PATTON is an entirely different kettle of fish and while not being entirely accurate ( I'll come to that later ) does at least have many accurate points Undoubtedly the best aspect of the movie is George C Scott who is physically almost identical to George Patton . He captures the arrogant mannerisms of the American general very well and few and far between are movies where a performance like this dominates a movie . Ironically this is a case of where an Oscar for best actor was fully deserved and yet the recipient turned down the honour . There's also obviously a lot of thought gone into the screenplay as to where to begin and end the story . Do you start when Patton was a child and find out what motivated him to be a soldier ? Do you start when he fought in the American Expidionary force in France 1917-18 ? Do you finish the story with his death ? I think that writers Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H North have got the settings right with starting the story with the immediate aftermath of The Kasserine Pass and finishing the story while Patton was still alive . The screenplay itself is somewhat knowingly ironic as Patton spouts " America has never and will never lose a war " while it was becoming obvious in 1970 there was no way the US were going to be victors in Vietnam . It was a well known fact that Patton despised Monty and much of Patton's motives were of beating Montgomery as much as the Germans and this might have led to needless deaths of men under Patton's command . The screenplay while not exactly spelling this out does hint that his dislike of Monty led to Patton's reckless streak and the audience are left to make up their own mind on this issue . It was also well known that Patton wanted to throw back the Soviets from Eastern Europe ( Monty also had a hatred of communism but was far less vocal about it ) and there are conspiracy theories that the car accident that killed Patton wasn't an accident at all . Thankfully the screenwriters and producers have absolutely no time for any conspiracy theories of any kind While being a good movie PATTON fails to be great one simply because niggling little faults creep into the movie like historical inaccuracies . In the aftermath the Germans discuss the battle of Kasserine Pass where " The Americans were led by the British general Anderson " Who was Anderson ? The Americans who were badly defeated at the battle were led by American general Lloyd Fredendall without doubt the worst allied general of the war and it was this that led to Patton being appointed to his post . Rommel is portrayed as having the utmost respect for Patton and his American troops but in reality this wasn't actually the case . Throughout the war Erwin Rommel had contempt for American equipment ( With good reason since German Panther and Tiger tanks were far superior to the American built Shermans and the same applied to preceding equipment ) and servicemen and counted Monty as his arch nemesis not Patton . Also as with most American war movies made round about this time the tank battles fought between Americans and Germans seem to be composed of both sides using American tanks built in the 1950s All in all a bio-pic that while being better than many others isn't flawless but like I said if you want to see how NOT to make a bio-pic watch THE HURRICAN
468396	1532177	100746	7.0	Is That Real Sex ?	LA TAREA is filmed in real time in a single room and features a total cast of two actors . This is not an epic film by any means . In fact I wouldn't have actually remembered its broadcast on Channel 4 if it hadn't been for the fact that the two characters Marcelo and Virginia indulge in a sex session , but what a sex session it is ! It's not the type of graphic sex you'd see in a hard core porn film but I don't believe for a moment the actor and actress are NOT really having sex . Maybe that's the point of the film , the way the scene is shot is rather subtle and it's left to the audience to make up their own minds , but I don't think anyone is that good an actor during a love scene
468621	1532177	83190	7.0	Better Than I Expected	As THIEF started I thought I'd be watching some sort of shallow art house debacle debut from Michael Mann . The first ten minutes only contains one line of dialogue with a terrible and annoying soundtrack from Tangerine Dream very similar to Mann's later horror flick THE KEEP . A ridiculous scene follows this musical intro when Frank , the thief of the title shows a fence the diamonds he stole - In a crowded cafe ! It was at this point I thought I was going to be getting a feature length episode of MIAMI VICE , but things started to improve very quickly . James Caan as Frank gives one of the best performances of his career in this movie , watch the scene where he describes his prison experiences and the scene in the adoption agency , an excellent performance , oh and the rest of the cast give a good showing too in this violent , gritty , foul mouthed thriller . My only criticism is that the ending is very similar to the ones Mann often used in MIAMI VICE and like the start of the movie the TD soundtrack is very intrusive at this point
470022	1532177	57076	7.0	Intelligent And Complex . Perhaps Too Much So !	This is an early Bond movie that is very intelligent and complex . After being defeated by Bond in DR NO , the criminal organisation SPECTRE devise a plan to bump off Bond while at the same time humiliating the British and Soviet intelligence agencies . The " problem " with this Bond film is that because it is so complex and intelligent it never really feels like a Bond film . Viewed beside DR NO and GOLDFINGER it never feels like it belongs in the same series and while it's certainly better than THUNDERBALL it's never as much fun as YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE due to the sensible premise See it's the premise . Bond is never really given much to do , he's to meet a Soviet defector who has got her hands on a decipher machine and they've to meet a British agent on a train . At no point does anything ridiculously spectacular happen and you often think this is a story written by John Le Carre or a sequel to NORTH BY NORTHWEST . Oh don't get me wrong FRWL is much better than most of the Bond movies from the 1970s and 80s , it just never feels like a Bond film despite the appearance of a mad lesbian woman with strange footwear
468840	1532177	57115	7.0	Overrated But Entertaining American Movie	This came third in Channel 4's recent 100 GREATEST WAR MOVIES poll a few months ago which did rather surprise me since I've always found it somewhat overrated but it does remain a fairly entertaining American movie Yes THE GREAT ESCAPE is an American movie and I'm glad that the IMDb classes it so . It's directed by an American , is produced and financed by an American studio and most ironic of all the theme tune that is adopted and chanted by English football fans was written by the American composer Elmer Bernstien . It may contain many British actors but notice also the likes of Garner , Bronson and Coburn playing British Commonwealth characters which is down to what's known as " Audience identification " ie if a movie is made with American money the Yanks want their movie to do well in America hence nearly every " British " movie you see has a major character played by an American actor As for the story itself everyone has seen the movie ( We in Britain get to see it almost once a year usually at Xmas ) so I won't linger on it too long except to say it comes in what can only be described as two parts . The first part centres on the build up of the escape with the movie's tongue firmly in its cheek ( Werner the stupid German , man jumps on bunk and it collapses etc ) with the prisoners on the run making up the second part of the story which is more serious in tone . Also watch out for the ironic scene early in the film where a character chastises someone for replying in English to a question in German as the escapees plan their escape with the character later on making the same mistake himself . Who says Americans have irony deficiency ?
468724	1532177	320661	7.0	Sometimes Wonderful . Often Irritating	I'd heard a lot about KINGDOM OF HEAVEN when it was released in 2005 . Most of the reviews were rather uncomplimentary so I made a point of missing it until it was broadcast on Channel 4 last night and as I write this review I remember a lot of beautiful things about this movie . Unfortunately I can remember far more things that annoyed me Ridley Scott has been swotting up on the films and technique of David Lean and in many ways Scott is a natural successor to that legendary film director . The battle scenes are even better than the ones seen in Jackson's THE TWO TOWERS and RETURN OF THE KING and at no time did I believe I was watching an unconvincing CGI battle fest , just an army of thousands of extras walloping each other over the head like you'd see in the greatest Hollywood epics of yesteryear . Scott has also assembled a truly great cast that includes household names like Neeson and Irons alongside very effective character actors like Norton , Glen , Thewlis , Sheen and Gleeson . It must have been something of a gamble for Scott to cast pretty boy Bloom in the lead role since he's the sort of " movie star " who's only famous because of his good looks rather than any outstanding thespian ability but Orlando Bloom probably gives his greatest performance in this film . The only thing that the director Can be criticised for is an over reliance of slow motion during the battle scenes but apart from that everything else on screen is Oscar worthy , though since Scott was under rewarded at award ceremonies you get the feeling that he was trying a little too hard to win an Oscar There's an old saying that " if a film is good then it's down to the director and if it's bad it's down to the screenwriter " and this is certainly true of KINGDOM OF HEAVEN . Throughout the running time I was left scratching my head wondering about characters motives and why certain characters did certain things and let's not ignore the clichés of " You are a brave warrior so I will let you live " type moments . Some people claim that the studio should be held responsible rather than screenwriter William Monahan since they made several cuts to the final print and there's a disjointed feel to the narrative . Perhaps this is true but I wonder how many people watching this on DVD or on television like me had to keep logging in to the wikipedia in order to understand what was happening on screen . It should also be pointed out that there's a rather politically correct feel to the story with neither Christians or Muslims being portrayed as out and out villains with only the Knight templars being portrayed as evil . One wonders if the knight templars were still in existence today if they'd be shown in this way . In many ways it's like watching a second world war film where Germans are shown as being as much as victims of Nazism as those in the occupied territories . Honestly I was expecting the templars to goose step in to battle while proclaiming " I vos only obeying orders " . It says something about the quality of director and cast when they can rise above such one dimensional scripting In short this is a film that is sometimes beautiful and stunning but often irritating , confused and plodding . It is well directed and acted but you often get the impression that it tries too hard and this works against it . Historians probably won't like it and you get the feeling no one will love KINGDOM OF HEAVEN and everyone will give slightly different reasons as to why they didn't love it . In short it's a very flawed masterpiece
469683	1532177	1061123	7.0	Fair Enough Story Which Will be Remembered For The Stunt Casting Rather Than The Plot	It seems that DOCTOR WHO has now become part of Christmas and I for one am glad of that . I always used to receive a DOCTOR WHO annual without for my Christmas as a youngster . Ironically enough a few minutes after seeing this Christmas I caught a snippet of CORONATION STREET where a child character was trying out their " human Dalek " mask seen in Daleks In Manhatten . It says something of the show's success when BBC merchandise makes an appearance in an oppositions show As for the episode itself it will be for ever remembered as " The one with Kylie Minouge " which isn't really a bad thing . Whilst being enjoyable this episode by Russell T Davies is far from original . I'm all for traditional ( read scary ) stories but basically it's a remake of the 1977 story Robots Of Death where instead of passengers being murdered by voc robots they're being murdered by robotic angels . Throw in some of THE POSIEDON ADVENTURE and you've got television by numbers . I shouldn't criticise too much because it was much better than the previous year's special and this episode got almost 14 million viewers making it the second most watched programme of the year - only the EASTENDERS episode the same day got more viewers !
468877	1532177	100403	7.0	Certainly Better Than Its Ill Deserved Reputation	PREDATOR 2 is a strange type of sequel . It doesn't feature any of the characters from the original movie which probably explains its box office failure . You can just imagine an audience squealing with delight when the studio let it be known there was going to be a follow up to the first film , only for the audience to weep in disappointment when they found out it was starring Danny Glover rather than Big Arnie . Sequels without the original characters never seem to do well as the recent 28 WEEKS LATER show ( It's a much better film than is given credit for ) but I think the producers deserve some congratulations for trying something different Certainly this movie gets off to an explosive start with the LAPD in a shoot out with a Latino drugs gang and it's safe to say that both the pyrotechnic and stunt team earned their money with this shoot . Like the original this is an action / adventure film and there can be no complaints that this is a boring movie . Stephen Hopkins directing may be slightly uneven but he does very well in some scenes such as the aforementioned opening , the metro sequence and the scene where a decapitation takes place overdubbed with the character's screams as his head is carried away . The violence may be more " ugly " in the words of Roger Ebert but I preferred this more than the comic strip violence of the original . My only real criticism is that the ending is rather flat compared than what went before All in all a rather enjoyable movie for those audiences who are in to action adventures and SF . It's a hugely under rated movie which people should judge for what it is rather than what it's not . Okay it doesn't have Arnie blowing away lots of bad guys but when you compare it to these dire ALIENS V PREDATOR movies it's actually quite good and hopefully now its reputation will go up slightly
470104	1532177	330093	7.0	I Laughed Out Loud	This BRASS EYE special PAEDO-GEDDON was swamped by complaints ( More on that later ) when it was broadcast in 2001 following a national debate around a possible " Sarah's law " following the abduction and murder of school girl Sarah Payne . In fact it's scheduling was delayed while Phil Collins took legal advice after he found out he'd been fooled by the show's maker Chris Morris into a starting a campaign entitled Nonce-senseIf truth be told this show is probably more remembered for the controversy than the content which is in very poor taste but I do confess that I laughed out loud . The edition centres around paedophiles and how society treats both them and their victims . Chris Morris plays the presenter who tells the audience that an infamous paedophile has been launched into space then confesses that an eight year old child has accidentally been placed into the capsule along with the paedophile . Cue the child's frightened screams . Like I said very poor taste Other highlights of the show include Dr Fox giving a scientific lecture that paedophiles share an identical nervous system to crabs ( " No one knows this but it's a scientific fact " ) Labour MP Barbara Follet giving a public warning about equipment paedophiles put on their genitals while surfing the net and Kate Thornton warning viewers that paedophiles can send gas through the internet which makes young children suseptable to sexual predators including one victim " Who was once a shy innocent child and who now has the sexuality of a sixty year old Colonel " . Morris also shows a police officer in the child protection squad a serious of photos wanting to know if they're classed as obscene . The photos included Barbie surrounded by a marital aids and a composite photo featuring a young boys head , a dog's body and an erect penis that could only have belonged to John Holmes . Hey I never said this show was tasteful did I ? It's impossible to mention PAEDO-GEDDON without the hypocritical fall out that surrounded it where politicians , childrens organizations and policemen rushed to condemn the show for making fun of a very serious subject . The show was poor taste despite me laughing all the way through it but it's a biting satire . Perhaps the critics should take a long hard look in the mirror where a liberal elite allows convicted paedophile slime to walk around the streets of Britain before they criticise a mere TV show for exacerbating tensions .
469492	1532177	100419	7.0	This Is Funny	I'm not a fan of comedies but any movie that starts with a scene of school children writing to their penpals with the following dialogue : " Dear Queen Elizabeth . How is England ? " " Dear Bishop Tutu . How are you ? " " Dear bow tie serial killer . I have all your newspaper articles " has something going for it , and the best thing about PROBLEM CHILD is the amount of very bad taste comedy . It's almost like a Farrelly Brothers comedy ( THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY , KINGPIN etc ) in both feel and execution . Okay so it's a goofy movie , okay some of the acting is poor , and okay you can see some of the jokes coming a mile away ( Oh a bear costume . I bet a real bear will turn up within the next five minutes ) but I watched it on TV one wet Sunday afternoon and had a few laughsI can't help thinking that the poor response from many forum members might be down to the fact that this was marketed as a " family comedy " . I can just imagine many parents renting this from the video store , taking it home and watching it with their cherubs only to find it features attacks on religion and family pets . I reckon Joe Stalin would have enjoyed this movie as much as I did
469828	1532177	364930	7.0	Michael Moore Would Learn Something From This Documentary	This is a documentary dealing with the appeal of Aileen Wuornos murder convictions . Don't worry I have no idea who she was either and it's only when I'm told that Charlize Theron played her in MONSTER that I discovered who she was . Try asking someone who Aileen Wuornos was and they'll give a similar blank response , and it's only with the words " Charlize Theron - Monster " that their memory will be jogged . Somewhat sad that an acting performance is better known than a series of real life crimes Nick Broomfield's documentary is black comedy of the highest order , he's worth a myriad of Michael Moores ' and lets the facts speak for themselves . Wuornos employed " Dr Legal " at her original trial , a man , or rather spaced out hippy , with no legal experience and no office who attended court after smoking as many as seven joints . I can respect Dr Legal as a toker but how on Earth was someone like that able to defend someone on multiple murder charges ? We're later shown someone claiming being gay is a very modern invention : " Where were the gays years ago ? " " In the closet ? " " No there weren't any gays years ago , they didn't exist back then . Were there any gays when you were at school ? " " I went to a British public school . We invented it along with the Greeks " Broomfield is very much anti death penalty and he's also very much against the cheque book circus that surrounded the case , but perhaps the beauty of this documentary is that despite being biased Broomfield doesn't feel the need to twist facts into lies or treat the audience as retarded schoolchildren , if you agree with the death penalty this documentary won't change your mind but does raise serious questions about the American legal system
469962	1532177	60177	7.0	I Still Like It	This seemed a very strange choice to broadcast on Remembrance Sunday . If you're foreign let me explain Remembrance Sunday is a day in the British calender where people lay wreaths at their local war memorial and hold a two minute silence in honour of the British war dead who died in the First World War and in conflicts since then . It's an official national event and a very solemn one . Somewhat strange that the BBC broadcast a war film featuring Germans as lead characters ! However THE BLUE MAX does contain some bloody sequences of First World War carnage so I guess it was an obvious candidate for broadcast I first saw this on television in the early 1970s and was impressed with it then . I'm still impressed with it now though with reservations . As several people have pointed out the story drags when the story switches to the adultrous affair between Bruno Stachel and his Baroness lover . It should also be pointed out that George Peppard and Ursula Andress are rather unconvincing in these scenes and seem to be playing characters in a romantic drama set in the 1960s than in the early part of the century . I hated these scenes when I first saw the film and I hate them thirty years later . I also can't help thinking this sub plot makes the movie slightly over long . Was it included to make the movie more marketable to a female audience ? If a movie features thousands of men sticking bayonets into each other no woman will be going to the cinema to watch the movie full stopThat's my only real criticism though there are one or two other flaws regarding historical facts and planes used , but lets look at the positive points . This the best film I've seen featuring First World War dogfights , when you see a movie like ACES HIGH etc it's painfully obvious that actors are sitting in front of some back projection but with the exception of one rather poor scene you can believe the cast are indeed flying their own planes , the arial battles are superb as are the battles on the groundThe cast play up to their characters in thinking they are 20th century knights fighting in an honourable and elitist way and though they're the other side it's impossible to hate them in anyway , and it's interesting to see James Mason playing a morally upstanding army officer in a role almost identical to the one he played in CROSS OF IRON . I guess it doesn't matter whose side your on because politics will win out in the end
468639	1532177	20708	7.0	Politically Incorrect Viewed Today	This is certainly the best of the shorts where Stan and Oliver play dual roles . Fair enough Stan plays Stan the child in much the same way as he plays Stan the adult but Oliver plays his child role in a slightly different way ( Almost like the kid at school who loves getting his fellow pupils into trouble off the teacher ) and it's a memorable change to see him without his moustache It's easy to work out that the primative technical challange of having Stan and Oliver appear was children was simply done by building an oversize set and having the duo dress up as children and it's interesting to note that apart from one short sequence ( Where the children are in bed so you don't get to see their faces in close up ) the adults and children never appear in the same shot . It's painfully obvious however that the mouse that appears is a badly animated effect Watching this in 2004 there's a lot of politically incorrect material which would have the do gooder brigade up in arms if it was made today . Children with airguns shooting at mice , a cat getting hit with a roller skate and worse of all an adult threatning to break childrens necks , but it is Stan and Ollie so we can forgive anything in one of the duo's best remembered and funniest shorts
469854	1532177	79082	7.0	I Can Certainly Relate To This . . . . . . .	. . . . . . . . . But before everyone phones the police to have me locked up in an asylum let me please explain that I had the " Neighbours from hell " living below me for over three years . Music would be turned on FULL BLAST below my bedroom at any time of the day or night . The music might get turned on at three in the morning and turned off at midday , it might get turned on at midday and turned off at three in the morning , I would never know when the music was going to get turned on when it wasn't being played and conversely when it was being played - And let me repeat it was FULL BLAST - I'd never know when it was going to be turned off . My life was a waking nightmare , a living hell . My landlords said " Oh nothing we can do , you'd better call the police " which is a euphemism for " We're not going to do anything because we're money grabbing parasites who are only interested in the rent - and don't forget to pay yours before the end of the month Mr Robertson " . I phoned the police but seeing as the neighbours turned their music off everytime they saw the police van driving up the road this was a waste of time - Not that the police seemed all that bothered about my trauma . And it was a trauma , so any film that deals with a man who has to put up with speed addicted freaks playing the theme to PETER GUNN at two O'clock in the morning is my type of movie . The only real difference between the character seen here and me is that I didn't kill anyone , I do confess I certainly wanted to but didn't . Oh and in this film the freaks making their neighbour's life a misery seem to take far less drugs than the ones who lived below me . There's actually a very good story trying to get out of this movie , but DRILLER KILLER is heavily weighed back by the technical aspects . The acting , despite not being the worst I've ever seen isn't all that good while aspects like cinematography and sound are very very poor indeed . To tell the truth it's an almost unwatchable movie , not due to the graphic violence but due to the very poor production values But DRILLER KILLER isn't a total flop . It feels more like guerilla film making than a video nasty , and it's certainly better than garbage like I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE and NIGHT OF THE DEMON . And I can't help feeling if it'd had a slightly more polished feel and a higher budget it'd be compared to the early works of Martin Scorsese
470380	1532177	1205437	7.0	Greatest Cliffhanger Ever In A Very Variable Self Indulgent Episode	Just to remind you how popular Nu-Who is I overheard a conversation between a couple of schoolgirls at a bus stop the week before this episode was broadcast " Dae ya ken what's happening on Saturday ? " " What ? " " Sarah Jane's coming back and Mickey and Rose's mum " Hey I thought to myself . Teenage girls think DOCTOR WHO is the most important and coolest show in the universe . Who says the youth of today have little hope ? It's astounding how much of a success the show has become . The only worry is would RTD throw a spanner in the works ? The answer is sometimes yes and sometimes no . Unfortunately the answer yes isn't a clear cut winner with The Stolen Earth Certainly RTD has pandered to the hardcore viewer weather they be middle aged men or teenage girls . The whole story revolves around continuity and nostalgia so much so that the narrative collapse beneath the weight of it . We see characters like Harriet Jones and the rhino monsters from Smith And Jones brought in to the fray only for them to disappear so abruptly you find yourself wondering was it really necessary to include them in the first place . Davros makes a welcome return and is shown to have embryo Daleks growing within himself but this is skated over so quickly you realise it's only been included because it seemed like a good idea at the time . Being an end of season story we have the obligatory cameos in the shape of Prof Richard Dawkins and Paul O'Grady and a plot line featuring the planet Earth on the brink of inevitable defeat . I for one would have been happier to have substituted nostalgia and spectacle and running around for a bit more drama as wehad in Bad Wolf / Parting Of The Ways The Stolen Earth does have some very good elements . Piper and Tate are both excellent in their roles so much so that it works against the rest of the female cast . Cribbens is also excellent whilst Julian Bleach as Davros is second only to the late Michael Wisher as the best Davros though his part remained underwritten . Undoubtedly though the best part of the story is the ending which contains the greatest cliffhanger the show has ever seen and I'm including the classic series in that equation . When a not so young man who has seen every episode that remains in the BBC archive says that his jaw hit the ground as the end credits came up you know you've been watching event television This is an episode that is wildly variable . The writing is patchy but that's only to be expected in 50 minutes of television that brings in continuity from the first four series of Nu-Who not to mention the two spin off series TORCHWOOD and THE SARAH JANE ADVENTURES and whilst not as talented as Joe Ahearne director Graeme Harper does the best with the material . If here's a fundamental problem it's mainly down to RTD as a producer who commissions his own writing . One hopes we shall see his autocratic type of producing end when he leaves the show
470245	1532177	289043	7.0	Very Good In Places But Ultimately Unconvincing	Long before I watched 28 DAYS LATER I had an online conversation with a couple of my cyber friends Jeremy and Riquez . Jeremy praised the movie thinking it was one of the best film releases in several years . I did point out to him the ridiculous idea that a virus with an incubation period of 20 seconds wouldn't be able to cause the type of havoc as featured in the movie . Riquez contributed to the conversation by saying " Theo you have no problem with rabid zombies but you find a virus with an incubation period of 20 seconds ridiculous ! " After finally seeing 28 DAYS LATER ( Thanks for the video Robin ) my reservations were confirmed , the audience can quite happily accept the concept of raging psychos tearing up the country destroying all in their path but the thought put into small details spoils the film somewhat ! ! ! ! ! SPOILERS ! ! ! ! ! Most of the problems lie in Alex Garland's script , it lacks depth , logic and internal continuity . Take for example the line where Selena tells Jim that the apocalypse was caused by something in the blood . How would she know this ? This is an example of characters knowing what's happening because the screenwriter does which is a mistake on Alex Garland's part . The reverse is also very true with characters being unable to work out things the audience has . Before seeing the movie I did have online conversations on the message board that a virus that takes 20 seconds to turn people into zombies wouldn't be able to spread world wide , indeed this is central to the plot and Sgt Farrell does state that " How does the infection spread across the oceans , mountains and rivers ? " and yet he's the only character in the story to draw this very obvious conclusion that only mainland Britain has been struck by rage . It would have been far less obvious if Selena and others had been totally ignorant as to the mechanics of infection As for the gaps in logic ask yourself this : If the soldiers want to keep Selena and Hannah as sex slaves why didn't they murder Jim as soon as they saw him ? I guess if they did we wouldn't have a story , but the screenplay is full of these niggling problems , like Jones and Mitchell getting into a fight so Jim can escape or West and Davies going to the barricade to kill Jim when they've got everything they need ( ie Selena and Hannah ) at the house . There's no reason for the soldiers to care about killing JimI also had a problem with the characterisation . Selena is shown as being tough as nails and totally ruthless at the start of the story and then needs rescuing by Jim at the end . Compare her to characters in say a John Christopher story where the protagonist starts off as middle class and mild mannered and ends up having to kill to survive . This is what happens to Jim but it seems a totally ridiculous character arc as he wipes out West's platoon . Jim has spent a month in a coma , has no military experience and manages to beat some squaddies who not only managed to survive mass attacks of the infected but had considerable battle experience before rage . I'm telling you Saddam must be kicking himself about not recruiting any bicycle couriers into the Iraqi army I will absolve Garland of any blame for the bizarre upbeat ending where Jim survives a bullet wound to the stomach and lives happily ever after with Selena and Hannah since the studio demanded a happy ending for their audience . Let's be honest here , the only ending that would have made sense is Jim dying and the two girls facing an uncertain future with rage turning into a pandemic holocaust I don't want to give the impression that I hated 28 DAYS LATER . I liked it a lot and will praise director Danny Boyle for making a tense and often very thrilling film . The use of digital video succeeds and the cinematography is breath taking especially the scenes set at the rain drenched roadblock where you can almost see every single raindrop falling pass the screen . The casting is somewhat uneven ( The French foreign legion isn't that cosmopolitan never mind the British army ) but mention must go to Ricci Harnett as Cpl Mitchell who plays one of cinema's most memorable thugs in a long time , Leo Bill might give an irritating performance as Jones but that's the way he's written , Naomie Harris is impressive where she's not let down by the script and the only real disappointment is Christopher Ecclestone as Major West who seems slightly miscast I gave 28 DAYS LATER but to be honest this should have been so much better . One can't help thinking Boyle would have been better off filming an adaptation of John Christopher's THE DEATH OF GRASS . As it stands it's a very good example of if a film is good it's because of the director . If it's bad it's because of the screenwriter
469856	1532177	219699	7.0	Haunting Thriller	I thought THE GIFT was going to be another of those clichéd tales involving a fortune teller , but as soon as the credits revealed that the director was the underrated Sam Raimi I suddenly started hoping that this was going to be a good film and my expectations were more than satisfied . Raimi is probably best known for his SPIDERMAN blockbuster and the EVIL DEAD films , but I can't help thinking he's far better suited to human dramas like this film and A SIMPLE PLAN . Part human drama on being an outsider , part court room drama , part whodunnit and part supernatural mystery THE GIFT could have ended up as an unfocused mess but Raimi pulls it off . A word too for Raimi's handling of the cast , all the performances are very good . As you'd expect from such a talented actress Cate Blanchet is excellent , but Keannu Reeves is a shock as a redneck scum bag . I won't go so far as to say he steals the show but as a confirmed Reeves hater I found his performance totally convincing . Praise indeed In terms of pace , intelligence and characterisation Billy Bob Thornton and Tom Epperson have written a very good script , but I have one genuine complaint regarding forensics . In the court scenes evidence is presented , but there is nothing regarding forensic evidence which does lead to a fairly big plot hole . If I remember correctly A SIMPLE PLAN also suffers slightly from the screenwriter not doing his homework regarding forensics . But I suppose I can forgive this because of a haunting and touching shock twist at the end . If you've seen THE GIFT you'll know what I'm talking about , if you haven't then I won't spoil it for you . The only problem with the twist is that after you've seen it the second or third time it's not as moving or touching as it was the first time
470020	1532177	120746	7.0	Old Fashioned Entertainment With That Has Little American Involvement	This gets off to a very impressive start where a trio of peasants are about to be executed on trumped up charges and Zorro appears to save the day . Normally I'd be rather uneasy seeing violence portrayed in such a knock about off hand manner but the action scenes in THE MASK OF ZORRO are something of an exception as the swashbuckling hero notches up an unlikely death toll against the military oppressors . It's all done with a panache as the audience are not asked but told to pick sides of good versus evil It's a very black and white morality tale , ridiculously black and white and oh so very old fashioned but I certainly did enjoy the way the story was told . It has a beautifully paced script that's packed with sword fights and acrobatics and amazingly I don't recall one single scene involving CGI . Are you listening Mr Hollywood producer ? You don't need CGI to make a successful Summer blockbuster , all you need are some film makers who know how to tell an enthralling story Perhaps I should point out that two of the lead actors are from Wales and that one is from Spain , along with the director being from New Zealand while the editor and cinematographer are British . Are these facts intertwined with my enjoyment of THE MASK OF ZORRO ? Certainly Hopkins , Zeta-Jones and Banderas bring their characters to life on screen and if big name American stars had been cast I think we'd have a rather inferior movie . Hopefully Hollywood producers can watch this - And LORD OF THE RINGS - and realise too much American involvement in front and behind the cameras can often be a bad thing . It's nice to see a movie like this where one of the main villains is an American
469456	1532177	59675	8.0	Entertaining And Exciting Examination Of Human Nature	There's some common ground with both ZULU and THE SANDS OF THE KALAHARI . Both were financed by Hollywood executive Joseph Levine , both were co-produced by Stanley Baker and Cy Endfield and Enfield scripted and directed both films which were distributed by Paramount pictures and both have South African locations . ZULU is rightly regarded as one of the greatest movies Britain has ever made ( For the sake of argument ZULU is a British movie regardless of its Hollywood involvement ) and airs on British network TV at least once a year . However SANDS is almost totally unknown . I saw it one afternoon about 15 years ago and until today that was certainly the last time it was broadcast . A pity because although I had very vague memories of it being good I hadn't realized how great it was until today . I was actually speechless after " THE END " caption came up on screen . This is every bit as exciting and entertaining as ZULU I would describe this movie as THE NAKED PREY meets 28 DAYS LATER . A strange combination I know but where as Alex Garland's script tried rather unsuccessfully to mix twin themes involving human nature and survival here Endfield's script explores how far human beings can go in order to survive . Monkeys are also important to the plot believe it or not ! Seeing as the script for THE NAKED PREY was Oscar nominated I can't help feeling that Cy Endfield was short changed at award ceremonies . THE NAKED PREY deserved its accolades but the script here is slightly more dramatic since there's more characterisation involved and there little digs at the human condition if you look closely enough you'll see lust , greed , ignorance and even the old excuse of " I was only following orders " come in for criticism . I would love to discuss the script in more detail but that would involve spoilers and I wouldn't want to spoil this movie for anyone who hasn't seen it . All I will say is . . . . WATCH THIS MOVIE IF YOU GET THE CHANCE . It's intelligent , exciting , very well paced and criminally underrated . The fact that this page and its related message board is composed mainly of people crying " Please release this on DVD " should tell you what a great movie this is
468911	1532177	86312	8.0	Compelling Drama	A common question to this movie is : If Karen Silkwood and her colleagues are so worried about being contaminated by plutonium at a processing plant then why do they smoke so many cigarettes if they're worried about their health ? Duh Because they volunteered to smoke ! They're adults and as adults they should be able to choose their own paths to hell . Even in 1973 the setting of this bio-pic everyone knew the risks of smoking related diseases and it's their health so if they want to ruin their health why should they be stopped from doing so ? ! ! ! ! MILD SPOILERS ! ! ! ! I don't know if it's irony on the point of director Mike Nichols but there does seem to be an awful lot of cigarette consumption in this movie . Certainly if there's any one wanting to give up the weed they should give this movie a miss . But the point remains that in 1973 ciggie packets carried government health warnings and everyone knew of the dangers even though they didn't want to admit it . Was the plutonium industry quite so honest ? What I liked about this collaboration between director Nichols and screenwriters Alice Arlen and Nora Ephron is that the audience is allowed to think for themselves on the issue of conspiracies and possible state sanctioned murders . Was Karen Silkwood bumped off for knowing too much and for being a trouble maker ? Possibly states the film but much of this is left somewhat ambiguous unlike say JFK by Oliver Stone . Likewise Karen's urine sample . Was it tampered with or was the radiation levels high because Karen was contaminated by a plutonium leak ? Once again the audience is left to make up there own minds Some people have criticized SILKWOOD because it feels very much like one of those cheap TVMs that even having a well known cast can't disguise . I won't disagree too much but this is because films of the period lacked much gloss and you can probably use the opposite argument in that nowadays Hollywood movies feature too much gloss and visual superficiality . Compare SILKWOOD with THE INSIDER or ERIN BROCKOVICH and make up your own mind if one's not glossy enough or the other two are too glossy to be effective . Certainly Nichols directs a scene where Karen walks through detectors and a jump cut occurs where she is undergoing decontamination procedure . I have no idea why but this scene shocked me to the core and this scene alone makes SILKWOOD a very memorable movie
468770	1532177	385705	8.0	Nick Love's First And Perhaps Last Great Film	An auteur is regarded as a director who has a running theme throughout their resume . For example Robert Aldrich is considered a " sadistic " director and whileis films may be tame compared to the video nasty era the likes of TOO LATE THE HERO and ULZANA'S RAID do still come across as compellingly blood thirsty and violent . The films of Martin Scorsese usually involve protagonists being caught in an existentialist quicksand where the more they try and find their goal in life the more they sink into a problem of their own making . Let's not get too caught up in the auteur theory however because much of it is simply down to movie studios assigning scripts to well suited directors " Hey Marty , we've got a script here featuring a deranged loner wanting to join the mob . Bob and Leonardo have already signed on the dotted line . You interested ? " . Nevertheless it's obvious that Nick Love in the years ahead will be honoured in this fashion if only because his films feature blackly comical stories of working class British males fed up with the state of the nation In terms of style and execution THE FOOTBALL FACTORY isn't a million miles away from the likes of TRAINSPOTTING and TWO SMOKING BARALLS . It's very quirky , rather episodic , fairly violent and oh so bloody entertaining . You could say it contains all the flaws of recent British movies like an overuse of the words " FAHKIN ' " and " KANT " but we are talking about the notorious Chelsea headhunters football hooligans and there are admittedly some unlikely coincidences involved such as two of the headhunters burgling a house that belongs to . . . but unlike Love's later OUTLAW you never feel at how contrived these plot twists are which probably says much of the film's entertainment factor . It could also be that the original source was strong in the first place since I get the feeling that Love totally fails as a screenwriter of original material , certainly the problem with OUTLAW was an underdeveloped script with very underwritten characters who lacked a recognisable motive . Here it's obvious but never overstated that the motivation of becoming a hooligan is to belong to something . And unlike in OUTLAW when something funny happens in THE FOOTBALL FACTORY you genuinely do laugh instead of scratching your head wondering if in fact it's supposed to be funny I have to confess that I've seen the feature films of Love back to front . I saw OUTLAW when it opened in the cinema in March , I saw THE BUSINESS a couple of months after that and saw THE FOOTBALL FACTORY for the first time last week . If Nick Love had released his films in that order then I would have said that here is a film maker who is really hitting his stride as his films just get better and better . Unfortunately what this means in reality is that Love is on a downhill curve and that nothing has come close to matching THE FOOTBALL FACTORY . One can only hope that the big screen remake of THE SWEENEY , a TV show well remembered for its mixture of black comedy and violence , will see a return to form for an underrated auteur
468526	1532177	91064	8.0	A Very Effective Horror Remake	Someone decides to remake a camp horror movie ? One thing's for sure and that's it's got to be better than than the original where a man who swaps heads with a fly walks about a house with head gear that looks like Michael Jackson's Blanket baby costume Hey I enjoyed this remake a lot and is certainly David Cronenberg's most mainstream movie . Like most successful horror movies ( HELLRAISER for example ) it confines itself to human elements like desire , hubris along with a love triangle and uses a limited number of locations in this case most of the action takes place in Seth Brundle's apartment . There's something present here that is totally lacking in nearly every horror movie of the 1970s and 80s and that's pathos , we feel sorry for Brundle as he has his genes spliced and starts to mutate into Brundlefly and in many ways the movie feels more like an update of James Whale's FRANKENSTIEN or a remake of THE WOLF MAN featuring an insect mutation instead of lycanthropy . This type of poignancy was absent from the 1980s where horror " heroes " were Freddy Kruegar who was an ethereal child molester killed by vigilante parents . That alone makes THE FLY unique . The final scene were Brundlefly emerges from the teleport after merging with metal and wants Veronica to end his suffering is a truly touching scene almost unheard of in the genre Being an 1980s movie means we're devoid of CGI and count your blessings for that because the make up here deserved throughly deserved the Oscar it won . True maybe some of the gore is excessive but the final transformation of Brundlefly is very impressive . Jaw dropping in fact . We also get to see undoubtedly Jeff Goldblum's best performance playing Seth Brundle in not a too dissimilar way that Tom Baker played The Doctor in DOCTOR WHO though it's fairly obvious that when Brundle does gymnastics it's a body double since the camera never focuses on Brundle's face . The supporting cast also play their parts as if they're in a serious film , especially Geena Davis which makes THE FLY an even more involving experience . If the actors believe in the story so will the audience An outstanding horror movie from a decade that featured nothing but teenagers getting sliced and diced by serial killers that couldn't be killed , and a horror movie that shouldn't be remade under any circumstances . What's that ? Hollywood have just started on a remake ? No doubt doubt we'll see Leonardo DiCario or Johhny Depp star in a movie bulging with CGI . I'll be going out of my way not to watch it
469344	1532177	41959	8.0	The Technical Points Make It A Classic	I can't help believing THE THIRD MAN is a film highly regarded because of its technical achievements rather than by its story . The plot itself is rather simplistic : American writer Holly Martins gets a message from his friend Harry Lime offering him a job in Vienna and when he arrives in the city he discovers Harry is dead . There's a mystery involved in how Harry died but because everyone is so familiar with the plot twists ( This film was made nearly 20 years before I was born ) there's no real surprises as to the story The film ( Can we describe it as " film noir " ? ) succeeds because of its breath taking technical achievements . from the opening shot we're shown a montage of shots of post war Vienna , some real life film footage , some specifically shot for the movie with a voice over that is breath takingly conversational . When ever a film opens with a voice over it's always done by some dour American but here it's said by some cheerful English chappie . This alone sticks out in the mind and clearly states that it's a ! ! ! ! ! British ! ! ! ! film . I don't mean a " British made film " financed with American money , I mean a film that was made by a British studio . Of course Carol Reed has an eye for an American market hence his casting of Orson Welles as Harry Lime and it's Welles casting that helps make THE THIRD MAN the screen legend that it is . He has very few lines but Welles speech about the cuckoo clock was ad libbed by the actor and is one of the most memorable lines in cinema . But for me the stand out aspect of the movie is the Oscar winning cinematography by Robert Krasker , it's impossible to think of this movie without thinking of shadows against walls There are a couple of flaws though . Considering Austria is in such a bad state after losing the war a couple of years previously I couldn't help noticing that scotch is freely available ! I know the black market is booming ( That's part of the plot ) but even so th way people reach for a bottle and pour themselves a stiff drink seems very unlikely , I mean how many people do you know that drink that amount of booze ? and we're in a period of time where strong liqueur is very easy to acquire . Can I just repeat that because the over familiarity of the story the plot holds no surprises ? Perhaps I ' , the first person to point this out by saying I don't like the score . Anton Karras plays the zither and after a few scenes I found myself being irritated by it
468912	1532177	94336	9.0	Brilliant Brit Comedy	Strange to believe that WITHNAIL AND I , a film that is regarded as today one of the best British comedies ever made flopped spectacularly on its initial release in 1987 and maybe it's not too easy to see why . In the late 1980s the British film industry was in an absolute mire and the very phrase itself " British film " made a homegrown audience roll its eyes and think of art-house crap directed by Derek Jarman or Peter Greenaway . Any British film no matter the genre or how good it was always got tarred with the same brush in those days . Years later actor Ralph Brown ( Danny ) was asked " Why is it a good film ? " to which he replied " Because there's no crap bits in it " which simplifying the truth . WITHNAIL AND I is a very rare type of British comedy since it has been developed to its utmost potential . All too often British comedies of the last 20 years feel like they've been rush released before the script has been used to its full potential but not with this comedy classic because nearly every scene couldn't possibly be any funnier . Everyone has their favourite scene like the one in the Irish bar or the tea room or the one with bull but for me the stand out scene has got to be the urine sample down at the police station . It's also interesting to note that it's a movie without any female characters and feels both homo-erotic and laddish at the same time . It also carries an emotional and poignant impact at the end , something all of us can relate to when our best friend finds a new best friend and we become quickly forgotten All the cast are excellent but Richard E Grant is nothing short of superb and it's probably his performance as much as Bruce Robinson's smart script . You could argue that because Withnail is a camp , self centered , mincing thespian Grant is playing an extension of himself and while this may be true he's certainly enjoyable to watch here . Ironically enough I'd have thought he'd be brilliant as the title character in DOCTOR WHO but it was co-star Paul McGann who got the role in the 1996 American TVM and what a major disappointment he was . As it stands both actors will probably be best remembered for their cracking roles in this movie
468381	1532177	75314	9.0	Explains What It's Like To Be Male	SPOILERS How would anyone be able to relate to Travis Bickle ? He's a freak show , a fantasist and a loner who watches porn films in cinemas with a cola in one hand and a candy bar in another and to all intents and purposes is an assassin and a stalker , but he also strikes a cord with any man who's been angry and young and rejected . He's an outsider that society has turned its back on : " Why won't you talk to me " is the heartbreaking question every young angry man screams at the world when he's very aloneScorsese directs Paul Schrader's low concept script on a shoestring budget - That's not a criticism , quite the reverse because this leads to a hyper-realism and it'd be impossible to think that a major Hollywood studio would produce something like this nowadays where everything is about making money while playing it safe : A character study of a disturbed loner ? 12 year old prostitutes ? Vigilante executions ? Too controversial , not enough explosions , not enough CGI . If there's a flaw in the screenplay it's at the end where Travis wipes out the pimp business and becomes a hero which left me confused . Doesn't society punish murderers even if they kill scum that use 12 year olds as prostitutes ? Even if he was cleared by the jury surely Travis would still have stood trial for murder ? but this is never referred to in the closing scenes , but I guess this is a comment on how society can quickly make a hero out of a villain and how a nobody can become the talk of the town , but still it seems to go against the grain of the script where we - Or at least the young males in the audience - recognise that an uncaring society is the villain where as Travis is the hero all along Despite the flawed ending of the screenplay ( Which is superb untill the last ten minutes ) this is still a movie masterpiece with Scorsese getting an acting tour de force from his cast . Jodie Foster as a child who sells her body on the streets of New York , a totally disturbing , brilliant performance , and DeNiro and Keitel in the same movie ! I've no idea if this is just hype but I heard all the stage schools in the USA were swamped at the time by applications from applicants in Compton , Hell's Kitchen , South Central and The Bronx who'd seen DeNiro and Keitel in the " I'm hip " scene ( A scene that was totally adlibbed by the actors ) and decided that acting could be cool and macho after all . As I said I don't know how true this is but the performances of these two actors has given a massive amount of credibility to the acting profession and it really is sad to see the DeNiro of today churn out so much garbage . This his greatest performance . I also rate it as Scorsese's best movie As a footnote may I recommend to all the angry young men reading this review to track down the albums of Matt Johnson aka The The especially the mid 80s albums SOUL MINING and INFECTED which have lyrics that could have been written by Travis himself . Matt is a great fan of Scorsese and it shows
