468817	1532177	372743	1.0	The Trouble With Democracy . . . .	. . . . Is that any idiot can cast a vote . Take THE 100 GREATEST MOVIE STARS OF ALL TIME yet another list show from Channel 4 . If we're talking about movie stars we're talking about movie stars from all eras of cinema , people like Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy , Spencer Tracy and Kirk Douglas none of whom actually appeared in the top 100 list That's bad enough but Ewan McGregor landed at number 9 ! What an actor who is only convincing playing an Edinburgh junkie is the 9th greatest movie star ever ! I'd thought maybe STAR WAR fans had stuffed the poll but that theory collapsed when I realised Alec Guiness didn't make the list . If McGregor deserves to be number 9 then the entire cast of EASTENDERS deserve to be in the top 50 somewhere . Kevin Spacey landed at the lofty heights of number 4 , another travesty . I will give some of the voters credit for NOT voting DeNiro ( Number 2 ) as the greatest ever movie star . Bob has shamefully let himself down by continually appearing in B movies for many years whilst the winner of the poll Al Pacino does give the impression he has some standards when it comes to appearing in films A very flawed list and I'm getting really fed up with these type of shows from Channel 4 . That's why I didn't vote in their meaningless poll
469766	1532177	300214	1.0	Utter And Absolute Garbage	As other people on this page have pointed out the plot for MORVERN CALLAR is thus : Girl wakes up to find her boyfriend has committed suicide . He leaves her his unpublished novel . She sells it . The end . There's hardly enough material there for a short film never mind a feature length movie and this fact becomes more and more obvious as director Lynne Ramsay fills up the running time with scenes that either outlive their usefullness by several minutes or are completely superflous in driving the plot . In fact that's the whole problem with the movie , the director is unable to inject any type of narrative drive to the proceedingsI could spend several paragraphs telling you how much I detested this anally retentive piece of art house crap but you get the picture so I won't bother you needlessly since unlike Lynne Ramsay I can get to the point . I will point out that MORVERN CALLAR has won awards which means nothing since " Former " terrorists have won the Noble peace prize and it's shocking a film this audience unfriendly was awarded funding
468998	1532177	117492	1.0	Galveston Oh Galveston	Apologies if the above summary doesn't tie in with the rest of the review but the title reminded me of the Glenn Campbell song . Truth be told singalonga Glenn was th only pleasure I got while watching this dire TVM . A black woman called Jordan decides to open a care home in order to make some money . Not a very exciting plot but it's difficult to explain how dire it all is because of many very slow scenes . Did I say it's dire ? Good because I want to spell it out for you - This TVM is D-I-R-E . The first third of the story features some of the slowest scenes ever witnessed in a TVM . The worst thing is these scenes usually end up going absolutely nowhere anyway so why were they included ? Strangely for a TVM we're treated to the " N " word , the " B " word and even the " O " word but this doesn't make THE ROAD TO GALVESTON a more eventful journey . The only positive thing about this TVM is that it points out that it's a very bad idea to let a drunk supervise senile old ladies but I guess everyone knew that same as everyone knows letting your kids spend the night at Neverland ranch can lead to dire consequences Number of times the word " dire " appeared in the above review - 5
468499	1532177	249238	1.0	Why Does Britain Bother . . . .	. . . to continually produce badly scripted movies ? Make no mistake , the core problem with THE WEDDING TACKLE is the screenplay . Didn't anyone notice before they started shooting that this film has no premise , no plot and is full of under developed characters ? As soon as the movie started I thought I was going to be watching some sort of bitter / sweet rom-com , then I thought I was going to be watching a bawdy sex comedy , then I thought I was going to be watching a comedy thriller , then I thought I was going to be watching a farce and all these conclusions took place within the first 15 minutes of the movie , which incidentally feels like it was made by a bunch of under talented film students . If people in Britain can't be bothered to develop a script for a cinematic release why should people flock to the cinema to see their movie ? " Anything else you want to warn us about Theo ? " Yes . You know the worst actor in Britain ? , the one from EASTENDERS who got shot by a bunch of daffodills in 1988 then returned to the show last year , you know the actor who's so wooden he only gives a good performance as a forest . Well he plays the villain in THE WEDDING TACKLE which that alone is reason enough to give this thoroughly unentertaining movie a miss " TAXI "
469044	1532177	66212	2.0	I Can't Believe The High Rating	Heist movies play out in an identical formula : Character A meets character B who introduces them to character C . They pull off a scam and it becomes a race for characters A , B and C to stab each other in the back The only difference between PERFECT Friday and other heist movies is that this one is possibly the worst directed one of the lot . Watch the scene near the start when Britt is introduced to Mr Hall in the bank . There supposed to be facing each other but by some ridiculous editing it looks like they're talking to each other's backs when the camera cuts between them . I also couldn't help noticing the poor sound editing which makes every interior scene sound like it was filmed in an empty room regardless of the location Even people who liked this movie mention Peter Hall's bizarre directing . I'm not mentioning it - I'm complaining about and helps make an already boring and unlikely story unwatchable , and I'm shocked that PERFECT Friday has an average user rating of 6 . 9
470188	1532177	281811	2.0	A Real Disaster Of A Movie	! ! ! ! ! MILD SPOILERS ! ! ! ! ! Suppose you were in deadly danger and needed to be totally anon , what would you do ? If you answered " Hide in a cave " you'd probably be right . If you answered something along the lines of " Become a singing sensation at a Las Vegas casino " then you'd probably be carted off somewhere to be force fed anti-psychotic pills . Alternatively you could also be invited to write a script . Guess what ? someone was invited to write a script and it's called DISASTER . Tracy is on the run from a Cult ( That's not a spelling mistake by the way ) and decides to hide out in Vegas as a star singer who's so famous her posters are plastered everywhere . Oh and she doesn't even bother to change her name , only her hairstyle . Do you think this is credible ? Can we expect to see a duo called Osama and Saddam singing The Desert Song at a downtown casino in the near future ? but who needs credibility when you've got Yossi Wein as director Yossi Wein directed such fare as DEATH TRAIN , US SEALS and OCTOPUS 2 so you know what to expect ie not much . If DEATH TRAIN resembled UNDER Siege 2 then DISASTER resembles the original DIE HARD except it's set in a casino , has little in the way of budget , with an unimpressive cast . It's also obvious the bad guy was written with a slimy limey actor in mind but couldn't get Rickman , Oldman or Bean ( Possibly because they saw the script ? ) so a plank of wood was cast instead . In fact I felt really sorry for Mr plank because there's so many flaming explosions in this film ( That's all there is in this movie - explosions ) and I was really worried he might get turned into charcoal Which reminds me the special effects of cars , helicopters and buildings going up in flames are obviously achieved by setting fire to toys - Some child is going to be very upset on Christmas day - while the more convincing . . . sorry less unconvincing effects seem to be stolen from other movies I think Despite all this I couldn't help noticing Tracy has a well developed pair of lungs so maybe her career as a singer isn't as ridiculous as it seemed at first . Tracy's lungs were the only reason I didn't off the TV
468618	1532177	132245	2.0	Makes THE FAST AND FURIOUS Look Like GONE WITH THE WIN	What did Sylvester Stallone do in order to be credited as writing the screenplay ? I was under the impression that there's no screenplay involved and certainly no story . All that seems to happen in this movie is that a young hunky racing driver called Jimmy drives round a racing track against a musical soundtrack , Jimmy gets out of car , music stops , Jimmy gives a moody look , blonde bimbo has something in her eye , Sly appears mumbles something and walks away , Burt Reynolds appear wearing a gray wig and shades looking like Davros from DOCTOR WHO , Jimmy plays computer game and gives a moody look , cue the music because Jimmy has spotted another blonde bimbo walking in slo mo , Jimmy looks very moody . Its like this all the way through as if director Renny Harlin has decided to make a pop video for MTV instead of a feature film . In other words it's film making of the most shallow order
469666	1532177	100975	2.0	Yawn	I hated the original XTRO but I did recognise there's something bizarrely unique about it and that it does have a cult following , but there's nothing unique about this " Sequel " it's just an ALIENS clone with only Paul Koslo treating the film with the contempt it deserves . In fact it's not even bad enough to be good which explains this very short review
469915	1532177	87222	2.0	Rather Nasty And Lacking In Character Development	Does anyone remember the alternative comedy show THE COMIC STRIP PRESENTS . One edition featured Charles Bronson ( Robbie Coltrane ) being interviewed about his new movie GLC : " It's about a man , an ordinary man whose wife and family gets wiped out by creeps and I have to hunt them down and kill them in a sadistic and graphic manner " " And after GLC what next for Bronson ? " " We're using a new angle . My family don't get wiped out but I go after creeps just the same " This accurately describes THE EVIL THAT MEN DO . It's a Bronson vigilante thriller where his motivation isn't down to a blood feud but this leads to credibility becoming strained Bronson is a retired hit-man who isn't giving up his retirement for anything until someone shows him a video tape featuring interviews with the victims of " The Doctor " , not the legendary time traveler but a infamous expert on torture . It's never really explained why The Doctor is so infamous since any police state has a myriad of these sadists nor is it explained why The Doctor and his sister have ridiculous English accents As you may guess it's a lazily written movie and incidents happening because the screenwriter needs things to happen to further the plot no matter how unlikely they are like one of the bad guys getting invited to a threesome so he can be killed or things being revealed like The Doctor's sister being a lesbian so some T & A can be included In many ways it's like one of those nasty Chuck Norris vehicles that were being released at the same time , but the most disappointing thing is that the director is also the same man who made ICE COLD IN ALEX and THE GUNS OF NAVERONE two very well regarded war dramas that are often shown on Sunday afternoons . Believe me this movie won't be shown until well after the watershed
469710	1532177	117992	2.0	Unlikable And Dumb	! ! ! ! SPOILERS ! ! ! ! Nice to see some of the comments on this page point out that TWILIGHT MAN falls apart if you think about it too much . I'm amazed that more people haven't pointed out the ridiculous amount of plot holes since this one very dumb movie Tim Matheson plays Jordan Cooper whose home is under secret survillence by Hollis Dietz ( Dean Stockwell ) who has managed to hack into every aspect of Cooper's life and there's no explanation as to how a computer hacker managed to get all these hidden cameras into Cooper's home , in fact it's insinuated that if you're a computer expert you can hack into an electric alarm clock and turn it into a close circuit TV . Wow Bill Gates must know the ins and outs of my life in that case So any way Cooper goes on the run after being falsely accused of murder with Dietz on his trail and we're treated to more and more unlikely events and dialogue one example being when Cooper needs information from a woman whose husband experienced the same thing she says " I'm sure you're a very nice young man " . Young man ? I looked up Mastheson's profile on this site and he was born in 1947 which makes him 49 years old when this movie was made which is hardly young . I guess the producers had a much younger actor in mind for the lead but no one bothered to modify the dialogue after Matheson was cast . There's also a ridiculous plot twist later one in the scene where Cooper spots a photograph of a woman who turns out to be his mother . The script is full of these unlikely coincidences , but perhaps the most unlikely event is when Cooper meets a woman on a train which leads to them getting a room together ( We'd all holiday in America if its women were that sociable ) and she asks him if he really killed his girlfriend . Cooper says he didn't and she believes him - Until news reports claim Cooper may be a serial killer and it's only then she phones the police which led me to ask why she thought he was innocent of one murder but not several others ? So we've got a dumb movie that is obviously inspired by THE FUGITIVE . I didn't like this movie at all due to umpteen unexplained occurances
468508	1532177	117663	2.0	A Bad Idea	The problem with THE SLAB BOYS is the limited appeal . It's based on a stage play - And boy does it show with its static locations - set in a Paisley dye factory in the late 1950s . I know Paisley fairly better than the majority of IMDB members because I used to shop there for clothes , but watching a film about a Paisley factory won't appeal to me , in fact I doubt if it'll appeal to anyone in Paisley . Not seeing through this flaw the producers tried to market THE SLAB BOYS as a musical by having " Hot " Scottish acts like The Proclaimers and Lulu do cover versions of songs from the 1950s for the soundtrack . So let me see the producers were hoping that teenagers would flock to the cinema to watch the film and then rush out and buy the soundtrack which features 50s pop songs by The Proclaimers and Lulu ? Teenagers ? The Proclaimers and Lulu ? I think I can spot a flaw in this cunning marketing idea I remember reading in the Scottish press that THE SLAB BOYS cost three million pounds to produce and only made a little over thirteen thousand pounds at the UK box office . The reason it made so little money is obviously because of its limited appeal , but unless you know a bit about film producing you'll be confused as to how it cost so much to make since it has only a few sets and a small cast . The answer to that is simple , most of the budget went on the copyright of having artists do cover versions of songs . The Proclaimers ? Lulu ? I'm sure they enjoyed their pay day
469845	1532177	118580	3.0	The Problem Is The Plot	A question for all you girls out there : If a man you've never met before accidentally phoned you up on purpose and continued to do so at the most indiscreet moments would you be intrigued by him or so freaked out you'd phone the police ? Yeah that's what I thought so I couldn't swallow the idea of Marti Gerrard putting up with the unwarrented attention of Connor Hill MILD SPOILERS This is a really dumb story . Connor Hill's wife is murdered and the plot revolves around the question is Connor phoning Marti so he can have an alibi ? But there's a massive gap in logic here , couldn't Connor have employed a hit man ? something the prosecution seem to have ignored . And wasn't there any forensics at the murder scene ? So why does the whole trial rest on Connor phoning Marti at the time of the murder ? Dumb . Dumb . Dumb . And it's as predictable as it is brainless . My abiding memory of this film is that for someone who made the winter Olympics Marti Gerrard is a really crap downhill skier
468383	1532177	217370	3.0	Avoid	THE TOM BAKER YEARS differs very much from the previous three YEARS tapes , all of Baker's episodes existed in the BBC archives unlike the William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton eras ( Which was the original idea behind the Hartnell and Troughton YEARS tapes ) so here we see Tom Baker commenting on a clip from every story he starred in . You could vaguely describe this as a precurser to the commentary tracks used on present day DVD features but that would probably be too kind as I get the feeling it was released just to fleece DOCTOR WHO fans . The clips shown are more often than not poor choices with a clip from Genesis Of The Daleks being devoid of any Daleks or their creator Davros while The Invasion Of Time clip doesn't feature the Sontarans who are one of the most popular villains from the series . Worst of all THE TOM BAKER YEARS was released on a two tape set costing £20 when it could have easily have fitted on a single tape for ten quid Baker makes a gives a few anecdotes and has a dead pan sense of humour , but often he fails to remember details or names of stories , forgets the name of aliens and even fails to recall the name of one of his assistants ( She's called Leela ) which leads me to believe it's a tape designed just to cash in on the show's popularity amongst die hard fans . It's worth watching if you can borrow a copy for free but I'd certainly avoid paying money to see it
468496	1532177	140743	3.0	Truly Awful	This starts out with an alien spaceship being found during the blizt , a homage to QUATERMASS AND THE PIT no doubt but as the series progresses it comes more as an insult than a homage . I rate Nigel Kneale as television's greatest ever writer and QUATERMASS AND THE PIT as the greatest drama ever to have been transmitted under the telefantasy banner and to have INVASION EARTH pay homage in this way is an obscenity . INVASION EARTH is possibly the worst telefantasy series ever made by the BBC . It is truly awfulThe script is responsible , the opening episode features so many coincidences in order to bring the characters together it looses all credibility , but after the first episode it gets worse , concepts like the NDs ( They're the bad guys from another dimension I think ) polluting the water supply and kidnapping humans in order to carry out experiments on them are underdeveloped and badly explained while entire episodes are padded out with the subplot of a Second world war army officer's journey through the galaxy with a race of good aliens . All this is unnecessary to the plot , at least I think it is because I'm not sure what the plot is , describing the plot of INVASION EARTH is like describing the plot of a James Bond film , lots of things happen but none of it adds up to much . In which case I'll say in INVASION EARTH not much happens and none of it makes much sense . Truly awful
469890	1532177	87051	3.0	Doesn't Hold Up To Repeat Viewing	I remember first seeing this in 1980 as part of THE HAMMER HOUSE OF HORROR series and everyone was talking about it at school on Monday . I saw it for a second time last night and to be honest it's not much cop . It's just another predictable story of a newly wed couple getting lost and spending the night at a creepy mansion that's owned by a woman with a west country accent and being a horror story it's always bad news to spend a night at a mansion owned by someone with a west country accent Two things I noticed about watching it for the second time : First up is the very poor budget . Unless I'm imagining it there only seems to be one set used and the set designer hides this fact by using different furniture scene to scene ( I might be wrong of course ) while the werewolf make up is absolutely laughable . Secondly watching it a second time you can't fail to notice how predictably it all plays out . In many ways the story is structured like a whodunnit and just like any whodunnit it's only worth watching once at most
469757	1532177	117608	3.0	Bad Idea	When I say " Doctor Who " you might conjure up an image of Tom Baker , or Jon Pertwee or maybe Peter Davison . When I say " James Bond " you'll almost certainly conjure up an image of Sean Connery while a small handful of people may think of Roger Moore or Pierce Brosnan . But when I say " Sgt Bilko " absolutely everyone will think of Phil Silvers . Unlike Doctor Who or James Bond the role belongs exclusively to one actor . And that's the problem with this film version you'll continually wish you were watching the old black and white show . In fact the whole idea of making a film version of BILKO without Silvers in the title role comes close to sacrilage
468687	1532177	120847	3.0	Seen It All Before	Hey a tough mercenary goes undercover as a teacher to gain revenge on a tough gang who are running drugs ! Where have I seen that movie before ? Hey I saw the exact same plot in a movie called THE SUBSTITUTE with Tom Berenger going into a tough inner school to wipe out a drugs gang . In fact both plots feature the new arrival going into class and telling the kids about ' Nam . If there's any difference between the movies it's that the sequel is even dumber than the original How dumb is it Theo ? Well for a start we see a tough gang of black kids wearing hoods similar to the KKK ! I'm just thinking that any homies dressed like the Klu Klux Klan might make themselves very unpopular with other gangs in the ghetto . But it gets dumber believe it or not . The gang tries to kill a girl then after they've killed someone else they drive off leaving the girl alive to become a possible witness . Later on the cops drive past and it's only then that the gang decide to try and kill the hero . I've never tried to bump anyone off but surely it's a bad idea to shoot someone when the cops are at the other end of the street ? As you can expect in these type of movies none of the cast will be nominated for Oscars , but it's a shame that Berenger couldn't reprise his role since Treat Williams isn't much of a treat in the acting stakes . I'm also very sorry to pick on one of the cast by name but Susan May Pratt as Anya Thomasson is absolutely abysmal , she is totally wooden and mumbles her lines like she's reading out a shopping list . The only half way decent acting comes from some of the gang members , but how difficult is it to play foul mouthed gangsters ? I hope no one picks me up wrong but the only positive thing I can say about SCHOOL'S OUT is that the director has cast all black actors as gang members . How many movies have seen featuring a tough ghetto gang that is one third black , one third white , and one third Latino ? Too many would be the answer and some congratulations are in order for not taking a PC view of ethnic composition of gangs . It should also be pointed out many of the victims of this gang violence are black themselves so at least this aspect rings true . But if you want a realistic movie you might want to miss the bell for THE SUBSTITUTE 2 : SCHOOLS OUT
468942	1532177	265944	3.0	Name That Source	One minute into THE UNTOLD and it's already ripped off techniques from THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and PREDATOR . Does this mean we'll be seeing lots of trees ? We sure will . Will we be seeing an Austrian bodybuilder blowing things up ? Well this film has the budget of a TVM so the answer is a resounding no . Does anyone like these soft porn shows like BEDTIME STORIES ? Good because there's a scene in this that resembles these type of shows . Unfortunately the only thing you see is cellulite . Do you like it when the screen fades to black during a TVM ? Great because this happens between every scene in THE UNTOLD . In fact it happens during every scene too . Did you enjoy MILLIONAIRE - A MAJOR FRAUD ? Fantastic because one of the characters looks like a bearded Major Charles Ingram the contestant who tried to swindle the show out of one million pounds . Seriously one of the characters looks like Major Ingram . I kept expecting him to say " It's bear . It could be a bear . But it might be a bigfoot < Cough , cough > , yes it's a bigfoot < Cough > , it's definately a bigfoot < Cough > Yes I'm going to shoot it . Final answer Chris " Oh and have I mentioned that all the above are the good bits ? THE UNTOLD isn't the worst bigfoot movie I've ever seen , that accolade firmly goes to NIGHT OF THE DEMON which I saw over twenty years ago and I think I've only seen less than a dozen films that are worse in all of that time . But that said THE UNTOLD is still a very poor film in just about every aspect , especially editing . As some other reviewers have pointed out it feels like whole chunks of the film are missing while there's other bits where scenes are spliced together in the wrong order . This is a really bad film that deserves far less than its rating of 5 . 1 . I give it and I'm being very kind
469839	1532177	153464	3.0	Very Boring	UP AT THE VILLA fooled me into thinking I'd be watching something similar to GOSFORD PARK . The film opens at a ballroom in 1930s Italy which is populated by vulgar Americans and uptight upper class Brits , but in truth UP AT THE VILLA plays out far more like a Merchant - Ivory production which is very bad news because it's a very slow , and I do mean very slow romantic drama with some of the romance being very unlikely . If you like slow romantic dramas you might like this movie . I didn't
468602	1532177	266000	3.0	It's Not High Concept	Roberta , a Hollywood director bangs her head and finds herself in Sherwood Forest in ye days of olde where everyone she knows in Hollywood is duplicated . This plotline instantly reminded me of the 1970 DOCTOR WHO story Inferno where the Doctor finds himself in an alternative universe where everyone he knows back on Earth is duplicated as a fascist alter-ego . However while Inferno was a telefantasy plot at its very best VIRGINS OF SHERWOOD FOREST is a soft core porn film so we can forget all about phrases like " Convincing location in Nottinghamshire " and " Good acting performances " and boy can we forget all about " High concept plot " because it's a soft core porn film . We should also forget all about anachronisms like silicone implants and thongs in ye days of olde , but at least the actresses Gabriella Hall , Shannan Leigh and Amber Newman are very fit so no complaints from me
469326	1532177	124298	3.0	I Know It's A Comedy . . . .	. . . . But couldn't the central idea of having naive people from the early 1960s finding themselves in the cynical 1990s have been better thought out ? They thought there was going to be a nuclear war so they hid in a nuke proof bunker for decades ? Does anyone see a flaw in this ? The film does try and explain how they'd be able to eat fish for the next 35 years but come on three people spending 35 years in a bunker ! Strange that they enough nappies , enough toilet rolls and enough everything to last 35 years . Strange that the workmen never though about digging up the septic tank either isn't it ? How very convinent for the plot . Perhaps if the characters had walked into a plot device called a " timeslip " I might have been more convinced Of course I'm being very cruel in pointing out the unlikely set up and BLAST FROM THE PAST isn't a total loss . Brendan Frazer does play the innocent abroad with a touching infectious innocence and everyone gives good enough performances but this movie feels too much like it was made by Tim Burton , the director isn't Burton it's Hugh Wilson who should have perhaps concentrated on making his own movie instead of apeing Burton's style
468605	1532177	116723	3.0	Guilty Of Being Utter Crap	It's funny how instinct warns you of something . For example as soon as the company credits read Nu Image I knew instinctively I'd seen a really crap film by them somewhere before but couldn't remember where . Nevertheless I just knew JUDGE AND JURY was going to be crap and it was . Maybe I'm psychic ? ! ! ! ! MILD SPOILERS ! ! ! ! The opening is rather violent with several people getting blown away for no more reason than being in the wrong place at the wrong time . I don't know about you but I'm geting slightly fed up with exploitive violence onscreen nowadays along with bad language , especially if it's spouted by actors as bad as the ones in this movie . Anyway the plot revolves around the bad dude getting executed and coming back to reek revenge on the man who shot his wife . Oh did I mention the bad dude and his wife murdered a couple of people on their wedding night ? Yeah he's a serious badass mofo . In fact he's so bad ( And I don't mean the acting - I'll get to that in a moment ) that he's impossible to take seriously and this is before he's executed only to return as Elton John , Elvis , a French chef etc . I wonder if Keith David got paid for this ? because he looks lke he's having so much fun on screen that's the only reason he's playing the role . What a pity this reviewer didn't have any fun whatsoever watching JUDGE AND JURY . Hey maybe the producers could send me Keith's fee ? Gawd only knows I deserve it . I disliked this movie a lot as if you hadn't guessed and my main beef isn't with the stupid plot or the cheap production values but with its attitude to violence . If like me you've had a wine bottle cracked over your head or been kicked in the ribs very hard several times you'll know violence is an obscene painful thing , but JUDGE AND JURY will have you believe that if you're thrown through a window , crash through some bannisters and fall twenty odd feet onto a table not only will you be unhurt but you'll be able to outrun a couple of rabid devil dogs . It could of course be argued that any film starring Sly , Arnie or Bruce also suffers from this same dishonest showing of violence but with JUDGE AND JURY it yanked my chain
469754	1532177	128239	3.0	Shouldn't This Be A Comedy ?	! ! ! ! ! POSSIBLE SPOILER ! ! ! ! ! You'd think a story involving Archie Grey Owl - An Englishman posing as a red indian - would have a massive amount of humour involved . In fact I'd say the only way to treat a film like this where a remarkable man cons the gullible public is to treat it as a comedy . However Richard Attenborough commits something akin to a crime by making GREY OWL a serious drama . Worse , he's made an extremely dire film too . Pierce Brosnan lacks the charisma needed for the title role and the romantic subplot between Grey Owl and Pony ( Played by the equally wooden Annie Gaupeau ) lacks any type of on screen chemistry . But to be fair to the cast their not helped with the script which fails to portray Archie as the cheeky chappy he is of fooling everyone into believing he's a native American . The producers and screenwriter have made the major error of having the film centre around the plot twist of Archie being an Englishman - That's why I wrote " Possible spoiler " it's not actually revealed untill late in the film that the title character is English , but it's obvious that everyone who viewed this movie knew that beforehand hence there's absolutely no surprise involved . Yes I do agree with everyone that the scenery is lovely and that it has a deep ecological message which isn't actually a new concept . Theodore Roosevelt was the first important environmentalist of the 20th century if truth be told . And it should also be remembered that with the exception of SOYLENT GREEN ( And possibly THE TWO TOWERS if you want to class it as having a green message ) that there hasn't actually been a great ecological film . In fact most environmentally concious films suck and that includes GREY OWL , a film that unsurprisingly had a serious problem in finding a distributor

If I was a presenter I would have described as a big pile of art house crap but " Derek Jarman meets David Lynch " is the same difference . I've nothing against art house horror , I thought THE ADDICTION was okay while I loved the visual style of THE KEEP but there has to be a limit and NADJA goes way beyond that limit and ends up unwatchable for those of us who aren't obsessed with pretentious nonsense The story follows eponymous vampire Nadja who steps foot in America in a bizarre remake of DRACULA'S DAUGHTER . Everything in the narrative is sacrificed for the visual style and more often than not it's impossible to understand what the hell is going on since the picture fades to pixellated shots that are out of focus , cross fades , slow motion sound fade outs and other directorial tricks from Michael Almereyda . No doubt the director thought he was being clever but it makes the story unfathomable and isn't helped by some very poor performances indeed . It's impossible to believe that any of the cast - Including Peter Fonda - are professional actors A very poor film that will only appeal to art house junkies and if it wasn't for the great soundtrack by Portishead , My Bloody Valentine and The Verve this steaming pile of ostentatious excrement would have received even less than
468921	1532177	242798	3.0	Not What I Expected	Former brat pack actor and all round pretty boy Rob Lowe stars in a film set in a high security American prison . I had a gut feeling his character was going to be popular for all the wrong reasons like Tobias in the first series of OZ , but PROXIMITY isn't that kind of film , it's more like a " Man on the run " film like THE FUGITIVE . It also makes a nod to the themes of punishment and justice with James Coburn putting in a cameo as the spokesman for a justice for victims pressure group but any intelligent discussion on how society should treat criminals is completely ignored as the film degenerates into tired old cliches of shoot outs and car chases
469356	1532177	73812	4.0	Oh It's A Musical	I remember the first time TOMMY was broadcast on British television on BBC 2 in the late Autumn of 1981 . For the first time ever Radio 1 did a simultaneous broadcast , the idea being you turn off the sound on your TV , turn up the sound on Radio 1 and you'll be able to watch TOMMY in stereophonic sound , bare in mind this was before we had widescreen TVs that broadcast stereophonic sound , everything we got on TV in those days was in mono Instead of watching the movie on TV I listened to it on Radio 1 . I knew the movie was a musical but was under the impression it'd be something like Jeff Wayne's WAR OF THE WORLD album where there's a clear narrative with dialogue along with musical tracks , I mean Robert Powell , Oliver Reed and Jack Nicolson aren't singers right ? I listened to the film and it was about ten minutes before anyone started singing and within 20 minutes I had no idea what this was about , it was people singing , no dialogue , no narrative , no nothing so I decided to turn off the radio and go to sleep . Strangely when I was at school the next day everyone was saying what a weird though thoroughly entertaining movie it was And finally seeing the movie last week I can understand in some strange way what a subversive movie this is . Ken Russell doesn't hold back on the weird factor . Take the scene where Eric Clapton is performing in a church and everyone is worshipping a statue of Marylin Monroe and there's people wearing masks of her waving bowls of incense around . Mind if I ask what that's all about ? On second thoughts don't . That actually sums up the strengths and weaknesses of TOMMY , the imagery is strange , sometimes utterly compelling and breath taking like the sequence in Amazing Journey where a pin ball randomly smacks bombers turning them into crosses of rememberance but more often than not the film makes just as much sense as it did when I listened to it on the radio more than 20 years before . There's a vague point that musical heroes are somewhat Hitlerite in our modern pop culture but the very similar THE WALL by Pink Floyd makes this point far clearer and if truth be told THE WALL is by far a better movie and album Anyone else feel uneasy that much of TOMMY revolves around a young child from source material by Pete Townshend ?
469272	1532177	290334	4.0	" Something's Wrong " - Yeah The Script	SPOILERS I wasn't all that taken with the original X-MEN movie but since it was the introduction of a franchise I forgave the flaws like the underdeveloped themes of antagonism between the humans and mutants . X-2 has no such excuses however since the plot revolves around Magneto and a rogue human general trying to start a war between the humans and mutants . Well I used the word " Plot " but just like in a Roger Moore Bond film or a typical Hollywood summer blockbuster the plot gets drowned out by explosions , stunts and special effects It's here I wish to absolve the screenwriters for most of the blame of a muddled underdeveloped story because I can imagine the screenplay being repeatedly returned to the writers with a note saying " Okay Jean and Wolverine are in love but there's not enough teen romance so introduce a couple of teen characters " and " The boys at special effects have come up with a new morphing effect so write a few scenes where we can show it off " Note to Hollywood studios - If you think writing a screenplay is so easy try writing one . Then after you've done that write another one and anotherRegardless of the pressure they were under there is a couple of things the writers are guilty of and that's the mutants using their special powers to escape from a tight spot . F-16s on the tail of the escaping X-Men , I bet Storm can conjure up a few twisters . Yup thought so and this type of cheating takes place far too often but the fundamental error lies in a way a character is killed . If Jean dies at the end of the film it's logical that Jean should be the focus of the story but for some reason it's Wolverine who's the focus for much of the story which is a blunder on the part of the screenwriters So I wasn't too keen on this sequel at all and as recent blockbusters like LORD OF THE RINGS and THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL show a good memorable fantasy adventure is down to a script that allows good actors to act and have special effects that arise naturally from the story . Cramming a film with special effects just isn't enough any more
469354	1532177	83511	4.0	A Buddy Movie	Buddy movies were very popular in the 1980s , less popular in the 1990s and non existent at the turn of the century . I think the reason they're non existent these days is that it's a genre that is very , very limited as anyone who has seen more than a very small handful of buddy movies can testify . It all comes down having a hard boiled cop matched up with a contrasting character and there you have it 48 HOURS is better than most simply down to the fact that it was a fairly original idea at the time and where the movie works best is with the violent thriller element . Some of the violence is quite shocking down to the fact that it's so cold blooded . Take the " Nice gun " scene which is an uneasy scene to watch down to the cold calculating way the violence is dispensed . A murder scene doesn't have to gory for it to be disturbing , something that I hope directors will take note of Where the film is less successful is when it's trying to be amusing . I do confess I've always disliked Eddie Murphy down to the fact that he always seems to play the same wise cracking urbane black dude in every movie he's appeared in and here he's every bit as irritating as every movie he's been in . Oh and did I spot a blunder where Murphy and Nolte's characters are introduced at the prison cell block ? Nolte's cop asks Murphy's con to help him find a fugitive - Right in front of a crowded prison wing and Murphy agrees ! I was under the impression that if anyone did that in real life they'd get capped by the inmates before they left the gates . Failing that they'd be watching their back for the rest of their life on the outside , no one likes a prison stoolie How much you enjoy 48 HOURS comes down to how much you enjoy buddy movies . I enjoyed it in parts but as some people have already pointed out you can get too much of a good thing
470339	1532177	66549	4.0	A Complete Mess	This has got to be one of the worst directed epics I have ever seen . Moments into the movie we see an almost sublime jump cut close up of Napoleon's eye as he talks to his right hand men . I've no idea what this was to signify . I guess that perhaps director Sergei Bondarchuk was a fan of spaghetti westerns And as the film goes on the more I found myself asking what the hell the director was doing . Did Mr Bondarchuk ever read a history book ? Did he ever read ANY book . Come to think of it have the people who are praising the movie at this site been watching the same movie as me ? There's several films called WATERLOO and I'm commentating on the one starring Rod Stieger as Napoleon and Christopher Plummer as the Duke Of Wellington - I've no idea what what everyone else has been watching because this is only slightly accurate script wise - totally inaccurate visually . For example Wellington picked his ground well after a rain storm to lessen the effect of French cannon fire ie the wet ground would cause cannon balls to stick in the ground but according to this movie not only did French cannon balls explode like a bomb but they also exploded into fire balls . Look at the battle scenes where there's literally hundreds of fireballs from cannon fire , it looks more like a napalm strike from APOCALYPSE NOW rather than a great battle from 1815 . Let me just repeat that cannon balls in those days were made out of solid metal . They weren't filled with explosive so they didn't explode and jellyfied petrol ( Napalm ) hadn't been invented yet so no fireballs either I also can't help noticing how badly edited the fight scenes are . In fact they resemble those seen in the John Wayne debacle THE GREEN BERETS and it's often difficult to make out what's going on . If you're going to have a spectacular battle might it not help that the audience can see what's happening ? I've got to be pedantic and criticise the numerous times the red coats are called " The English Army " , it's actually The British Army . Considering there's umpteen times Scottish bagpipes are heard I thought someone would have realised there's a difference between the two . Oh and the British Army was led by the Duke Of Wellington on that day who wasn't an Englishman as referred to here but was in fact Irish born
468753	1532177	329954	4.0	Effective Enough Soft Core Flick	With a title like 13 EROTIC GHOSTS I was under no illusion what sort of film I'd be watching - A rather threadbare plot revolves around a bunch of supernatural investigators finding out about ghostly happenings after a girls school is struck by lightening and burns down in a special effects sequence that wouldn't look out of place in the cheapest DOCTOR WHO production As you can imagine this threadbare plot is just an excuse to show some lesbian love action and despite the sex scenes not being up to the erotic standard of ALLYSON IS WATCHING the sex scenes are fairly good for this type of genre though to be overly critical there's maybe not enough boy on girl action 13 EROTIC GHOSTS doesn't take itself too seriously and does contain this memorable exchange : " You know she reminds me of my old Co in ' Nam . Iron underpants we called him " " Maybe we should call her Iron implants ? "
468387	1532177	91859	4.0	Crude British Sex Comedy	This is a strange sex comedy because there's very little comedy but a whole lot of sex , most of which takes place in the back of a car and is so graphic it makes BASIC INSTINCT look like an edition of TELETUBBIES . I kid you not , the sex in this film is so in your face it might just choke you , especially if you're watching with your grandparents . As for the rest of RITA , SUE AND BOB TOO there's not much else worth mentioning except the language where every single sentence seems to contain the F word . This a rather bleak hyper-realist British film made at a time when Channel 4 was the main investor in British movies which explains its made for television low budget feel
469987	1532177	126886	4.0	Something Of A Misnomer	This movie is called ELECTION and right from the outset I had it in my head that this movie might actually be about an election . It is to an extent premisewise featuring a little miss know all perfect running as school president but it's also a black comedy and as legendary film school guru is fond of telling his students you never ever market a screenplay as a black comedy because it's the one genre no one can define , " Black comedy " can mean absolutely anything and watching ELECTION unfold I wasn't too sure if the producers were certain if they knew where this movie was heading either . For example the storyline is overwhelmed by too many characters . These characters are often given little background stories via a voice over but more often than not these characters are superfluous to the plot , or at least the premiseBelieve it or not I though ELECTION had too much sex in it . Again this is probably down to the producers who seem to want to turn the movie into a sex comedy which affects the mood of the movie at times . The sex also tends to make the characters unlikable since they're all getting their fair share . Considering this is a movie made for a teen audience how many teenagers in the audience do you believe will be able to empathise with characters getting lots and lots of sex ? Perhaps ELECTION could have done with another title ? Something along the lines of ELECTION , BUT MANY PARTS ARE Unfocused AND THE CHARACTERS ARE VERY UNLIKABLE . IT DOESN'T REALLY WIN MY VOT
468729	1532177	118172	4.0	Some Serious Flaws	Does anyone remember that television series from the mid 1980s featuring the characters from WIND IN THE WILLOWS ? That's the series featuring fine actors like Michael Hordern and David Jason voicing the characters who are represented as puppets . It was a superb series according to my memory and this cynical reviewer would probably still sit down to watch it if it was on television today This live action version of WIND IN THE WILLOWS collapses on many levels more so if you've seen the aforementioned series . First of all the big name cast fail to resemble lovable fluffy animals in any way and it's very easy to forget why they're called Mole , Badger , Toad etc so instead of humanising animals ( A traditional concept in childrens fiction ) Terry Jones has done the opposite and animalised humans . It's very irritating the way the cast tend to mug for the audience at every opportunity which does gives the feeling the film is talking down to the child audience , and whose big bad idea was it to include songs ? This ruins the appearence of the story's villains - the weasels which totally contradicts story convention of always having the bad guys treated seriously . No matter what genre you're writing the bad guys must always be treated with respect . If the writer doesn't take the bad guys seriously there's no way the audience can either . Imagine a James Bond movie where the evil mad man who wants to take over the world is played by Jim Carrey doing his usual Jerry Lewis on acid spiel . That's how menacing the weasels are in this movie , a movie that wears out its welcome very quickly
469368	1532177	117826	4.0	At Least It Didn't Take Itself Seriously	I've never seen an edition from TALES FROM THE CRYPT so I can only judge BORDELLO OF BLOOD by its own merits and I'm afraid I don't have much opinion one way or the other . It's a camp horror movie featuring a brothel that's a front for vampires and instantly reminded me of FROM DUSK TILL DAWN but is slightly more enjoyable . It doesn't take itself too seriously which works in its favour other wise I'd be pointing out plot holes like how come the cops haven't noticed that many of the town's male inhabitants have been going missing . I could have done without the sexual innuendo and wise cracks though " I think you'd better step outside " " No thanks I don't have time for a < Sexual act > " Not sure if I'd be watching the TV series on a regular basis after watching this feature length spin off
469287	1532177	95774	4.0	Running On Empty	It's obvious that by 1988 the Vietnam war film had nothing more to say . From the pondering self pity of THE DEER HUNTER to the cruel humour of FULL METAL JACKET the sub genre had burnt itself out in a similar manner as napalm had burnt out the jungles of South East Asia . SAIGON ( As it's known in Britain ) doesn't make any pretence at bringing anything new to Hollywood's love affair to the ' Nam and tells us nothing we didn't already know : War is hell - Check The South Vietnamese regime wasn't worth the life of one GI - CheckAll US colonels are crazy - Check SAIGON doesn't really feel more than a gimmick film , the gimmick being that it's a murder mystery set during the war in Vietnam . I should also point that the murder plot is very unconvincing , especially so in the last ten minutes where the murderer is revealed and it becomes a race against time to save his victim . If you want to see either Willam Defoe or Scott Glenn in a movie masterpiece rent PLATOON or APOCALYPSE NOW instead
470149	1532177	261066	4.0	Disappointing	Poets ? They're a bit gay aren't they ? Usually they're middle class and middle aged and they get ripped off by scam merchants who post adverts saying " Send us your poetry submissions for our best selling anthology book of erotic poetry and don't forget to enclose $30 for administration costs " In short there's nothing less cool than poetry but Miguel Pinero made the genre cool , streetwise and sexy and he deserved a far better biopic than this I'd never heard of the guy until I saw this movie . A remarkable life story of a man who spent time in the big house and soon achieved critical acclaim via his plays and poetry . He wrote a play called SHORT EYES set in a prison , a play that was turned into a film . Just out of curiosity I went to this site and looked it up . The phrase " short eyes " is American prison slang for a child molester the lowest of the low in any penal system . It's also a movie that IMDb reviewers have greatly praised . Now why did I have to visit this site to find out the remarkable story behind the making of the film ( Check out the trivia page on SHORT EYES - I guarantee you'll be amazed ) if I was watching a biopic on the play write behind it ? By trying to show us how cool and streetwise the eponymous character is the director / screenwriter fails to show us anything about Miguel Pinero the man apart from that he swore and took a lot of drugs which hardly made him a unique individual . The story slips in time and space , from colour to monochrome and has characters appearing and disappearing in a haphazard manner . Miguel Pinero made poetry the new street culture and he probably deserved a better film telling his life story
469085	1532177	94638	4.0	Another Crap TVM	Another TVM that's a waste of time . The plot revolves around a ballsy police captain - And yes she's a woman - trying to weed out poor practice and corruption in her department . Apart from the usual twee faults of a TVM production there were several things that irritated me about this film . 1 ) Suzanne Pleshettes's performance . If you have the misfortune of seeing ALONE IN THE NEON JUNGLE check out the way Pleshette is unable to keep her head still . It really is distracting the way she shakes or nods her head while speaking . 2 ) Despite being set in 1988 everyone wears clothes from different eras . We see people ( Pimps I take it ) walking about dressed like John Travolta in SNF , punks even though they died out a few years before , and bikers who look like they're straight out of a early 70s road movie3 ) The hookers in this all wear tights ( Pantyhose I think they're called in America ) but I'm led to believe most hookers have sex with their clients in the back of their car so are tights a practical item of clothing for a streetwalking working girl ? And it just shows what poor entertainment this film is when I find myself asking an abstract question like thatOh and ALONE IN THE NEON JUNGLE also features one of the most incomprehensible lines I've ever heard . When trying to break a corrupt cop the heroine says " Do you know what they do to cops in prison ? They rape you by throwing you from the top tier " Can someone send me a private message telling me what the hell getting raped by being thrown from the top tier is ? Oh and despite cops getting blown away in Pittsburgh prostitution and burglary seem to be the only crimes the police department worry about
469269	1532177	315398	4.0	The Rules Of Plagerism	To all you wannabe movie makers out there don't worry about plagerism because you can only be sued if you tear the top sheet containing the screenplay credits off and insert your new top sheet saying you're the author of the screenplay . That's the literal and legal meaning of plagerism , trust me I've been to film school and I know what I'm talking about and this knowledge must come as a relief to the producers of CHRISTMAS RUSH which is identical in plot to the original DIE HARD movie and when I say identical I do mean identical in every way even down to the bad guys , some of whom are German - I did say identical didn't I ? - taking the hero cop's wife hostage . Did I mention this film's identical to DIE HARD ?
468793	1532177	67445	4.0	Yawn . Yawn . Yawn	The opening of MORTE A VENEZIA resembles a Duran Duran music video with classical music and this is the highlight of the movie " In terms of what Theo ? " In terms of everything , but especially excitement . I doubt if there's ever been a more sluggish slower moving movie than this one . Yeah okay it's a European art house movie so I wasn't expecting Charles Bronson to massacre hordes of bad guys but even so I did expect some substance if not an actual plot The film revolves around Professor Gustav Von Aschenbach visiting Venice . Gustav visits Venice and goes on a gondola , Gustav eats in an expensive restaurant , Gustav looks out of his hotel window and if it's excitement you want Gustav has a flashback Bad enough if this was the entire movie but it gets worse because Gustav notices a pretty boy teenager . So you've got a middle aged academic lusting after some teenage boy he has seen , some old queen is becoming obsessed with a stranger . Great idea for a movie ? I don't think so either and thank gawd it remained a yawn fest instead of some sleazy precursor to gay porn I notice a lot of people who praise this movie have tried to intellectualise it . I can only be monosyllabic and unpretentious in my view and say that the only subtext I could relate to was the physical and emotional disintegration of Gustav but it wasn't caused by the effete beauty of the teenage boy - It was caused by watching such a boring and ostentatious movie
469243	1532177	113957	4.0	Mediocre	Computing . Can there be anything more boring ? Sitting in front of a computer all day typing away at some keys all day every day , tap tap tapping . That's much of the problem with this movie , the heroine sits in front of a computer VDU tapping the keys and no matter how many looks of agitation she gives , or how much suspenseful notes the composer strikes or how many extreme close ups the director uses there's not much excitement down to the fact that there's few things less exciting than watching somebody on a computer There's a few other problems too much of them factual errors regarding how computers work . Is it possible to hack into a computer that is both turned off and not connected to the internet ? I guess that when THE NET was made 10 years ago very few people would understand how computers worked so the screenwriters would have been able to BS at length but since we now live in a global village where nearly every household in the western world has their own computer the audience are certainly very clued up on the factual errors of this movie . And of course there's too many instances where someone acts stupid or out of character at crucial times in order to progress the plot which makes THE NET a very mediocre movie
470024	1532177	55746	4.0	Nothing To Do With Sea Food	The title sequence is phemomenally literal . We see an animated prawn wooing a mate and the sequence finishes with the mummy and daddy prawns herding their off spring away from camera . You can imagine the sequence designer being told the title of the movie by the producer and nothing else so you can't blame the guy for being so literally minded . Come on with a title like THE AMOROUS PRAWN what did you think this film was about ? As for the rest of the movie there's little I can recall apart from Ian Carmichael being cast against type as a working class corporal and since I only saw it a few hours ago that probably tells you something of its quality . It's one of those British " Blimey where'd I leave my trousers ? " type farces featuring a bunch of squaddies pulling a scam on American tourists , too gentle to be compared to the CARRY ON franchise and too slapstick to appeal to sophisticated audiences . It's this type of unambitious movie made by studios that quickly killed off the British film industry since this years British success story was DOCTOR NO , a film that was produced and financad by Americans and appealed to a world wide audience
469019	1532177	71118	4.0	Not As Good As The TV Show	This film version of James Herriot's series of novels isn't much cop compared to the television show of the same . This movie is the prior piece but there's nothing very memorable about . The plot is more or less composed of " Will young James get married to his girlfriend or not ? " , hardly the most original or compelling premise for a movie , and we're treated to little in the way of these blackly comical scenes of animals and their owners having mishaps that made the TV show enjoyable . Perhaps the worst problem is that Tristan ( Played by boyish mischief in the show by Peter Davison ) is more or less a peripheral character in this movieThe cast are passable ( Simon West was rather famous when this was produced while Anthony Hopkins was almost totally unknown ) but they seem to lack the flair that Christopher Timothy , Robert Hardy and Peter Davison brought to the long running series
468694	1532177	429487	4.0	What's Going On ?	I firmly believe that the best Oscar ceremony in recent years was in 2003 for two reasons : 1 ) Host Steve Martin was at his most wittiest : " I saw the teamsters help Michael Moore into the trunk of his limo " and " I'll better not mention the gay mafia in case I wake up with a poodle's head in my bed " 2 ) Surprise winners : No one had Adrien Brody down for best actor ( Genuine applause ) or Roman Polanski for best director ( Genuine jeers and boos ) but they won Last year's award ceremony wasn't too bad but there was little in the way of surprises and I was happy to see RETURN OF THE KING sweep the awards even if it wasn't the best in the trilogy ( FELLOWSHIP was much better ) but what let the BBC coverage down was Jonathan Ross getting a few of his sycophantic mates round and pretending they were hilarious when they were anything but . So when I heard Sky were doing the coverage for British TV I was expecting Barry Norman and Mark Kermode to be doing the links , but instead we ended up with Jamie Theakston and Sharon Osbourne ! Oh gawd if British TV are desperate for film critics ( Obviously they are ) I'm sure both Bob The Moo and Theo Robertson will happily fly over to LA to give their honest opinions on the winners and losers Chris Rock wasn't too bad , but he's no Steve Martin while the location seemed to resemble a sports hall with seats put in ! Not much of a glitzy arena in my opinion . The main problem I had with the ceremony was the format with the " minor " Oscars handed out to the winners who were sitting in their seats ! There's no such thing as a " minor " Oscar and just because the award is for Best Animated Short or Best Costume Design they're as well deserved as Best Picture or Best Director . All the winners should be allowed to march up to the podium . What a bunch of arrogant snobs the Academy are becoming and I quite agree with the comments that this format is disgraceful and if it wasn't for the surprises this could possibly have been the worst ceremony in history . As for the awards themselves Best Supporting Actress - Cate Blanchett . No great surprise for a competitive category Best Supporting Actor - Morgan Freeman . No real complaints since Freeman is one of America's greatest living character actors Best Actor - Jamie Foxx . Most predictable award of the night . Yawn Best Actress - Hilary Swank . Major surprise since everyone thought Annette Benning was going to win simply down to academy politics but Swank did deserve it and gave the best speech of the night Best Director - Clint Eastwood . Major surprise since everyone thought Scorsese was going to get the award simply because he'd never won one . Actually I'm glad about this because if he didn't deserve it for TAXI DRIVER , RAGING BULL or GOODFELLAS he didn't deserve it for THE AVIATOR Best Film - MILLION DOLLAR BABY . Again another major surprise since everyone thought the academy would split the awards for best director and best picture while I thought the Hollywood friendly plot of THE AVIATOR would have made it a dead cert for Best Picture while MDB's controversial subject matter would have turned a lot of voters off What these awards perhaps illustrate is that this year the voters have decided to ignore Oscar politics and genuinely give out awards to people who deserve it something they haven't done in the past , I mean A BEAUTIFUL MIND beating THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING for gawd's sake ! And long may the academy vote with their heads instead of their hearts
469298	1532177	138704	4.0	Love It Or Hate It Indie Art House Flick	Maths genius Max Cohen finds himself being pressured by a a corporate gang who want to make profits on the stock market and a bunch of kabbala Jews who want to contact god There that's the premise of PI . One that on the surface seems both entertaining and slightly bizarre , but I have to warn you that this is one of the most bizarre movies I've seen in a long time , try and imagine David Lynch on acid and you may just start to understand how strange this movie is . Did I use the word " Understand " in this review ? Believe me that word will be coming up frequently since I couldn't understand the plot at all , that's right this reviewer has the courage to admit that he doesn't understand maths , he doesn't understand kabbalistic dogma , or that doesn't understand what maths has got to do with the stock market since it's run by market forces not mathematical equations . I also didn't understand the scenes with Max stabbing a brain with a pencil or what he was doing sitting on a park bench at the end since he drove a power drill through his head in the penultimate scene . If any of the above sounds so crazy you want to watch it because of the craziness factor be warned because much of the running time is taken up with Max sitting in front of a computer doing equations . That's right a man sitting in front of a computer same as you're doing right now as I sit in a computer typing up this review . Can there be anything as tedious or as unexciting or as uncinematic as watching someone in front of a computer ? The only scene of PI that elicts any type of excitement is when Max is saved from the corporate bad guys by the kabbalistic bad guys but apart from that the rest of PI revolves mainly around Max tapping away at his keyboard doing maths Perhaps because of the dry subject matter director Darren Aronofsky does make the movie as bizarre as possible but it's nightmarish rather than involving , disturbing rather than entertaining , hateful rather than admirable with the cinematography , editing and musical score making this a very memorable piece of indie art house if for not all the wrong reasons then certainly not for all the right reasons - I've watched a great number of horror movies and very few of them have freaked me out as much as PI . Though if you look at the trivia section on this page you'll see that the production has a few interesting stories behind it so credit where it's due . But it still remains a movie that will be hated by a mainstream audience
469018	1532177	54357	4.0	Hardly A Disney Classic	Seeing as it's Easter the Tv companies in Britain have been showing several Disney films of which SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON is one . To be honest this far from being a Disney classic , yeah it's a family adventure ( Literally ) but doesn't have the impact of 20 , 000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA . This down mainly to two reasons 1 ) The episodic nature . There's the threat of pirates throughout the movie but they don't appear towards the end so we're treated to superflous scenes of the family building tree houses etc . What this movie needed more than anything is danger rather than wish fufillment 2 ) Francis the irritating kid with the whining American accent . Oh dear lord actors should never appear with animals or children and audiences shouldn't have to suffer them either . It's not often that I see a film where a child is in danger from a tiger and I found myself cheering for the tiger It's not the worst Disney movie I've ever seen , it does star John Mills who always give a good performance and it probably done pretty well at the box office at least compared to recent Disney mega-flops like THE LADYKILLERS and THE ALAMO
469087	1532177	97770	4.0	The Clichés Are Badly Executed - Snigger	A man who takes the law into his own hands after someone has committed an unforgivable crime against an innocent victim is a cliché and it's this cliché that Sly Stallone plays in LOCK UP . Does anyone know any different words for " cliché " ? because I'll be using that word an awful lot in this review . No ? Oh dear Sly plays a character called Frank Leone who finds himself being transferred by a maximum security hellhole ( cliché ) run by a sadistic warder ( cliché ) . Despite it being the worst place imaginable in the dialogue the system itself isn't so bad because inmates are allowed to service cars ( cliché and plot point ) and receive contraband and many of the inmates are really good guys ( cliché and plot point ) . In fact there's only a couple of really sadistic inmates ( cliché ) who have it in for Frank and considering Frank's composed of solid muscle you'd think they'd hit on much softer targets but I guess scary big men using weaker inmates as their sex slaves would have been rather clichéd and predictable . Still that hasn't stopped the producers using every other cliché in the book This is very predictable and fairly grim from an entertainment point of view . Stallone never was a great actor and fails to convince as Frank . Worse still not even the great Donald Sutherland seems able to do anything with his role and despite using real life inmates for crowd scenes they come across as just a bunch of extras from a central casting agency which shows you how bad a film LOCK UP really is
468572	1532177	118655	5.0	I Preferred The Sequel	I really enjoyed THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME . It was the first film in the series I saw which may possibly explain why I enjoyed the original a lot less . THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME cuts to the chase very quickly while AUSTIN POWERS : INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY is held by the very obvious and necessary need to explain who the eponymous hero is . Of course it's silly to criticise the other aspects like " Oh there's no Fat Bastard in this movie etc " because it's my own fault for watching the franchise in the wrong order I can't help thinking however that the jokes are somewhat weaker here . I watched the movie on Sunday night and I'm having some difficulty in trying to remember the gags . There's two that stick out in my mind , one is the scene with Dr Evil's cat which will upset cat lovers everywhere ( I laughed out loud at this scene ) and the other is a visual gag that stands out in its unoriginality of a man walking about naked thatI first saw done in THE BENNY HILL SHOW thirty years ago and has been done to death since then Not a bad effort from Mike Myers but my gut instinct is that THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME is the funniest movie in the series
469705	1532177	295178	5.0	Time To Say Goodbye Baby	Despite enjoying the sequel more than the original I thought GOLDMEMBER was the weakest in the Austin Powers trilogy possibly due to the air of entire self indulgence that runs throughout the movie . This is personified by the appearance of Michael Caine as Nigel Powers . You can just imagine Caine picking up the script and reading : " Nigel is surrounded by four sexy skimpliy dressed bimbos in knee length boots " and Caine thinking " Well I grew up in absolute poverty and fought in The Korean war so what have I to feel guilty about " In other words the cast are in serious danger of enjoying themselves far more than the audience and you do get the feeling the film is more for the people who worked on it rather than the worldwide audience Take the highly intrusive self referential pre title sequence cameo appearances . How does the film benefit from this ? It doesn't . Likewise there's some clumsy continuity from Jay Roach . For example Austin is in the villains base and chase's after the villain , the only thing is the base is crawling with the villain's henchmen and at no point do they interact with what's going on . I should also confess that having seen this movie several days ago only one funny sequence sticks in my mind . One where Austin grabs the wrong end of the stick involving Mini Me while there's several scenes that stick in my mind because they're painfully unfunny like the subtitles and the joke that was recycled from the previous movie . Watching GOLDMEMBER isn't quite a painful cinematic experience but certainly the producers could have come up with something far better . Hopefully this will be the last ( And it's certainly the least ) in the Austin Powers franchise
468551	1532177	348031	5.0	Very Familiar Horror / SF Story	One reason horror movies aren't well regarded amongst critics is down to the fact that in order for the plot to work the characters have to do stupid things like wander around a dark woodland knowing fine well that people have disappeared in that location . In other words logic flies out the window . One other reason for the low regard of this genre is that plots have been done to death and the horror film has lost its lustre down to really rank repetition . SILENT WARNINGS is a case in point As soon as the characters are introduced I let out a very audible sigh . We're introduced to the staple diet of American horror movies - horny teenagers . This a diet that's been dished out to audiences for over 30 years and anyone who once had an appetite for this type of movie must now surely be suffering from a cinematic eating disorder . However at least the story does have some originality in that it doesn't rip off HALLOWEEN . Instead it rips off a couple of other horror / sci-fi classics . Can you guess what they are ? I'll give you a clue . One of them also featured crop circles in a cornfield and starred Mel Gibson while the other is a 1967 Hammer horror movie based on a 1957 BBC play by Nigel Kneale . Even the the title of conjures up images of the Gibson movie and I guess that's why this movie isn't called WARNING SIGNS I will be somewhat merciful in this review and take into account that this is a very cheap direct to DVD film shot in Bulgaria . At least the director has picked a location that resembles the American Mid West . Strange to think that both Stephen Baldwin and Billy Zane were once relatively well known prolific actors but I can't recall the last time either appeared in a fairly successful movie and I doubt if SILENT WARNINGS made any casting directors sit up and take notice . The rest of the cast are alright in rather clichéd roles and if you're in to horror or SF movies then you may find this movie a harmless enough time waster
470038	1532177	43461	5.0	Rather Mythical And Disappointing Biography	Even today the name Erwin Rommel conjures up visions of a superlative soldier and a complex man . In short Field Marshal Erwin Rommel was an enigma , a member of the Nazi party and an admirer of Hitler but who fought the cleanest campaign of the war in North Africa . Compare the conduct of both sides in that particular conflict then compare it to say the Eastern front or the Pacific campaign . As BAND OF BROTHERS shows it wasn't uncommon for either side to execute prisoners even if practical necessity wasn't involved So Rommel was respected as both a soldier and a human being but THE DESERT FOX is a disappointment . It's a Hollywood movie that was made just six years after the end of the war so in some places the producers don't want to praise the subject matter too much which is understandable because an American audience wouldn't like a movie where the lead character has contemptible views of American servicemen after soundly beating them at The Kasserine Pass . But at other points in the movie Rommel is seen praising Hitler while describing other senior party members as " Murderers " ! There thankfully seems to be historical context to all this . Yes Erwin Rommel was an admirer of Hitler because Hitler solved many economic problems like hyper inflation and massive unemployment when he came to power in 1933 so for a German to admire Hitler in those days was the norm however objectionable this may seem with hindsight . Unfortunately once the war ended instantly revisionist opinions amongst the surviving Germans came to the fore where they bleated that they despised Hitler and the Nazis and their genocidal policies and we see this in umpteen movies like DAS BOOT , CROSS OF IRON and THE EAGLE HAS LANDED , so much so that you'd think that there was only a handful of Nazis in Germany from 1933-45 , so at least this movie deserves some credit for putting things into perspective However once again bad history and factual errors creep in as Rommel is recruited into the plot to assassinate Hitler . Rommel may have been asked to take part in the plot to overthrow Hitler but this movie over states the case . Worse it also paints Gerd Von Rundstedt ( Possibly the Wehrmacht's greatest leader ) as knowing about the assassination plot against Hitler but casually refusing to take part . Despite being no fan of Hitler or his murderous stooges Von Rundstedt was as shocked and as disgusted as the most loyal party member upon hearing of the bombing of Hitler's headquarters so it's highly unlikely he'd have had prior knowledge of the assassination plot . The ending is somewhat moving as Rommel is arrested and led away on charges of treason but perhaps the most poignant thing is that in real life Rommel was as innocent as nearly every other person murdered by the Nazis since he took no part in the plot . The story goes that immediately after the plot Rommel's staff started criticising the fact that it would have been better if the plot had suceeded hence Rommel was falsely suspected being one of the ringleaders which sealed his fate THE DESERT FOX : THE STORY OF ROMMEL is a very disappointing movie on one of the 20th Centuries most respected military leaders . It fails to show his life prior to 1941 when he ironically fought against the Italians in the first world war , of how he made his reputation as a military commander against the French in 1940 and how during the Normandy landings he and Von Rundstedt argued as to how best to use the panzer defences ( As Anzio showed naval firepower would wreak havoc on units close to the shoreline so Von Rundstedt was probably right ) but the movie shoots itself in the foot even more by including stuff that isn't correct and a film that I once enjoyed seeing as a child is now spoiled for me
470043	1532177	104692	5.0	Extremely Dated FX	This film isn't up to much . The central plot involves a village idiot who is used in a medical experiment which increases his intelligence and gives him psychic powers which he uses for revenge . The most annoying thing about THE LAWNMOWER MAN is the really crap FX which probably weren't all that good in 1992 but are truly awful 10 years later . A lot of people criticised the unconvincing burning man CGI in EVENT HORIZON but there's a scene of a man burning to death here which is totally unbelievable containing some of the worst computer animation I have ever seen . Likewise the scenes of people disintegrating into bubbles . Bad movie . Bad FX .
469487	1532177	60862	5.0	Generic Action Movie Done As A Western . Perhaps	I don't know if you can describe the plot of THE PROFESSIONALS as versatile but it can certainly be described as generic . Someone's wife is kidnapped by bad guys so the husband pays four tough gringos to get her back . This plot could easily have been set in the 21st century with the heroes traveling to the Central American rain forest or even the deserts of Iraq to hunt down the kidnappers and save the damsal in distress . The movie even touches upon politics with Marvin and Lancaster's characters discussing good guys and bad guys : " Only thing is does anyone know who the good guys are ? " , but since it's a western format everything soon settles down to being a straight forward action adventure with the gringos taking on both bandits and idealistic revolutionaries . Fans of both westerns and action movies will certainly enjoy it . I was entertained myself but I kept getting the feeling the movie wanted to make political statements somewhere down the line and bottled out at the last minute which does give the movie a slightly confused feel , but maybe I'm reading too much into it
468461	1532177	113552	5.0	Good Cast In Very Average Film	Nicolas Cage , Helen Hunt and Samuel L Jackson in a film from the 1990s ! Must be good I thought . Well actually KISS OF DEATH is not all that good , it's by no means bad it's just that the three afore mentioned stars were well known at the time but weren't stars yet . The film was made around the same time as David Caruso was trying to break into films and is really a star vehicle for him . Helen Hunt is fairly effective for the short screentime she gets , Samuel L Jackson is just okay but Nicolas Cage is far too over the top to be taken seriously and will never make a convincing screen villain which is why you'll never see him play a baddy these days . As for Caruso . . . well can anyone name anything he's been in apart from NYPD BLUES or JADE ? Bottom line is KISS OF DEATH is a mediocre remake let down mainly by its star and a very weak script
469894	1532177	83232	5.0	Too Slow For Some Tastes . . . .	. . . . Including mine I stayed up late to watch TRUE CONFESSIONS down to the simple reason it contained performances by De Niro and Duvall . Neither performance disappointed ( Remember this was made in 1981 when DeNiro was a God when it came to acting . How times change ) but the rest of the film did . I was under the impression that this was going to be very similar to LA CONFIDENTIAL and for brief spots the movie hints it's heading in that direction with its subplot of the murder of a prostitute and pornography but there's far too many slow talky scenes with static direction and there seems to be a subtext of catholic guilt in there somewhere which will probably confuse anyone who didn't attend a catholic school as a child . If you want to see DeNiro in a great film about redemption and guilt watch ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA instead
468748	1532177	274166	5.0	Not The Worst Brit Comedy You Will See	The critics were unkind to this and I got the impression it was down to two reasons : 1 ) The character Johnny English is based on a character that appeared on credit card adverts in the early 1990s . you get the gut instinct that character development isn't something that applies to characters appearing in adverts 2 ) Bond spoofs are old hat and weren't all that funny in the first place So I was sat there at Christmas thinking I'd be watching something with all the appeal of 37 day old turkey sandwiches but I was fairly impressed . Okay I wasn't rolling around the floor with tears streaming down my face but I've always liked Rowan Atkinson's arrogant portrayal of Edmund Blackadder and the character of Johhny English is just as similar to Blackadder as it is to Mr Bean . I will grant you the jokes are hit and miss or predictable like the scene where English infiltrates the villains HQ and finds an old man : " What did they do to you ? " " They took some of my blood " " The b @ stards " Of course you can see the pay off long before it appears but that still doesn't stop it from being amusing when it doesNo doubt a lot of pretentious John Malkovich fans were left stratching their heads wondering why he was slumming it in JOHNNY English but if you've enjoyed anything Rowan Atkinson has been in you'll certainly find this comedy very watchable
469939	1532177	48662	5.0	Deja Vu	One Sunday afternoon in 1982 BBC 1 broadcast STORM OVER THE NILE . Nothing remarkable in itself with this scheduling but later that evening the ITV channel broadcast THE FOUR FEATHERS remake from the late 1970s ! Two different versions of the same story broadcast a few hours within each other on the two network channels ! Amazing , and not something that was unnoticed since myself and several school colleagues remarked upon this the next day . We were all in unanimous agreement that STORM OVER THE NILE was the much superior movie . Strangely over the years every time Terence Young's version is broadcast the TV guides don't have kind words for the 1955 film version of AEW Mason's story and after seeing the original 1939 version of THE FOUR FEATHERS I understand why - It's a rip off ! In the past I have criticised movies like CRITICAL MASS and RANGERS that use extensive film footage from other movies like TERMINATOR 2 and NAVY SEALS . With STORM we see the exact same thing . The truly great battle scenes weren't directed by Young they were directed by Zoltan Korda almost 20 years earlier . To be fair I don't think the producers are claiming that this is an entirely original movie hence the credit for both Korda and Young in the directors slot but I did see the 1939 version a week earlier on channel 4 and this spoils the enjoyment of STORM since the script is identical as are most of the action scenes . If you've never seen the original you'll like this movie but if you remember the unforgettable 1939 version by the Korda brothers you'll be left with a cynical feeling watching this
469582	1532177	60355	5.0	Not As Good As I Heard	After reading some of the comments on this page I was expecting more . I sat down to watch DUEL AT DIABLO thinking I'd be watching something similar to ULZANA'S RAID or SOLDIER BLUE , but they're both Vietnam allegories or rather anti Vietnam war allegories from the early 1970s while this movie was made in 1966 when the war was still popular amongst Americans . To be honest I couldn't find any ' Nam subtext and I doubt very much if there was any to start with . Yeah there might be some sympathy shown to the injuns via a throw away line about living on the reservations being lied to , but once you see the tortured bodies of the white eyes you stop feeling sorry for them in any way There is a slight problem with the acting though . Bibi Anderson isn't a native English speaker which means when she delivers her lines like " I - was - better - off - with - the - injuns " they sound very strange coming from her mouth . Sidney Poiter is a good actor but seems strangely cast as Toller and does anyone else think the producers cast Dennis Weaver thinking he was Dennis Hopper ? It's not a bad film and I guess it was violent and sadistic when it was first released but as has been mentioned it hasn't dated well
468586	1532177	114069	5.0	Boring And Disappointing	Get the producer of PLATOON and the director of DAS BOOT to cast Hoffman , Freeman , Sutherland , Gooding Jnr and Spacey in a thriller about a killer virus and you'll have a sure fire blockbuster hit . And OUTBREAK was a major hit at the box office but does this make it a good film ? In my opinion - no . Despite having an all star cast and massive budget and despite the very good pre titles sequence OUTBREAK is a bad movie . The main culprit for this debacle is Dworet and Pool's script , it's far too talky . Too much time is dedicated to talking about the virus and not enough time is shown just how awful the virus is . It's made worse by the fact that when people do talk ( And boy they never stop talking ) only banal words come out of their mouths : " Oh my gawd " is very popular as is " Gawd dammit " and not forgetting " Gawd help us all " as they realise time is running out . Undoubtedly the most disappointing aspect to the script is when the town is put into quarantine , there's no real attempt on the part of the screenwriters to bring moral ambiguity or blur the edges of right and wrong with this scenario . With a few rare exceptions the citizens comply with directives . Despite being an extremely unpleasant film THE CRAZIES made far better use of this speculative plot and its moral consequences unlike here where Donald Sutherland is the bad guy because he wants to firebomb a town to stop the virus spreading . If you were in his shoes what would you do ? Would you be a bad person for firebombing the town in order to save the world from the virus ? Ah but there's a plot device that does show Sutherland's character to be the villain of the piece so out goes any intelligent subtext as to what would be the right or wrong thing to do in such a situation . So just to sum up : despite its great cast and production team OUTBREAK is nothing special and at times feels like an overblown TVM
469299	1532177	144084	5.0	Another Movie Trying To Be Too Clever	I'd heard a lot about the original novel though I'd never read it , possibly because it sounded like product placement with the anti hero giving long winded descriptions of what beauty products he uses and what designer suits he wears . This is translated into the start of the movie as Patrick Bateman washes , shaves , ex foliates and dresses in brand names . There's two problems with this , firstly that it holds up the main plot of a violent serial killer bumping people off and secondly it doesn't connect with people like me who didn't spend a massive fortune on expensive brand products in the 1980s Did you know this story was set in 1980s New York ? Oh yes you notice things like mobile phones the size of the brick , smoking in bars , and really crap music by Phil Collins and Huey Lewis And The News , but for much of the running time you totally forget what decade the story is set . Did anyone notice giant shoulder pads or hair like exotic plants ? , y'know fashion statements from the 80s some people don't like to talk about today . All these things seem to be missing as if director Mary Harron has only included 80s icons when the screenplay specifically referred to them . Watch WALL STREET just before you watch this and you'll instantly notice that one movie was obviously filmed during the 1980s while the other one obviously wasn't But the major problem with AP is that it tries far too hard to be clever . Despite the slow start once Patrick Bateman ( Played by Christian Bale doing a mean Jim Carrey impersonation ) starts bumping off people he doesn't like my attention was held except for a couple of details . When Bateman drags the body of Paul Allen through a busy concourse he leaves a trail of blood which nobody notices . That's detail number one while detail number two is when he chases the prostitute through his apartment block without again nobody noticing he kills her in an unlikely sequence by throwing the chainsaw over a flight of stairs . This got me thinking as to how no one notices his slaughter of innocents . I mean it's obvious the cops are onto him and yet no one notices the mounting death toll . Could it be that he's imagining it all ? By letting the cat out of the bag too soon with these two sequences from Mary Herron I was able to work out by the time he blows up a couple of NYPD patrol cars that Bateman's frustration in life is causing him to be deluded well before the final scenes . Did I say this movie was trying to be too clever ? Maybe I should say too confusing because it insinuates that Patrick Bateman is Paul Allen , or is a figment of Paul Allen's imagination . Duh . Whatever . Considering the very overrated FIGHT CLUB which came out round about the same time has a similar plot twist at the end AP's positives are dimmed even further by comparison
468881	1532177	340376	5.0	Cor Blimey Guv , It's French Nazis	France in the early 1940s was hell on earth . Nazis would round up Jews and execute them in cold blood . We know this because this is how THE STATEMENT begins . What we didn't know was that London geezers participated in the cruel murders . It's so obvious you can't ignore it because the victims are told to stand against the wall as in " Cor blimey guv . If it ain't a bunch of Jewish geezers we're going to murder . And after I've murdered them I'll be popping up the apple and pears to see me old china Mary Poppins for a rendition of me old bamboo and knees up mother brown " For goodness sake if you're going to portray French people then please get someone to at least try and make a go of a French or vaguely European accent . Words fail to describe how bad the opening sequence is having Michael Caine dub over a French character . At best it's unintentionally funny , at worst it's offensive . Seeing characters being murdered due to their perceived race is no laughing matter As for the rest of the film it's beautifully shot but boring and once again I have to point out that not one single character sounds like they're French . Not only that you're never even convinced that Tilda Swinton's character is female , her dialogue seems as if it's written for a man . It's also without doubt the worst film Michael Caine has starred in for several years and his bizarre out of place performance reflects this
469471	1532177	256380	6.0	I Was Expecting something Else	Did the Farrelly brothers really make this ? They were the guys who made DUMB AND DUMBER , KINGPIN , ME MYSELF AND IRENE and who made the fantastic THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY , so I was expecting another movie involving cruelty to animals and other offensive topics , but I was rather disappointed . Don't get me wrong this is a very watchable romantic comedy and is more amusing than most comedies coming out of Hollywood but at the end of the day it's just another rom com albeit one with a very interesting premise . It's just that the manic cruelty of the Farrelly brothers is totally missing . I suppose they could defend themselves by saying SHALLOW HAL is their most disciplined , intelligent movie and they'd be right . It's far from being their best movie however
469157	1532177	390521	6.0	Interesting But Misses Out On A Very Valid Point	Last year seemed to be a battle between FARENHEIT and SUPER SIZE ME for winner of the most controversial documentary award . I know Moore's style , I know Moore's agenda but knew nothing of Morgan Spurlock . Right from the opening scenes of Spurlock's documentary I was impressed by his style , he does engage the audience without resorting to polemical opinion disguised as fact and for that we should be thankful . Spurlock decides to find out why Americans are becoming obese by living on nothing but a menu from a certain fast food chainSo far so good , but is he missing a point I wonder ? American fast food chains are notorious for serving processed food with an incredible high fat high sugar content which probably won't do you any good health wise . But they also serve food in very large portions which is also very good value for money . Think about it for a moment - You go into a fast food chain with a couple of dollars and have a meal high in fat and sugar but the meal itself is relatively cheap . Would you rather spend 50 dollars getting a single meal in an expensive restaurant and leave the table still wanting ? I think most people visit a fast food chain to kill the hunger pangs and still have enough money to pay the bills . Watching Spurlock vomit because he's eaten too much is a kind of back handed compliment to a certain food chain for selling extra large portions Unlike Moore Spurlock doesn't appear to have an axe to grind and does try to be objective . He makes the point that the high rise in obesity may be down to the fact that many American states don't have a compulsory sports syllabus in schools . Certainly this doesn't help to keep children in good health but he then points out another fact that one of the few states that does have compulsory school sports - Illinois - has the third highest rate for childhood obesity in America . Cause and effect ? The problem I do have with SUPER SIZE ME is that Spurlock doesn't exactly hammer home one very valid point - Perhaps the only valid point - as to childhood obesity and that's parenting . When you were a child what was your parents attitude to what you eat ? I know what mines was : If you didn't like what was put down in front of you then too bad and I think perhaps in the Western world this attitude has disappeared , parents are far more likely to give into their children's demands nowadays in search for an easier life . If they like chomping on burgers then so be it if it keeps the little ones quiet . Remember what I said about big portions and cost ? It doesn't really matter if the food itself is far from nutritious as long as it's plentiful and affordable which means for a lot of parents on low incomes it's a practical choice . Over here in Britain the government are actually discussing putting a tax on junk food . Would hitting parents in the pocket change their attitude ? Is it morally right for a government to do this anyway ? Why is healthy organic food infinitely more expensive than unhealthy processed muck ? Just a couple of points that aren't addressed So SUPER SIZE ME is an interesting documentary but a rather flawed one that often works better as entertainment than as a serious film making . It can be informative but doesn't really come up with any answers and blames fast food companies rather than parents for childhood obesity .
469185	1532177	65462	6.0	Slightly Strange Sequel	! ! ! ! ! POSSIBLE SPOILER ! ! ! ! ! There's two possible reasons you can criticise BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES for . First of all by playing it safe and have Brent go through the same sort of plot that happened to Taylor in the first movie then ( Second possible criticism ) have the film mutate ( Geddit ? ) into something rather different from the first half of the story . I don't know if it's just me but the second half of this film has an entirely different feel from the rest of the franchise . It's by no means abad thing because I really did enjoy this bleak downbeat twist of amutant kamikaze karioke singalong , though no doubt a lot of reviewersseem to hate it . I actually saw this at the cinema a few months before PLANET OF THE APES premiered on British television which meant I my enjoyment of the shock ending of the original was spoiled slightly . Let that be a warning to you - Never watch a film franchise out of order . And never EVER let mutant humans write hymns !
469651	1532177	221838	6.0	True ?	I was sitting in front of the TV flicking through the film channels trying to find a film I haven't seen before : " Seen that . Watched that , that's total crap " and grew more and more frustrated at trying to find a film I'd never seen before . The only reason I started watching BORSTAL BOY was it was the only movie on TV that night that I hadn't seen and wasn't too impressed when the TV guide described it as " An affecting coming of age drama about IRA saboteur Brendan Behan " so I was expecting another film about the peace loving pacifists of the IRA no doubt financed with money from the ailing British ( And spot the irony of that ) film industry , but I was pleasantly surprised by BORSTAL BOY . It's quite a charming little film , very well written and acted by a largely unknown castMy only real problems with the film is that it perhaps tries a little too hard to be likeable . With the exception of Del none of the young crims come across as being violent criminals . Also I'm just not sure how " true " this true story is because I had the instinctive feeling that a few of the facts had been changed in order to give BORSTAL BOY a more dramatic impact , some of the friendships seemed unlikely and being assigned to HMS Prince Of Wales ! How unlucky is that ? But if you take the facts with a pinch of salt you'll certainly like this film , especially if you found SCUM to be such a turn off due to its unrelenting violence . And keep an eye out for the names Lee Ingleby and Danny Dyer . You might be hearing a lot more of them in the future
468671	1532177	78351	6.0	Has Its Moments	In my review of the television series I mentioned that THE SWEENEY has its episodes split between " comedy " episodes and " violent " episodes and after seeing the two film versions of the show this theory certainly holds up . The first SWEENEY film was a gritty political thriller with a high body count while the second film features a lot of humerous moments like the big John appeal box , " Remember - rubber is recyclable " , " When I said you couldn't organise a pss up at a brewary George I was wrong " and there's a running gag involving driver Robert Soames . That's not to say that this film should be classed as a black comedy , just that it contains darkly comic moments like the original series did . As has been noted the plot which involves a quasi fascist bunch of bank robbers could have easily have been made as a one hour episode ( And the film seems to have the budget of a one hour television episode ) but at least - Unlike the film versions of LOST IN SPACE and MISSION IMPOSSIBLE - this film resembles the television show it's based upon
468816	1532177	64072	6.0	Over Produced	The problem with this film is that it has so many big name stars that the story fails to do justice to the characters involved . Having said that the film does have its moments and does try to present the Luftwaffe crews as being no different from their opponents in the RAF . But after seeing CROSS OF IRON the previous week any film about the second world war is disappointing after that . Historical fact about the 1940 air war over Britain : Even if the Luftwaffe managed to destroy all RAF airfields they still wouldn't have the means to invade . The Nazis only had barges to cross the channel while the Royal Navy's fleet remained intact
469929	1532177	20698	6.0	Funny Despite The Weak Material	Oliver and Stan steal a bottle of booze from Stan's wife and depart to a speak easy . There that's the plot . No seriously that's the entire plot and it should have been awful but I spent most of the film with an amused grin on my face because it's a show case for the infectious mirth making slapstick of the greatest comedy duo who ever lived or will ever live . There's no reason why anyone should laugh at Stan passing a bottle to Oliver , or Stan putting an ice bucket on his head but I laughed out loud . Imagine if Jim Carrey and Chris Rock made a film where they bought some crack and decided to smoke it at an illegal drugs den ? It's with a premise like that you really do appreciate the talents of Laurel and Hardy
469365	1532177	192145	6.0	I Was Expecting Slightly More	This short film revolves around a couple of characters who are bored and want something to do . How about a game of chess ? Unfortunately one of the characters has eaten the pieces so that's that idea extinguished . How about a game of shadow puppets ? Oh a great idea as we get some abstract shapes against a wall . What on earth is that supposed to be ? MOOOOOOOOOOOOO Oh it must be a cow It's at this point that I should explain that the two characters featured are themselves shadow puppets ! I guess this is why some reviewers claim HUMDRUM is somewhat knowing , that it is almost post modernist and maybe it is and in no way is that a criticism but I was slightly disappointed by this effort from the Aardmann studios probably because the story itself is very slight and can be accurately described in my first paragraph . It is very inoffensive but at the same time very threadbare at only seven minutes
469045	1532177	75147	6.0	Good But Not Great	Check this out for a cast : Sean Connery - Scotland's greatest ever movie star Audrey Hepburn - An iconic actress Nicol Williamson - Many critics choice as Scotland's greatest ever actorRobert Shaw - Perhaps one of cinema's most overlooked actors when it comes to playing convincing bad guys Richard Harris - Another screen legend Ian Holm - In an early screen role . Can anyone think of a more convincing and consistent English actor alive in 2004 ? A great cast indeed but one that is not used to its full potential . Both Harris and Holm are very underused and their appearances at little more than cameos , and having a couple of heavyweight Scots playing the heroes does bring consistency to the characters ( Remember they've been together for years so why shouldn't speak with similar accents ? ) but their performances tend to cancel each other out There is another slight problem and that's the script . It seems to go against the legend of who Robin Hood was . People like to imagine that he was a good guy communist robbing the rich and giving the proceeds to the poor not someone who was a right hand man of Richard the Lionheart . I much preferred the mythical figure of the 1980s TV series that mixed myth and mystical plots . I also got slightly bored when the story started concentrating on the romance between Robin and Marion There was also a slight problem with the directing from Richard Lester where he tries to inject humour into the proceedings and it often fails . If I remember correctly this is something that spoiled his collabarition with Connery in CUBA , another movie that mixes action and romance with slight off beat humour Having pointed out these criticisms there's nothing much else wrong with ROBIN AND MARION , it's just that when you've got a bunch of butch men in a forest who dabble in swordplay in 2004 you're instantly reminded in some small way of a certain film trilogy that was released at the turn of the century which does spoil the positive aspects of this movie when watching it today . Having said that it's one of Connerey's better movies and Robert Shaw is very good as the villain with the battle between the two protagonists being every bit as violent and memorable as that seen in FROM Russia WITH LOV
469280	1532177	48971	6.0	Informative To A Degree	AWAY ALL BOATS differs from a lot of war movies at the time . It's shot in colour ( Don't forget that many prestigious war movies from the mid 1950s were still being done in monochrome ) and doesn't suffer from the seriously deadpan pseudo intellectualism of many other war films of that period The setting for the story is on the USS Belinda , a navy transport ( Assualt ? ) ship in the Pacific campaign . It should be pointed out that AWAY ALL BOATS is also a film that doesn't concentrate on action , so don't go into this film expecting massive explosions all the way through because it's a much more thoughtful film than that . We see why discipline is needed , why it's a bad idea to wax a floor on a ship and why aircraft identification is very important , it was very rare in those days for Hollywood to show a friendly fire scene and after seeing this movie you'll feel as though you've just served alongside Captain Hawks A war film that's possibly more informative than it is exciting but one that has merit
470018	1532177	117090	6.0	Bad Enough To Remain Very Watchable	I didn't think THE HAUNTED HEART ( As this movie is known in the UK ) was going to be up to much and it wasn't but this didn't stop me from enjoying it immensely . As ElviraVixen pointed out it's awful but will hold your interest for most of its running time . The plot itself revolves around Olivia Hendrix a rather sad and lonely middle aged woman who has only one son Tom and only one friend Mrs Jay and because of her sad loneliness she smothers young Tom too much while she listens to Mrs Jay too much . When Tom decides to leave the nest things start to head for a collision course The production values are somewhat poor and if it wasn't for some strong language you'd think this was yet another TVM but what makes it so watchable is the performances and Michael Angella's disturbingly seedy script . Granted it's rather awful but I did enjoy Mrs Jay ( Superbly played by Olympia Dukakis ) attempted seduction of Tom and the quite laughable dialogue : " Fuchsia ? But I hate fuchsia " and " Do you think you can remember that you stupid bitch ? " It might be a good idea to wear a diaper while watching this since you might just wet yourself laughing . The climax is gloriously contrived and incomprehensible but sums up the movie perfectly and my only real criticism is that we never hear Pink Floyd's track Mother which almost certainly inspired this terrible but highly entertaining movie
470217	1532177	90756	6.0	Why Is David Lynch So Popular ? . . . .	. . . . Because he's easy to analyze . Look at the opening sequence to BLUE VELVET - A montage of shots of suburban America followed by a slow pan into the grass where insects crawl from the ground . Don't you get it ? Like the ground there's something ugly trying to break through the calm reassuring surface of suburban America . Gosh what a genius Lynch must be allowing the audience into the concept of subtext like that . But can anyone tell me why he continually casts Kyle McClachlan in his movies ? He's got a pretty face but not much screen presence . But BLUE VELVET isn't a bad film ( Though it's not as good as its high IMDB rating says it is ) , Lynch doesn't go overboard with his often pretentious style of directing and it's a film that would deserve the oft used tag of " Hitchcock style thriller " for the most part , though Dennis Hopper's show stopping performance as the villain is something better suited to a Scorsese picture . But it's Hopper who made BLUE VELVET so memorable for me
470381	1532177	1205436	6.0	Good Enough Character Driven Story But With Several Serious Flaws	It's painfully obvious that Russell T Davies produced Who doesn't start reaching its stride until late in the season and he continues the trend here . It's also obvious that he's more than capable of writing a good opening hook and a good ending but what comes inbetween is extremely variable . Turn Left continues the trend also Perhaps the biggest difference between old style Who and its successor is how the classic series was driven by plot while NuWho is character driven . Both styles have their fans and detractors but unfortunately RTD often exploits character while diminishing plotting . The premise of Turn Left revolves around the Doctor never having met Donna Noble in The Runaway Bride and of him dying during that story ad the fall-out that goes with it both literally and metaphorically . It's a very good idea and RTD is great at ideas but unfortunately his plotting is flawed Think about itfor a minute . If the Doctor had died in The Runaway Bride then we'd have seen the witches succeed in The Shakespeare Code and the Daleks complete their plans in the season three Dalek story not to mention the Master taking over planet Earth . In other words Donna's world if not universe would be entirely different from the scenario seen here . RTD is using selective continuity to suit himself . This borders on cheating Talking of continuity leads to other irritants . I don't like obsessive continuity because it's what led to the show being postponed in the mid 1980s when we'd see old foes returning , anorakish references being made left right and centre which panders to the lowest common denominator of the fanbase whilst alienating more mainstream viewers . I do rate Billie Piper as being a talented actress but doubt if she's doing herself any favours by returning to the show . Can anyone seriously think of her as not being Rose Tyler any longer ? On the subject of continuity what is the point of bringing back UNIT if it's nothing like the organisation introduced in the 1968 story The Invasion ? UNIT doesn't even stand for United Nations Intelligence Taskforce - it's now become Unified Intelligence Taskforce and is composed of fat blokes and other minority groups . I bet Douglas Camfield is turning in his grave In short Turn Left is a fair enough story that shows the flexibility of DOCTOR WHO but after seeing it you are left with the impression that the show is running dangerously low on empty from RTD and that the season finale had better be something special
469952	1532177	101453	6.0	Came Out At The Wrong Time	BILLY BATHGATE isn't a bad film , and takes the trouble to show us the young and impressionable title character attraction towards the criminal underworld , a world where money and molls come easily to hand . It's also slightly old fashioned and you can imagine Edward G Robinson or James Cagney playing the part of Dutch Schultz and that's where the problem lies - Dustin Hoffman , who is a fine actor but I found him too laid back and since THE GODFATHER we don't expect mafia dons to be laid back , we expect them to be played By Pacino and DeNiro and see them throw things around and shout " My family " a lot . But worse still BILLY BATHGATE was released after a certain cinema masterpiece that featured Joe Pesci as a psycho hitman who never uses sentences unless the F word appears in every second word which means every gangster pic from the same era pales in comparison . So if you're going to watch BILLY BATHGATE judge it on its own merits because the performances are good enough as is the story , it's just that I kept hearing a voice in my head saying " I'm a funny guy ? Just what is so fing funny ? " while I was watching
470109	1532177	56234	6.0	Thanks Yank	Post Battle Of Britain there were two campaigns of the second world war that were almost exclusively British led and British fought . One was the North African campaign and the other was the Burma campaign , and unlike the inaccurate American flag waver OBJECTIVE BURMA the production team of MERRIL'S MARAUDERS have taken the time and effort to point out the British contribution of the campaign . A British patrol is spotted " A five hundred mile hike and the eighteeneth Japanese imperial army are waiting for them , I'm glad I ain't in that British Army - Amen to that " and later General Stilwell points out " That the British have been fighting alone here for three years " , so a big thank you to Sam Fuller and co for pointing out a few truths that American didn't win the war single handed . If only Spielberg , Hanks and Ambrose had done the same with BAND OF BROTHERS
469380	1532177	97579	6.0	Clichéd , Contrived , But Watchable Enough	Making a film set in an American prison is sort of like making a horror film . When making the latter all you have to do is keep the lighting low , hold the camera close up on a characters face , have scary sounds out of view and there you have something that will effectively scare an audience . With the former all you have to do is put an ordinary joe in a prison , surround him with a bunch of black men and have a guard say " Time for a shower you scum " and you'll have the audience biting their finger nails . SPOILERS Tom Selleck plays the everyman character of Jimmie Rainwood fairly well in this film and you really can empathise with him as he gets mugged by the home boys on his way back from the canteen , and the following scene made me aware of something I hadn't known at the time - American prisons are factionalised along ethnic lines . I know this now after reading up on it and watching documentaries on the American penal system which did slightly spoil the credibility of THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION for me . In no way should THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and AN INNOCENT MAN be compared of course , but this film is very entertaining and sometimes chilling as the prison clichés come one after the other . The white prisoners despise Jimmie for supposedly showing the white race to be weak while the black prisoners show what's in store for him by letting Jimmie witness a gang rape in the gym , and if you look like Tom Selleck you've got to worry about being popular in prison for all the wrong reasons . My main criticism about AN INNOCENT MAN is the rather weak ending where it's revealed that the cops who fitted up Jimmie are corrupt which lets the screen writers - just like Jimmie - get out of jail . All in all a good prison drama . If you like the HBO prison drama OZ you'll certainly enjoy this . The day after it was shown on the ITV network a TV presenter even referred to it on a news feature dealing with juvenile crime
470186	1532177	266555	6.0	A Few Flaws In The Plot But Not A Dead Loss	! ! ! ! ! SPOILERS ! ! ! ! ! A woman is raped by three men then five years later one of the rapists runs into the victim and wants to use her as a sex slave I had a problem with this premise right away - What's the chances of a rapist running into his victim like that ? And why use a former victim as a sex slave ? The plot holes continue with a scene where the victim dispatches one of the trio by hitting him over the head with a plastic bottle filled with water . She could have easily have used a kitchen knife but I suppose that would have been less dramatic . I guess all these vigilante / revenge dramas suffer from the plotholes seen in FREEZER ( As it's called on the sci-fi channel ) where the hero stands at a street corner and by an amazing power of coincidence just happens to chance along a scumbag who murdered his wife or raped his daughter see also THE EXTERMINATOR or DEATH WISHFREEZER does have some artistic worth in it's favour , and despite some violence it is a fairly understated film unlike I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE so the two shouldn't be compared . It's just that FREEZER is spoiled slightly by some unlikely occurances while the plot isn't anything more than " Rape victim increases collective morality of mankind by exterminating some scumbags " type story
469463	1532177	95631	7.0	One Of The Better Buddy Movies	Bounty hunter Jack Walsh apprehends bail jumper Jonathan Mardukas and attempts to take him to the other side of America unaware a rival bounty hunter , the mob and the feds are on their tales The above premise is all there is to the plot as Jack and Johnathan escape their rivals and that's to the movies benefit , no one tries too hard to disguise MIDNIGHT RUN as being anything more than aa enjoyable slice of commercial comedy thriller , Jack and Johnathan make a good double act mainly down to the character interaction and on screen performances . DeNiro at the time was a legend due to his roles in very memorable movies like TAXI DRIVER , RAGING BULL and ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA and I can remember thinking at the time why would he want to appear in such a commercial movie , but he's not disappointing in what's essentially a straight role . Such a pity he seems to confine himself to mediocre commercial movies these daysA word of warning though - Never watch a TV version of this movie because it ruins all the jokes , an example being " I've got two words for you - Shut the fk up " which is transmitted on TV as " I've got two words for you - Shut up " which does kill the humour of the lines
468367	1532177	61405	7.0	Not All That Far Fetched	BILLON DOLLAR BRAIN features a rabid anti communist meglomaniac in the role of villain General Midwinter and it's up to British agent Harry Palmer to stop his lunatic scheme I wonder how many people at the time realised the irony of rabid right winger Midwinter being portrayed as a looney villain ? In 1967 President Johnson was spending billions of American dollars and tens of thousands of American lives to protect South East Asia from communism while plenty of main stream right wing American politicians like Ronald Reagan thought the Johnson administration weren't going far enough to protect the free world from the red menace . So the over the top rhetoric from Midwinter feels more like biting satire than the rantings of a mad man . It's also good to see a movie making a nod towards the sacrifice of nearly 30 million Soviet citizens lives during the second world war , many of them being murdered by nationalists from puppet regimes created by the Nazis . I think this is undoubtedly the best of the Harry Palmer movies , helped in no small part by Ken Russell's not quite mainstream , not quite art house direction . Caine is in good form as are the rest of the cast , but of course the best performance award goes to Ed Begley as General Midwinter who rants about the evils of communism and preaches the virtues of the free world without pausing to draw breath . BILLION DOLLAR BRAIN also features early appearances from Susan George and Donald Sutherland in blink and you'll miss them roles . Entertaining thriller and an interesting one for not making the commies the bad guys . Compare it to THE GREEN BERETS if you want to know the difference between chalk and cheese
469274	1532177	60736	7.0	Cultural Relativism	THE NAKED PREY is very similar in many ways to Cornel Wilde's later movie NO BLADE OF GRASS in that it deals with the theme of survival , is rather violent and features real life stock footage mixed in with the location footage , and while neither film is all that well directed they both have very thought provoking plots of which THE NAKED PREY is more subtle . Yeah NO BLADE OF GRASS is shockingly thought provoking but that's entirely down to the John Christopher source novel rather than the adapted screenplay or Cornel Wilde's sledge hammer direction telling us what a terrible thing ( yawn ) pollution isThe premise of THE NAKED PREY is white man getting chased through African bush by black natives but the movie never becomes racist or reactionary and even more refreshingly is devoid of any patronising liberal right on attitudes . Wilde's hero called simply " The Man " is an innocent victim who happened to have the misfortune of being a safari guide to a bunch of philistines , but hey everyone has to make a living . The natives who while not exactly being painted in the most sympathetic light do have a motive for their amoral stance - One of moral relativism . It should also be pointed out that the natives do weep tears for their dead kinsmen and are capable of respect too . The screenplay never talks down to its audience by having tribal chiefs suddenly speak pidgen English when it suits the narrative nor are we shown subtitles but it's easy to tell what's going on . The fact that Clint Johnston's and Don Peters screenplay was Oscar nominated says a lot about its quality A good film mainly down to the fact that it treats the audience with some respect and doesn't degenerate into a slightly obvious MCGUYVER type plot . Having said that I did mention earlier that it's not all that well directed with obvious stock footage used . It's also obvious in the early chase scenes that Wilde's character is wearing flesh coloured briefs when he's supposed to be naked and I wished I could have seen a few more of those cruel and inventive executions which probably says a lot about me . Maybe some day we will see a remake set in the Brazilian rain forest with a guide escorting a bunch of environmentalist do gooders stomping through the jungle telling indiginous tribes how to live their lives and being confused as to why the natives want to impale them on a pole . Everything is down to respect
469683	1532177	1061123	7.0	Fair Enough Story Which Will be Remembered For The Stunt Casting Rather Than The Plot	It seems that DOCTOR WHO has now become part of Christmas and I for one am glad of that . I always used to receive a DOCTOR WHO annual without for my Christmas as a youngster . Ironically enough a few minutes after seeing this Christmas I caught a snippet of CORONATION STREET where a child character was trying out their " human Dalek " mask seen in Daleks In Manhatten . It says something of the show's success when BBC merchandise makes an appearance in an oppositions show As for the episode itself it will be for ever remembered as " The one with Kylie Minouge " which isn't really a bad thing . Whilst being enjoyable this episode by Russell T Davies is far from original . I'm all for traditional ( read scary ) stories but basically it's a remake of the 1977 story Robots Of Death where instead of passengers being murdered by voc robots they're being murdered by robotic angels . Throw in some of THE POSIEDON ADVENTURE and you've got television by numbers . I shouldn't criticise too much because it was much better than the previous year's special and this episode got almost 14 million viewers making it the second most watched programme of the year - only the EASTENDERS episode the same day got more viewers !
470104	1532177	330093	7.0	I Laughed Out Loud	This BRASS EYE special PAEDO-GEDDON was swamped by complaints ( More on that later ) when it was broadcast in 2001 following a national debate around a possible " Sarah's law " following the abduction and murder of school girl Sarah Payne . In fact it's scheduling was delayed while Phil Collins took legal advice after he found out he'd been fooled by the show's maker Chris Morris into a starting a campaign entitled Nonce-senseIf truth be told this show is probably more remembered for the controversy than the content which is in very poor taste but I do confess that I laughed out loud . The edition centres around paedophiles and how society treats both them and their victims . Chris Morris plays the presenter who tells the audience that an infamous paedophile has been launched into space then confesses that an eight year old child has accidentally been placed into the capsule along with the paedophile . Cue the child's frightened screams . Like I said very poor taste Other highlights of the show include Dr Fox giving a scientific lecture that paedophiles share an identical nervous system to crabs ( " No one knows this but it's a scientific fact " ) Labour MP Barbara Follet giving a public warning about equipment paedophiles put on their genitals while surfing the net and Kate Thornton warning viewers that paedophiles can send gas through the internet which makes young children suseptable to sexual predators including one victim " Who was once a shy innocent child and who now has the sexuality of a sixty year old Colonel " . Morris also shows a police officer in the child protection squad a serious of photos wanting to know if they're classed as obscene . The photos included Barbie surrounded by a marital aids and a composite photo featuring a young boys head , a dog's body and an erect penis that could only have belonged to John Holmes . Hey I never said this show was tasteful did I ? It's impossible to mention PAEDO-GEDDON without the hypocritical fall out that surrounded it where politicians , childrens organizations and policemen rushed to condemn the show for making fun of a very serious subject . The show was poor taste despite me laughing all the way through it but it's a biting satire . Perhaps the critics should take a long hard look in the mirror where a liberal elite allows convicted paedophile slime to walk around the streets of Britain before they criticise a mere TV show for exacerbating tensions .
468465	1532177	74860	7.0	Classic Thriller	MARATHON MAN starts off with a blackly comical scene of a fatal car crash and just gets better . William Goldman is a legendary screenwriter and seeing his script play out it's easy to see why . It's not often we're treated to a screenplay this intelligent anymore . But the best thing about MARATHON MAN is Laurence Olivier . Sir Larry is nowhere near regarded as highly as a film actor than he was as a stage actor but here he gives an unforgettable performance as a Nazi war criminal . It would have been very easy for Olivier to play the part as a parody but he's unbelievably convincing as both a mass murderer and a doctor . This is one performance in which Olivier deserved an Oscar nod
470227	1532177	75066	7.0	Probably The Best In The Series	THE PINK PANTHER movies ? Started off well but then soon outlived their welcome in my opinion , I mean a French policeman with a silly accent , just how much milage can you get out of that ? But this 1976 offering is probably the best in the series simply down to the fact the best laughs are darkly comical rather than slapstick , an early example with Clouseau asking " How ? " to be followed a couple of minutes by a laugh out loud scene featuring a couple of old ladies . There's also a very funny sub plot of the world's best assassins trying to bump off Clouseau which includes several funny scenes . I don't feel any guilty at laughing at people dying in this movie There are some weaker points like an overlong scene where Inspector Quinlan gives a shocked look which is embarrassing rather than amusing , and as some of the other people on this page has mentioned the movie does feel rather episodic at some points but I have no hesitation in saying this is Blake Edwards funniest comedy
468564	1532177	125042	7.0	Impressive Animation	This a very short film lasting five minutes and if it was filmed with actors playing characters it would have failed since it has little plot and is composed of an irritating mother taking her son to a reptile house while giving him her life story while asking him the occasional question as to what's happening with his life So what makes COMBINATION SKIN impressive as a short film isn't Anthony Hodgson's script but his animation which is similar to that seen in SHREK and it's unsurprising that Hodgson contributed to that groundbreaking movie as an animator . I would have liked the visuals to have concentrated a bit more on the residents of the reptile house as we see a brief and touching scene of a poor tortoise lying on its back waggling its limbs but over all this is an impressive animated short film thanks to Hodgson's animation and the voices of Jane Horrocks and Teresa Gallagher
469061	1532177	105699	7.0	One Of The Better Films From The Sub-Genre	It's interesting to note how forgotten the sub-genre of " People from hell " films are today . In the early 1990s every major studio would bring out a nanny from hell , a lodger from hell , a fan from hell , a client from hell etc etc . Perhaps the reason they're forgotten is down to the fact that the movies weren't very good and suffered from being formulaic ? Certainly UNLAWFUL ENTRY is one of the more entertaining movies in its field and it's probably down to the cast . Kurt Russell who unfortunately seems to have disappeared from successful films over the last few years was always good at playing good guy everyman and here plays architect Michael Carr . Madeleine Stowe is someone else who seems to have disappeared from the radar recently plays his wife Karen and they both make a likable and believable on screen couple with Karen being the object of lust of sociopathic cop Pete Davis played by Ray Liotta . Okay I doubt if any of the cast were expecting Oscar nominations but the on screen chemistry makes UNLAWFUL ENTRY a very watchable film There are some problems . Liotta is good enough when Davis is just an ordinary cop but when he acts all mean , nasty and obsessive he does tend to go over the top and unlike his two co-stars you can't really scratch your head wondering why Liotta now appears in obscure straight to video / DVD movies . Likewise the screenplay does became more and more unbelievable in the second half but that's always the problem with these type of movies . Not to be too negative it's still a watchable piece of entertainment
469616	1532177	66769	7.0	Effective Chiller But Drags At Points	I remember seeing THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN as a child and being terrified by it mainly down to the opening scenes of a USAF unit going into a deserted village to retrieve a crashed satellite and finding . . . . You'll have to watch the movie to find out what . But after re-seeing the movie again as an adult I can still say the opening sequence is heart stopping in its tension simply down to the fact that the audience is allowed to use its imagination as to what has happened to the villagers and the recovery team . This is one of the most effective openings I have ever seen in a science fiction movieUnfortunately it's impossible for the production to keep up the tension though I will give credit for everyone involved in trying . It's just that for reasons of plot the story then revolves around a small team of uber scientists sitting in an underground lab researching something they've found from outer space and finding a way of making sure it doesn't wipe out life on Earth . The main problem is that the story then starts getting bogged down in scientific fact which makes it very difficult for the audience , then to appease the audience the last ten minutes involve a literal race against time which wouldn't look out of place in a James Bond movie . I guess a mainstream audience member who disliked the massive amount of techno-babble on display perked up at the exciting countdown at the end while a microbiologist student who understood the technical dialogue wished the movie had ended on a more intelligent note There are one or two other slight problems . I did find Dr Ruth Leavitt , written and played as some beatnik intellectual very irritating . But I guess if THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN was remade today we'd see Hilary Duff or Lindsay Lohan as a nobel prize winning scientist so let's not complain about Kate Reid's performance too much . Unless I missed something isn't there a plot hole involving a crashed Phantom jet ? What caused it to crash ? Surely it couldn't have been exposed to the alien visitor unlike say the helicopter that brought back the satellite But I shouldn't nit pick too much since THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN is a very effective sci-fi chiller though a more modern audience might be put off by a large amount of talky scenes and an absence of special effects
468721	1532177	59895	7.0	Memorable B Movie	From what I know about screen writing the more credited writers a film has the worse the narrative is supposed to be . I genuinely think this is nonsense and perhaps CITY UNDER THE SEA is proof of this . It's a movie that has three people involved in he screenplay but is far more entertaining and involving than a great number of films I've seen that have only one screenwriter First of all let's get the bad points out of the way . You don't need a University degree to know that there's no volcanoes off the coast of Cornwall which seems to be included to set up the ending and the back story of the gillmen are conspicuous by its absence . Also if you're a fan of Poe and you watched this movie expecting it to be an accurate adaptation of one of his works then you'll almost certainly feel cheated . The casting of two American characters in two lead roles to appeal to an American market does seem forced , especially when you've already got a well known American actor as the film's villain . Hammer films didn't bow to this type of casting so I've no idea why it's done here In fact CITY UNDER THE SEA plays very much like one of the better Hammer productions concentrating on atmosphere rather than gore . When the film concentrates on this aspect it is genuinely frightening as early in the film when one of the gillmen prowls around the house . I must have been about seven years old when I saw this scene and remember being terrified by it . I saw this scene again earlier today and was not disappointed which is a great compliment coming from me . It's a film that is not Oscar worthy but is great entertainment nonetheless
468986	1532177	114474	7.0	One Of The Better Films To Have Been Produced In Scotland	SMALL FACES is a Scottish film set in Glasgow during the late 1960s and follows the lives of three brothers from the Maclean family : Bobby a member of the Glen Gang , Alan who has ambitions of going to art school and Lex a thirteen year old boy and like the character of Taylor in PLATOON where the main character finds himself being split between the violent pragmatism of Barnes and the humanity of Elias young Lex is split between what brother makes the better role model It's a complex tale that is character driven which explains why none of the comments on this page has really gone in to the plot details and if you're expecting a violent tale with youths slashing each other with razors every five minutes then you'll be disappointed . There is violence of course and some people may bleat that it lives up to the " Glesga keelie " stereotype but I disagree and it's interesting to note that the traditional battle lines of Glasgow gangs being drawn from their ethnic background ( Irish Catholic and Scottish Protestants ) is never discussed . Despite having a small budget director Gillies MacKinnon makes the most of what he's got and watch the scenes where characters view Tongland ( Is it the notorious Gorbals ? ) which resembles a bleak alien city . The cast are uniformly excellent with veterans like Clare Higgins and Ian McElhinney appearing alongside up and coming Scottish actors like Kevin McKidd and Laura Fraser but the two best performances are by Iain Robertson as Lex and Garry Sweeney as gang leader Charlie Sloan which is just as well since most of the movie rests or falls on these two characters , though strangely neither young actor has gone on to have a sparkling career which is a pity
470332	1532177	75765	7.0	Perceptions Change	Despite being set in the 1970s I couldn't help noticing that Robert Shaw's Mossad agent Kabakov is shown as being a violent ruthless cold blooded killer who's almost as bad as the terrorists he's hunting . This goes slightly against the common perception in much of the world at the time of Israelis being heroic and plucky freedom fighters striving to defeat terrorism and it should be remembered Israel carried out the legendary raid on Entebbe the year before . It wasn't untill Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982 that this perception changed towards the state of Israel somewhat . Well I suppose the producers should be congratulated on bringing ambiguity to the story . Likewise the " villain " Lander is a terrorist motivated by the fact that his country has turned his back on him . Sent to fight people in South East Asia he was shot down and left to rot in a North Vietnamese POW camp and on returning home from the most dirty and needless war of the 20th century he finds that even his own wife has forgotten about him . The point being that terrorists are never born but made . BLACK SUNDAY is a very good political thriller full of good but often violent action scenes which means it's not a film for everyone . Likewise watching this film in the 21st century which involves a plot to kill tens of thousands of innocent people at a public event means many viewers will be uneasy watching this . Sometimes you can take a plot and make it a little too realistic
469435	1532177	23858	7.0	The One Set In The Sawmill	One thing that puzzles me is how many of these L & H shorts feature absolutely no plot but I never seem to notice this because I'm too busy laughing . BUSY BODIES is set in a sawmill but that's it , there's no central plot , just a series of incidents which show the genius of Stan and Ollie . This is certainly one of the best shorts because it showcases the duo at their most typical , Ollie gets gets hit over the head by falling objects while Stan turns to the camera and shrugs . There's also a fight scene that had me in stiches , okay I knew what the pay off was going to be as soon as Stan said " Cigar " but you'd need to be crippled by clinical depression not to surpress a smile at this A seventy year old black and white film with no plot and it made me laugh . I can't think of a better compliment
470081	1532177	120370	7.0	What Sad Creatures	I'm a DOCTOR WHO fan and being a DOCTOR WHO fan often means making negative and sometimes downright nasty comments on least liked eras of the show . I hate the era of the mid to late 1980s and quite happily boot the boot into the series made between 1985-89 . In short being a fan of the show is like being a football supporter who spends his weekends at matches shouting for the manager to be sacked . There , that's what it's like to be a DOCTOR WHO fan . What we don't do is dress up as Sontaran battle fleet commanders , or learn the Sea Devil dialect , and under no circumstances do we wish to be tarred with the same brush as STAR TREK fans . Why ? Well watch TREKKIES to find out what I mean . TREKKIES was produced as a documentary but it turned out to be the biggest unintentional laugh-fest I've ever seen . Are we expected to swallow that STAR TREK fans are normal intelligent people ? Okay then let's take a look at these normal intelligent people . . . . . . The first person to be interviewed is a transvestite trekkie , and seeing as he / she is only filmed in extreme close up I'm just curious as to what he / she was wearing at the time . I've got a suspicion he / she was wearing one of these sexy little mini dresses from the original show . I hope he / she shaved her / his legsThe dentist whose wife and children are dressed in ST uniforms and whose dental surgery is decked out as a ST shrine called " The Starship Dentalprise " The Greenstiens who spend every day dressed in their USS Enterprise uniforms and who don't have any children ( Did anyone faint in surprise upon knowing this ? ) but have a poodle also dressed up in a ST uniform . It goes without saying it's the dog I feel sorry forA bunch of people dressed as Klingons order their lunch in a klingon dialect . The voice over informs us they do a lot of " community service " ( Probably a euphamism for work fare - Would you give them a job ? ) and that they " Visit sick children in hospital " . I've got to confess that if I had a child in hospital I'd want them to meet klingons as much as I'd want them to meet Victor Salva or Michael JacksonThe James Doohan anecdote of the suicidal fan . This isn't as heartwarming as has been made out . In fact when Scotty finishes with the line " She wasn't getting the help she needed " I shouted out " None of the people I've seen so far are getting the help they need " . This brings me to the saddest fan of the lot who is the lad who owned Captain Pike's life support / travel machine which resembles a headless Dalek . The fan turns up at an electrical store to buy some batteries and stuff only to get a weird reaction from the store worker who eyes dart from right to left very suspiciously and who has a " WTF " expression plastered all over his face . The reason for this attitude is explained when the fan leaves the store in the same transport he arrived in , yes that's right he came in the Captain Pike life support / transport machine and now drives off at 2 mph with his gormless face sticking out of the transporter . I can't wait to see TREKKIES 2
469088	1532177	118749	8.0	A Great Film On A Difficult Subject	Despite hearing all the great reviews about Paul Thomas Anderson's BOOGIE NIGHTS I only went out of my way to watch it due to voyeurism . No not that type of voyeurism you dirty lot , I was simply curious to see what someone has to do to break into the world of pornography . You might like to know that an infamous British tabloid used to advertise for what's euphemistically known as " Video models " in its classified column . I had a rough idea what this involved but there was no way I was going to apply but that didn't stop me from wondering why anyone would want to get caught up in this business and after seeing BOOGIE NIGHTS I now know that it's for sad unhappy people desperate to make money This is a sad , haunting , compelling film . Eddie Adams a hustler of sorts works as a dish washer where he has a chance meeting with porn director Jack Horner who eventually makes him a porn star and the film charts the rise and fall of Horner's porn company from the late 70s to early 80s . It's character driven so Anderson has to make his characters sympathetic and memorable . We see the weak willed Little Bill who wife taunts him by having sex with strangers , Buck Swope whose main ambition in life is to open his own hi fi store , Amber Waves who has a drug problem and trouble getting access to her children etc . You certainly may dislike what these characters do but you'll find them gaining your sympathy rather than your hatred due to their sad damaged lives . Being a porn star might sound attractive on the surface , especially before AIDS came along , but it's a career that leads to self destruction Anderson has written a very good script but that's not much use if he can't get the best out of his cast but he succeeds . He has cast very reliable character actors like Julianne Moore , William H Macy , Luis Guzman and John C Reilly who as you can imagine do their best with the script but casting Mark Wahlberg and Burt Reynolds as the two key characters Eddie and Jack seems like professional suicide and amazingly they're both outstanding . I don't think I've seen Reynolds ever give a better performance than the one here and if you just know him via crap like STRIPTEASE prepare to be blown away Obviously this isn't a film to watch with your parents or even with a bunch of friends on a night in . It's not often that Hollywood produces such an intelligent film and it's a pity that BOOGIE NIGHTS seems to have been a victim of poor timing where it was released in between LA CONFIDENTIAL and TITANIC ensuring that it missed out on more critical acclaim and awards . It did pick up three Oscar nominations but it deserved so much more . Perhaps the Academy didn't want to spoil the 27 year old Anderson with too many nominations at such a tender age ?
468885	1532177	264679	8.0	Is It Possible Hitchins Didn't Go Far Enough ?	If you've never heard of Christopher Hitchens let me explain he's the only person in the world who makes Professor Richard Dawkins look like a happy clappy vicar . He's a radical atheist who is openly hostile of religion . Dawkins uses scientific arguments to illustrate his belief that there is no god . Hitchens on the other hand is not a scientist but his cynicism towards religion makes him far more accessible to a mass audience , and over the years this expose by Hitchens on Mother Teresa has taken on legendary status . Such a pity that it's difficult to track down , but all you have to do is type in to any search engine " Hitchins Hells Angel " and you might be presently surprised how easy it is to findHitchens does not for a moment pretend this is going to be objective - It's a hatchet job on someone who is somewhat regarded even amongst secularists as someone who has brought hope and joy to the destitute and needy in the slums of Calcutta . Early on we're shown a clip from a 1969 documentary by ( in ) famous Christian Malcolm Muggeridge who started the Teresa myth by proclaiming that a miracle had happened , but this so called miracle involving light is easily explained by the cameraman going in to details as to how it's all down to the film in the camera . Strange to say that despite all the publicity and donations she has received her hospice has not changed one bit 25 years later . People still lie on stretcher beds with their heads shaved and the image to quote one former nurse who worked there " resembles Belsen . . . where the dying and stricken are given nothing stronger than aspirin as a painkiller . . . and where dirty needles are washed in cold water to be used again " Abortion and Teresa's attitude to it is next in Hitchens sights . We're shown footage of her stating that " The greatest destroyer of world peace today is the cry of the unborn child being murdered in her mother's womb " then footage of a rally in Ireland where she states her dogma against abortion and birth control . It's at this point journalist Mihir Bose points out that she's a crusader for reactionary hardline Catholic dogma and why so many leaders of western democracies admire her so much But perhaps it's not so much western leaders she should be remembered for meeting according to Hitchens " She may not comfort the afflicted but has never been known to afflict the comfortable " . she shakes hands with Ronald Reagan , a sponsor of right wing death squads in Central America , Haitian despot Papa Doc Duvalier and laying a wreath on the tomb of Stalinist dictator of Albania Enva Hoxa . Hitchens poses the question that why is she renowned as being " Mother Teresa Of Calcutta " when in fact she seemed to spend most of her life preferring to shake hands with the ( not ) great and ( far from ) goodIf I have any problem with HELLS ANGEL it's that might have pulled his punches just a little bit . It's a well known fact that whenever Mother Teresa fell ill she would go to America to be treated by the world's leading and most expensive doctors . Apparently what was good enough for dying penniless beggars in the Indian subcontinent wasn't good enough for her , and I don't think Hitchens hammered this point home enough in this documentary though to be fair Hitchens has certainly made up for it in articles over the years . But still it's a very well argued documentary which should be seen by anyone who's sitting on the fence where religion and its hypocrisy is concerned
468677	1532177	60637	8.0	A Thinking Man's War Film	Remember that Henry Fonda movie THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE ? That's the war movie that was set in the fog shrouded snow bound forests of the Ardennes in December 1944 but for some reason the movie's big set piece battle takes place on an arid desert plain . LOST COMMAND starts with a very similar error in geography involving the battle of Dien Bien Phu where the French built a heavily fortified base in the middle of a mountainous jungle in 1954 , except this film would have us believe that the battle took place in the middle of a desert ! But I'm more than willing to forgive this goof as LOST COMMAND is a good film , it's maybe not a great film but if you like action adventure / war films you'll hopefully enjoy this as much as I did and director / Producer Mark Robson should be congratulated for making a film showing the French fighting man in a good light . Say what you like about French political leaders but France does have a long noble military tradition with a glorious defeat being every bit as courageous as a glorious victory . But the screenplay doesn't glorify conflict and rightly points out that violence breeds violence , it pits former friends against one another , and it's always the most innocent who suffer the most
469852	1532177	67128	8.0	One Of The Best British Films Ever Made	Michael Caine has often said that GET CARTER was the first gangster movie not to portray gangsters as either being stupid or funny . He's right , but he could also have added that this was probably the first film not to show gangsters as being sexy in anyway . Sure Glenda , Magaret etc might be physically attractive but sexy ? I don't think so . And the men aren't any less unattractive , almost all of them are cowardly two faced weasels or violent thugs and often these character traits overlap . Director Mike Hodges has made a bleak , nihilistic classic film . He isn't flashy unlike present day film makers associated with gangster flicks but that's not a criticism . I love the way Hodges makes use of the locations in showing the North East of England as a cold , austere windswept urban area of high rise council estates and red brick terraced houses with outside toilets . There is a train of thought that by showing the audience all this it dates the film but it's also true that it reminds us that living standards are also different today . No one takes a phone call in the pub because everyone has a mobile phone nowadays , the internet and videos have replaced slide shows and silent 8mm as the medium for porn , and it's now illegal to dump the slag from coal mining into the sea because of EU regulations GET CARTER also has some really great dialogue which I could sit here all day quoting . But I won't bother except to say my favourite line is when Carter jumps out of bed naked and holds a gun on Con and PeterCon : Put it away jack you know you won't use it Peter : The gun he's talking about classic dialogue from a classic film
469397	1532177	209144	8.0	No One Likes A Smart Ass	Being voted number 10 in the IMDB poll I was really looking forward to MEMENTO but after watching the first few minutes I was confused as to what was going on . Then I realised it was a thriller being told in segments backwards so that the next segment finishes where the previous one finished . Then I wondered where it was heading but I spent so much time admiring the structure , story telling technique and sheer audacious skill of Christopher Nolan's super smart script I forgot to look for all the clues that explain the story . That's the problem with this film : There's clever , then there's too clever by half , and then there's Christopher Nolan's script
468436	1532177	54387	8.0	A Firm Favourite	The original film version of THE TIME MACHINE is almost certainly the best adaption of any of H G Wells work and deserves its status as a classic SF film . That's not to say it's without flaws , it starts very slowly and I found Filby's obviously false Scottish accent very irritating ( Notice when a Scotsman appears in a SF film or series his accent is poor ? Scottie from STAR TREK , Jamie Mcrimmon from DOCTOR WHO etc ) , but once the hero goes off into the future it's entertainment all the way . Special mention should go to the very intelligent script , it does simplify much of Wells subtext but also adds an anti war theme , you can actually believe the hero's thought processes came out of the mouth of Wells , and during the nuclear war the Earth show's its anger at mankind with a series of devastating volcanic eruptions . Is this the first time that " the Gia Theory " has appeared on film ? Perhaps the greatest compliment I can pay this film is that it reminded me of the early DOCTOR WHO stories . Praise indeed
468503	1532177	78788	10.0	My All Time Favourite Movie	I first saw APOCALYPSE NOW in 1985 when it was broadcast on British television for the first time . I was shell shocked after seeing this masterpiece and despite some close competition from the likes of FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING this movie still remains my all time favourite nearly 20 years after I first saw it This leads to the problem of how I can even begin to comment on the movie . I could praise the technical aspects especially the sound , editing and cinematography but everyone else seems to have praised ( Rightly too ) these achievements to high heaven while the performances in general and Robert Duvall in particular have also been noted , and everyone else has mentioned the stark imagery of the Dou Long bridge and the montage of the boat traveling upriver after passing through the border How about the script ? Francis Ford Coppola is best known as a director but he's everyway a genius as a screenwriter as he was as a director , I said " was " in the past tense because making this movie seems to have burned out every creative brain cell in his head , but his sacrifice was worth it . In John Milius original solo draft we have a script that's just as insane and disturbing as the one on screen , but Coppola's involvement in the screenplay has injected a narrative that exactly mirrors that of war . Check how the screenplay starts off all jingoistic and macho with a star turn by Bill Kilgore who wouldn't have looked out of place in THE GREEN BERETS but the more the story progresses the more shocking and insane everything becomes , so much so that by the time reaches Kurtz outpost the audience are watching another film in much the same way as the characters have sailed into another dimension . When Coppola states " This movie isn't about Vietnam - It is Vietnam " he's right . What started off as a patriotic war to defeat communist aggression in the mid 1960s had by the film's setting ( The Manson trial suggests it's 1970 ) had changed America's view of both the world and itself and of the world's view of America It's the insane beauty of APOCALYPSE NOW that makes it a masterwork of cinema and says more in its running time about the brutality of conflict and the hypocrisy of politicians ( What did you do in the Vietnam Mr President ? ) than Michael Moore could hope to say in a lifetime . I've not seen the REDUX version but watching the original print I didn't feel there was anything missing from the story which like all truly great films is very basic . In fact the premise can lend itself to many other genres like a western where an army officer has to track down and kill a renegade colonel who's leading an injun war party , or a sci-fi movie where a UN assassin is to eliminate a fellow UN soldier who's leading a resistance movement on Mars , though this is probably down to Joseph Conrad's original source novelMy all time favourite movie and it's very fitting that I chose this movie to be my one thousandth review at the IMDb
468800	1532177	189058	10.0	Oh Good , There's Lesbian Sex In This	ROSEBUD features no dialogue and no real plot . The story consists of a young woman ( Played by the very attractive Julie Graham ) who accidentally comes across her two lesbian neighbours making love on a roof top and the young woman ( Played by the very attractive Julie Graham . Good casting by the way ) fantasizing about gay love and then finding and accepting herself as a lesbian . This is a truly great masterwork of cinema featuring several scenes of naked pretty young women making love . If like me - and just about every red blooded man on the planet - you believe there's nothing wrong with same sex relationships as long as it features pretty young women putting on a public show then you will not only want to see this film but want to buy it on video and watch it again and again and again . If you're a gay man you'll think this is the worst film ever made And perhaps one day we'll see a big budget Hollywood remake starring Penelope Cruz and Kate Beckinsale . Oh yes please
